AB- In the past decade, the Israeli Ministry of Social Affairs has been engaged in an ongoing effort to change the capacity of social service organizations and social workers across the country to use and create knowledge in order to achieve the best outcomes for the people they serve. Although there is an ever-growing mandate in Israel to demonstrate outcomes and use effective strategies, social workers have historically experienced unique challenges in accessing and assessing available evidence-based practice when they are available. The first step to addressing these challenges, the intra-organizational phase, was to design, implement, and test a model of organizational learning designed to teach social workers how to use learning to change practice. The second step, the inter-organizational phase, was the introduction of virtual communities of practice as a tool to support workers in the acquisition and dissemination of new knowledge. This paper presents a case study of this effort including a description of the development and implementation of the two phases and an agenda for future research.

AB- Purpose: Autistic disorder (AD), Asperger’s syndrome (AS), and pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) have been removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fifth Edition (DSM-5). It now contains the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. This study assessed how people with AD and AS felt about the DSM-5 ASD criteria. Method: Phenomenological analysis of discussion forum dialogue among participants (N = 76) with AD and AS was conducted. Results: Discussions demonstrated agreement that the PDD-NOS diagnosis should be removed from the DSM-5. People with AD and AS were concerned about the inclusion of medical or neurobiological research, functioning, reciprocity, and gender bias in the ASD diagnosis. Discussion: Social workers should acknowledge the feelings of people with AD and AS when they use the DSM-5. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives: The study examined social workers’ apprehensions and expectations of the impending adoption of systematically planned, empirically based, outcome-oriented practice (SEOP). Method: Employing a mixed methods longitudinal design, the study used concept mapping to identify and map workers’ apprehensions and expectations and a self-reported questionnaire to measure their levels. Results: Apprehensions were that SEOP will increase monitoring and financial considerations in decision making and undermine professional intervention and professional responsibility. Expectations were that it will (a) empower social workers to provide better service and better cope with counterpressures and (b) systemize work procedures and improve organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and governance. Findings also showed that workers, who participated in formulating the system’s guidelines and principles, reported lower apprehensions and higher expectations than those who did not. Conclusions: In introducing SEOP, it is important to take workers’ apprehensions and expectations into consideration and to include workers in the development stage.

AB- Objective: This study attempts to uncover barriers to participation in a marital enrichment program that had been expected to be attractive to eligible couples. Method: Work products associated with a multiyear demonstration project were subjected to ethnographic analysis. Results: Eligible couples did not see congruence between the program’s goals and their needs, and some were alienated from community agencies. Also, program personnel and the social systems in which they were embedded could not use feedback to change. Conclusions: Recruitment success requires shared goals, good-enough personal relationships to support work on those goals, and subsystem flexibility, throughout the intervention system.

AB- Objectives: The present study examined the factorial invariance and functional equivalence of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) among the Chinese. Methods: A total of 839 undergraduate students completed the 240-item Simplified Chinese version of the VIA-IS online. Another 40 students participated in qualitative interviews to examine the meaning and function of the items in Chinese culture. Results: A total of 144 items were removed from the original version questionnaire (240-item) because of low item-loading and lack of cultural validity. A Chinese Virtues Questionnaire-96 (CVQ-96) in simplified Chinese containing 96 items (4 items per strength) was adopted. Three subscales (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) were developed after exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion: A theoretically meaningful 3-factor model of virtue, comparable to some virtue structures proposed in previous studies conducted in Western countries, was obtained. The inventories being developed can facilitate positive social work assessment and intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives: This article presents the validation of the 28-item Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28) among two Canadian samples of youth with complex needs. Method: The CYRM-28 was administered to two groups of concurrent service using youth in Atlantic Canada (n₁ = 497; n₂ = 410) allowing for use of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Reproducibility agreement is achieved and subscales of the measure are confirmed and show adequate psychometric properties. Conclusions: Findings add support to the CYRM-28 as a reliable and valid self-report instrument that measures three components of resilience processes in the lives of complex needs youth. Advanced statistical modeling yielded evidence that the scale, originally developed for use in various countries, can be used to assess resilience in youth from various ethnocultural backgrounds in Atlantic Canada.

AB- Practice and Research Together (PART) is an Ontario-based research utilization initiative, the core function of which is to distil and disseminate practice-relevant research findings to child welfare practitioners. This article addresses (a) the mission and goals of the PART program; (b) the key components of the program design; (c) the conceptual foundations of evidence-informed practice (EIP) as it relates to the program; (d) the successes and challenges of implementation to date; (e) the results of a comprehensive evaluation; and (f) areas for future research and development. Key findings of the formative evaluation include Link PARTners (LPs—organizational representatives) feeling isolated in their role in promoting organizational change; frontline practitioners reporting that they have little time or resources to use the program materials; supervisors stating that they support the concept of EIP but lack the skills and abilities to move these ideas forward; and executive directors are requesting more evidence to promote organizational and systemic change.

AB- Substance abuse researchers identify self-efficacy and group cohesion as important components in alcohol and other drug-dependency treatment. Objectives: The purpose of this single-group, pretest–posttest study is to explore the therapeutic value of a challenge course intervention on the self-efficacy and group cohesion of nine chemically dependent, adult females. Methods: Data were collected using two validated outcome measures administered before and after the intervention. Focus groups provided insight into the experiences of participants and were examined using manifest and latent theme analysis. Results: Findings indicate statistically significant improvements on both outcome measures with medium to large effect sizes.

AB- Objectives: Accreditation standards and challenges in group work education require competency-based approaches in teaching social work with groups. The Association for the Advancement of Social Work with Groups developed Standards for Social Work Practice with Groups, which serve as foundation competencies for professional practice. However, there has been no empirical publication about using them in teaching. This pilot study tested a microskills teaching approach to improve competency in the Standards. Methods: The mixed-methods study used a preexperimental, pretest–posttest design involving 123 diverse baccalaureate and master’s students in introductory group work courses. Student responses about the experience were also collected. Results: There were significant, substantial increases in students’ perceived importance of and confidence in using the Standards. Confidence gain scores were significantly associated with performance in role-plays. Comments about the assignments were highly favorable and identified role-plays as contributing most to learning. Conclusions: The teaching approach advanced Standards-based group work education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: A total of 6 years after displacement by a Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere (HOPE VI) project, this research examines residents who returned to the redeveloped community and residents who decided to keep their vouchers and were living in private sector housing. Respondents were compared on the following variables: application process and decision to move back, satisfaction with housing, material hardships, and perception of economic well-being. Method: The study employed a static group comparison research design. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 56 respondents through five focus groups. Results: Residents who moved back to the revitalized public housing were highly satisfied with their housing, had significantly fewer material hardships, and perceived their economic well-being more positively compared to residents remaining in the voucher program. Conclusions: Our results both support and expand upon previous empirical findings on the complex comparisons between voucher users and revitalized public-housing residents.

AB- Objective: A multistage, mixed-methods study using grounded theory with descriptive data was conducted to examine factors in disclosure of intimate partner violence (IPV). Method: In-depth interviews with individuals and focus groups were undertaken to collect data from 98 IPV survivors and service providers to identify influential factors. Quantitative data were also collected on adult trauma levels and child concerns from 20 women. Results: An ecological analysis revealed that IPV disclosure occurs within a complex interplay of distinct individual and environmental considerations. Specific system level factors of the ecological framework—ontogenic, micro, exo, and macro—emerged as influencing disclosure and ultimately shaped womens’ disclosure processes. Conclusion: IPV disclosure remains a "risky business" with perceived negative outcomes outweighing benefits. Results reinforce that social work interventions need to occur at all levels of the human ecology in order to provide effective responses.

AB- Objective: The purpose of this study was to pilot test a multicomponent program designed to prevent aggressive behavior in preschool children. The first program component was comprised of social–emotional skills training. It focused on improving the social information processing and emotional-regulation skills of children. The second component was a group-based parenting education. It focused on child development and discipline. Method: Participants, recruited from four preschools in high-risk neighborhoods within a large metropolitan area, were assigned to an intervention (n = 31) or a waitlist comparison (n = 36) condition. Using worker ratings and child puppet-play assessments, pretest and posttest data were collected on 14 child and caregiver/parent behaviors. Results: The gain scores of children in the intervention group differed significantly from those in the comparison group on academic competence, social competence, depression, and aggressive behavior. Caretaker gain scores differed significantly, favoring the intervention group on parental bonding, child supervision, communication, and developmental expectations. Conditioned on the limitations of the design, skills training for preschool children and their caregivers appears to promote social and academic skills.

Participants included 120 Chinese new immigrant parents with preschool children in Hong Kong from 13 preschools which were randomized into intervention group (HOPE) and comparison group (6-session parent education program). Parent participants completed measures on child behavior, parenting stress, social support and self-efficacy before and after intervention. The children were assessed on the WPPSI-R and receptive vocabulary before and after parent intervention. Results indicated significant decrease in post-intervention child behavior problems and parenting stress and increase in social support in the intervention group, compared with the comparison group. Implications for service delivery for parents of preschool children were discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: To examine the factors that influenced African American men's medical help seeking. Method: Thematic analysis of 14 focus groups with 105 older, urban African American men. Results: African American men described normative expectations that they did not go to the doctor and that they were afraid to go, with little explanation. When they did go, men reported that they were particularly uncomfortable with the tone physicians used when talking to them. Providers often made recommendations but offered the men little useful information on how to make lifestyle and behavior changes. Following receipt of care, spouses, medical test results, and men's desire to fulfill social roles were key motivating and instrumental factors in following medical advice. Conclusions: African American men's medical help seeking seemed to be negatively influenced by social norms and patient-provider interactions but positively influenced by spouses and the desire to fulfill social roles.

AB- Objective: This exploratory qualitative study examined factors contributing to expressive father role negotiation, salience, and commitment in a sample of nonresidential African American fathers (n = 18). Method: Two focus groups were conducted between 2000 and 2001 in a Midwestern city to understand factors that strengthen and diminish bonds between nonresidential African American fathers and their sons. Results: Results indicate that nonresidential fathers deepened their expressive role commitment by reflecting on socioemotional voids in their paternal relationships and negotiating role strains produced as they weighed giving time versus giving money. Conclusions: Findings support the need to foster expressive role commitment among nonresidential African American fathers as a strategy for enhancing child involvement. Social work research, interventions, and practice implications are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Police agencies across the country are struggling to respond to significant number of persons with serious mental illness, who are landing on their doorsteps with sometimes tragic consequences. Arguably, the most widely adopted approach, the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) model, is a specialized police-based program designed to improve officers’ ability to safely and effectively respond to mental health crises. Conducting research on CIT is challenging; thus, the evidence base is limited. In this article, the author reviews the emerging literature, present a conceptual model of CIT effectiveness, and describe a study of CIT in Chicago. Findings from Chicago suggest that CIT is increasing linkage to services and reducing use of force in encounters with persons with mental illness. Lessons learned are discussed.

AB- Objectives: This article describes the process of developing a culturally based family intervention for Spanish-speaking Latino families with a relative diagnosed with schizophrenia. Method: Our iterative intervention development process was guided by a cultural exchange framework and based on findings from an ethnographic study. We piloted this multifamily group 16-session intervention with 59 Latino families in a randomized control trial. Data were collected on family- and client-level outcomes, and poststudy focus groups were conducted with intervention participants. Results: Preliminary evidence indicates that the intervention is effective by increasing illness knowledge and reducing family burden. Conclusions: This work can provide a model for how to integrate cultural factors into psychosocial services and enhance interventions in real-world settings for culturally diverse populations.

AB- Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the reliability and validity of the North Carolina Family Assessment Scale (NCFAS) among families involved with youth mental health services. Methods: Using NCFAS data collected by child mental health intake workers with 158 families, factor analysis was conducted to assess factor structure, and thematic analysis of intake notes was used to test content validity. Results: This study found only three NCFAS subscales. The case notes included themes specific to youth with mental health needs that were not captured by current NCFAS items. Conclusions: This study suggests variation in the fit for the NCFAS in child mental health services compared to the measurement properties established in child welfare samples.

AB- Objective: According to a prior study, there are substantial lapses in journal coverage in the Social Work Abstracts (SWA) database. The current study provides a replication and extension. Method: The longitudinal pattern of coverage of thirty-three journals categorized in SWA as core journals (published in the 1989-1996 period) is examined. Results: The proportion of issues missing from SWA is significantly greater than 0, increase over time, and is significantly biased in favor of NASW journals. Conclusion: The errors in SWA reported here, combined with those previously reported, will exert a long-term negative impact on scholarship unless their existence becomes known to all SWA users and they take steps to compensate for the situation.

AB- Objective: The dynamics of interactions between evidence-based intervention (EBI) developers and trainers and organizations and providers that deliver the EBI was examined in two case studies, a statewide randomized effectiveness trial of an EBI to reduce child neglect and a randomized trial of EBIs for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in children and adolescents. Methods: Data were collected using ethnographic methods of participant observation and semistructured interviews and analyzed using grounded theory analytic methods. Results: Formal and informal interactions between EBI propagators and end users provide access to resources and exchange of global and local knowledge of service delivery. Productive interactions require accessibility, mutual respect, a shared language, and a willingness to engage in negotiation and compromise to resolve differences in demands imposed by organizational culture, the need for EBI fidelity, and client characteristics. Conclusion: A cultural exchange characterized by information sharing and behavioral change through a process of negotiation and compromise is central to evidence-based practice in youth serving systems of care.

AB- Background: The National Evidence-Based Practices (EBPs) Project developed and tested a model for facilitating the implementation of five psychosocial EBPs for adults with severe mental illness in the United States. Methods: The implementation model was tested in 53 sites in 8 states. In each site, one of the five EBPs was adopted for implementation and then studied for a 2-year period using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings: At baseline, none of the sites had programs attaining high fidelity. Four factors were identified as influencing fidelity: (a) EBP-specific factors, (b) governmental factors, (c) leadership factors, and (d) fidelity review factors. Conclusion: A multipronged implementation strategy was effective in achieving high fidelity in over half of the sites seeking to implement a new EBP.

AB- This study evaluates the impact of a college-based dormitory program on transitioning youth with intellectual disabilities. A qualitative study, with interviews at pre and post, was conducted to evaluate the program’s impact. Data were collected with semistructured interviews from young adults with intellectual disabilities who participated in a college-based residential program and their parents or guardians. Three general themes emerged from the data: Participants reported experiences that were (a) typical of normative life transitions, (b) typical of growing pains associated with significant life transitions and learning new skills, and (c) one step forward. Results indicate that the experience of living away from home for the first time was in some ways comparable to that of a typical college student. Improvement in life skills, including increased awareness of personal goals, enhanced vocational goals, increased maturity or assertiveness, was reported. Respondents were generally satisfied with the program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article reports the results of a mixed-method study that examined processes and outcomes of parent-worker engagement in child welfare. Knowledge gained from a qualitative exploration of engagement at one neighborhood-based child welfare agency informed the gathering of quantitative data from 74 different parent-worker dyads in this sequential exploratory design. Seven themes instrumental to engagement emerged: (a) clear, collaborative goal setting; (b) hopefulness; (c) parent acknowledgment of their situations; (d) motivation; (e) respect for cultural differences; (f) honest and straightforward communication; and (g) persistent and timely efforts by all. Quantitative analyses yielded little relationship between engagement and either visitation rate or case disposition by 9 months post placement. Although these data provide support for the clinical benefits of working to improve parent-worker engagement in child welfare services, they fail to provide evidence of a relationship between engagement and improved case outcomes.

AB- This study examined group leaders' adherence to The Incredible Years Parenting Program's components and collaborative process during a yearlong dissemination in a large multicultural city and universal prevention context. Mixed methods were used to evaluate adherence and develop an understanding of the barriers and facilitators of therapist fidelity. Results suggest that the protocol and collaborative group processes were implemented with a high degree of adherence with the three exceptions of role plays, videotape modeling dosage, and "buddy calls." A number of interconnected barriers with implications for future implementation were identified. Key contributors to adherence included the training and structure of the program, emphasis on accountability and ongoing session monitoring, and important aspects of supervision and group leader qualities.

AB- The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of reflective counseling group supervision (RCGS) for military counselors. A convenience sampling method is adopted. Twenty-two military counselors participate in this study. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods are used for collecting and analyzing data. The results support our hypothesis that participants who received the RCGS would show a significant increase in their counseling competences. Four primary categories related to supervisory style, supervisory alliance, self-assessment, and supervising outcomes emerge as prominent and consistent from participants' learning experiences. RCGS can be an effective supervision model for participants. Implications of the findings for group supervision and further research are discussed.

AB- Recently, social work has been influenced by new forms of practice that hold promise for bringing practice and research together to strengthen the scientific knowledge base supporting social work intervention. The most recent new practice framework is evidence-based practice. However, although evidence-based practice has many qualities that might attract social workers to adopt it, use in practice is limited. Accordingly, attention is being given to determine effective strategies for the dissemination, adoption, and implementation of evidence-based practice. This article examines the implementation literature, describes alternative strategies for implementation of evidence-based practice in social work, describes an implementation study to illustrate concepts discussed, and specifies needed research.

AB- This article presents propensity score matching as a method to implement randomized conditions to analyze service effects using nonexperimental data. Most social work research is challenged to implement randomized clinical trials, whereas administrative and survey data are often available and can provide valuable information about services received under naturalistic conditions. This article discusses the assumptions of this method and the analytic steps involved; and it presents three examples of the approach, demonstrating that it is possible to approximate the conditions of a randomized controlled trial, and when selection bias is reduced, investigators can have more confidence in their findings.

AB- Objective: To reduce mental health symptoms and high-risk behaviors and increase social support and service utilization among street-living youth, the authors conducted a pilot study to assess the feasibility of the social enterprise intervention (SEI) at a homeless youth agency. Method: Convenience sampling was used to recruit 16 street-living youth from the agency. SEI participants received 7 months of vocational and small business training and service referrals. A comparison sample of 12 agency youth was used. Results: Findings from independent sample t tests demonstrate that SEI participants displayed significant improvements at 9 months in life satisfaction, family contact, peer support, and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that the SEI was feasible within the agency setting and associated with higher mental health and social outcomes.

AB- There has been little research on intimate partner violence (IPV) in faith-based communities. This qualitative study examines social attitudes and religious values in an Ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that affect the incidence of IPV and prevent women survivors from seeking help. Interviews were conducted with 8 Orthodox women and 11 community leaders, and findings include the following: (a) causes of IPV were early marriage, separation of the sexes, and personality characteristics; (b) religious beliefs and social values were barriers to seeking help; and (c) the role of rabbis in education and marital intervention was viewed in markedly different ways by the two sets of respondents. Implications for practice and further research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Many minority adolescents in the United States today are at a high risk for truancy, dropout, and academic underachievement. Truancy is related to a host of preceding and subsequent risks such as delinquency and limited vocational outcomes. Using participatory research methods, this federally funded, 10-month study assessed youths' perceptions of a publicly funded, faith-based, alternative education program with 73 minority youth participants who were at risk for truancy. The study assessed whether change occurred in peer dynamics, youths' use of time, and educational aspirations. The program was found to have a positive impact on peer dynamics and the use of both school hours and free time. The program supported or did not hamper educational aspiration. Implications about the impact of alternative education programs for at-risk youth and the faith-based nature of the program are discussed.

AB- Objective: A national online survey assessed the views of 973 faculty members in master of social work programs regarding their receptivity toward, definition of, and views of disparate sources of evidence pertinent to evidence-based practice (EBP) and the teaching of EBP. Method: Due to Internet-related technical difficulties, the response rate could not be precisely determined; however, it was at least 33% and conceivably much higher. Results: Although the large majority (73%) of respondents expressed a favorable view toward EBP, disparities are identified among respondents in both the definition of EBP and views regarding the EBP research hierarchy. Conclusion: Efforts appear to be needed to increase agreement regarding the definition and conceptualization of EBP among educators, with special attention to divergent views regarding what constitutes sufficient evidence to guide practice decisions or to convey that an intervention is evidence-based.

Methodology: Three successive cohorts were assessed for statistical equivalence and evaluated using a one group pre- and postdesign followed by a booster session. Dependent variables used self-reports of caregivers' empowerment, emotional outlook, parent-child interaction, and community involvement. The analyses included paired t tests and repeated measures. Results: All outcomes evidenced statistically significant and practically meaningful positive trends subject to design limitations. Conclusions: The adaptations met the program needs of targeted participants. Future recommendations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: This study evaluates participant perception of neighborhood, economic, and housing well-being of residents 4 and 5 years after forced relocation from a public housing complex in Atlanta, Georgia. Method: The study used a mixed-method, posttest-only design with two data points. Focus groups with 93 participants combined qualitative, open-ended questions with quantitative measures. Results: Four years after relocation, residents living in homes/apartments found with Section 8 housing vouchers were faring better than residents who moved to other public housing projects. A majority of voucher users believed their house, neighborhood, and overall global living situation had improved since relocation. In the year between the first and second wave of focus groups, 40% of voucher users had moved to a new house/apartment. Moving was associated with residents perceiving their situations improving in many categories. Implications: Our findings suggest HOPE VI developments are more likely to accomplish their objectives if the current administration continues full funding of the voucher program rather than implements the cutbacks it is currently proposing.

AB- Objective: This article describes the first-year evaluation outcomes of a program developed to increase information technology access and skills among foster children and families within the context of a long-term foster care environment. Method: A sample of 34 foster families who received computers, Internet connection, and supportive services was compared with 30 foster families not in the program using survey methods and a posttest only design. Results: The results indicated after a year in the program, foster families increased their frequency of computer use, confidence in using computers and the Internet, and frequency of e-mail with social workers. Parents and foster children perceived the program to be useful in improving children's technology skills, homework, grades, and interest in technology-related careers. Conclusion: The program appears to be successful in spite of lack of full implementation of the program model. Implications for future digital divide programs are discussed.

AB- Objectives: The respect that African American youth feel promotes psychological wellness and social identity; conversely, a lack of respect compromises their identities and is viewed as a threat to safety. This article describes the development, psychometric analysis, and validation of the African American Respect Scale, a 20-item instrument measuring prosocial attitudes held by male adolescents. Method: The scale was administered to 200 African American male youth age 14 to 18 years; 100 were incarcerated in juvenile corrections facilities, 100 resided in the community. Results: After acceptable reliability was established, factor analysis revealed three principal components labeled societal, family, and peer subscales. The subscales correlated with racial socialization and predicted the use of violence. Nonincarcerated youth scored significantly higher on all three subscales than incarcerated youth. Conclusions: Suggestions for social work practice with African American youth include assessing their attitudes toward respect, and assisting them to handle disrespect without resorting to violence.

AB- This pilot study presents findings from a project to evaluate a program initiated by a state child welfare agency for its most hard-to-serve youth (N = 46). This emerging population is so dangerous and unmanageable that they are difficult, if not impossible, to place or treat. One state responded to this challenge by providing exceptional care through two residential treatment facilities who followed a no-eject, no-reject policy. Outcome data show that 85% of children had reductions in state-designated level of care and movement to less restrictive treatment placements. Differences in Children's Global Assessment Scale scores for Cohort 1 were statistically significant (t = -4.947, df = 24, p &lt; .001). Staff assessment interviews delineated target behaviors, putative causes, mechanisms for change, and outcomes for children who successfully completed the program.

Method: This study reports the results of a two-stage study of courts and the CW system. Stage 1 used direct, systematic court observations to identify critical features of effective and problematic courts. The second stage used interviews with judges, CW agency attorneys, and staff to identify factors that facilitate or impede timely safety and permanency decisions for children. Results: The results well document the need for making changes in the functioning of courts in CW cases. Implications for the continuing professional development of CW staff, improving the effectiveness of courts, CW practice, and future research are discussed.

Method: The study analyzed multiple forms of qualitative data, including semiannual formative evaluations and semistructured interviews of participating partners. Results: Both the collaborative method and the infusion of technology were central to the functioning of collaboratory projects and, ultimately, the translation from research to practice and policy. The community-based participatory nature of the research projects resulted in applicable findings that were credible with people affected by the issues studied. Conclusions: The present study suggests that when there is steadfast commitment on the pan of a diverse group of partners, even simple applications of technology can make a difference.

AB- This article examines survivor perspectives of the effectiveness of two different treatments for trauma symptoms among adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuse--Eye movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and eclectic therapy. Method: Qualitative interviews obtained in the context of a mixed-methods study were conducted with 38 adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Results: Two major differences in outcomes between the two treatment approaches were observed. There were considerable distinctions between the two treatment groups in terms of the importance and effect of the client-therapist relationship, and in terms of the depth of change reportedly caused by the different therapies. Conclusions: Survivors' narratives indicate that EMDR produces greater trauma resolution, while within eclectic therapy, survivors more highly value their relationship with their therapist, through whom they learn effective coping strategies.

AB- The present study provides information on the reliability and validity of the Transracial Adoption Parenting Scale (TAPS), a multidimensional 36-item Likert-type scale that measures cultural competence among transracial adoptive (TRA) parents. The TAPS was theoretically developed and refined through feedback from experts in TRA adoption. A cross-sectional survey design was used with a national nonprobability sample of 1,411 TRA parents. Each parent completed the 53-item TAPS and three other instruments with which to examine criterion and construct validity. After a preliminary factor analysis of the 53-item TAPS, the authors found that 36 items were retained in six factors. The 36-item TAPS had excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91), concurrent and discriminant validity were supported. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the TAPS holds promise of being a psychometrically sound instrument with which to measure cultural competence among TRA parents. Further investigation is warranted.

AB- Objective: To describe the development and validation of the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS), a 17-item instrument designed to measure intrusion, avoidance, and arousal symptoms associated with indirect exposure to traumatic events via one's professional relationships with traumatized clients. Method: A sample of 287 licensed social workers completed a mailed survey containing the STSS and other relevant survey items. Results: Evidence was found for reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and factorial validity. Conclusions: The STSS fills a need for reliable and valid instruments specifically designed to measure the negative effects of social work practice with traumatized populations. The instrument may be used to undertake empirical investigation into the prevention and amelioration of secondary traumatic stress among social work practitioners.

AB- Objective: This article reports the initial development of the Alcohol and Other Drug Self-Efficacy Scale (AODSES). Method: The scale instrument is designed to measure social workers 'perceived self-efficacy of their substance abuse knowledge and skills with MSW practitioners (N = 399). Results: Factor analysis revealed six subscale factors in the initial scale development composed of 43 items, accounting for 76% of the variance with excellent internal reliabilities. The six subgroup factors were moderately correlated. Conclusions: Given the reliability and validity of the scale, it may be useful in agency settings to evaluate and measure social workers' confidence in treating clients who have alcohol and other drug problems. Replication of the study is a necessary next step with another group of social workers for further external and internal validation.

AB- Objective: This study (a) evaluated a batterer intervention program (BIP) by investigating changes in psychological variables (i.e., truthfulness, violence, lethality, control, alcohol use, drug use, and stress-coping abilities) between pretreatment and posttreatment assessments in a sample of court-mandated batterers and (b) investigated the differential effectiveness of this same BIP for African American and Caucasian batterers. Method: The study employed a one-group pretest/posttest design, with 12-monthfollow-up data, to investigate changes in Domestic Violence Inventory (DVI) scores among 91 men, 57% African American, court ordered into a BIP. Results: Analysis indicated that (a) court-ordered batterers demonstrate significant changes, in the desired direction, on psychological variables related to domestic violence, as a result of participation in a court-mandated BIP and (b) there was no significant difference in changes on these psychological variables between African American and Caucasian batterers. Conclusion: Implications of the findings for enhancing intervention efforts with court-ordered batterers were discussed.

AB- Objective: Existing studies of lay explanations of poverty in the social work literature are plagued with methodological problems. The psychometric properties of the 13-item Chinese Perceived Causes of Poverty Scale (CPCPS), which assessed four categories of explanations of poverty, were examined. Method: Chinese parents and their adolescent children from 229 families experiencing economic hardship were asked to respond to the CPCPS. Results: Results consistently showed that four factors were abstracted from the scale: Personal Problems, Exploitation, Lack of Opportunity, and Fate. The four related subscales were also found to be internally consistent, and there was some support for their construct validity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the CPCPS possesses sound psychometric properties. The findings also point out the importance of empirically demonstrating the existence of measures assessing different constructs when social work practitioners and researchers examine lay explanations of poverty.

AB- In response to the rapid increase of the elderly population, assisted living facilities have quickly developed as a housing alternative for elders who are no longer able to live alone in the community but do not yet need nursing home care. Research suggests that whereas many assisted living residents experience depression, few receive needed mental health services. Objective: Examine the effectiveness of a group treatment program in promoting the psychological well-being of depressed assisted living elders. Method: Seventeen elders participated in 10 group therapy sessions that combined remotivation and supportive therapy techniques. Pre- and posttest measures and a program satisfaction survey were administered by research assistants. Results: Following the conclusion of the twice weekly sessions, participants experienced a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and a significant increase in life satisfaction and perceived social support. Conclusion: The utility and efficacy of the integrated group treatment model is suggested by study findings. Further research is warranted.
