AB- Objective: This study examined the validity and reliability of a person-directed care (PDC) measure for nursing homes in Korea. Method: Managerial personnel from 223 nursing homes in 2010 and 239 in 2012 were surveyed. Results: Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis for the first sample generated a 33-item PDC measure with eight factors. Item analysis for the second sample resulted in 32 items. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the acceptability of the revised instrument with seven factors of 30 items (χ2 = 650.96, root mean square error of approximation = .059, nonnormed fit index = .88, comparative fit index = .90, and incremental fit index = .90). The overall scale had high internal consistency and reliability (α = .925). Conclusion: Findings from this study confirm the validity of the revised Korean PDC scale.

AB- Objective: Little empirical attention has been paid to the validity scales of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC). The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of cases identified by the validity scales and its analytical impact. Methods: The current study compares regression models using data from two community samples (n = 3,724 and n = 2,245) and two samples of at-risk youth (n = 1,758 and n = 204). Using Chow tests to compare coefficients, we demonstrate the implications of removing cases identified by the TSCC validity scales. Results: The Underresponse (UND) scale identified 8% of the community sample and 20% of the at-risk sample. Chow tests revealed significant group differences based on the UND scale for all TSCC subscales. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the analytical impact of the TSCC validity scales and provides statistical evidence for the removal of invalid cases.

AB- Objective: This research examines the psychometric properties of two subscales of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) Multicultural Council’s Organizational Cultural Competence Assessment, which together have been used to assess organizational cultural competence in child welfare agencies. Method: Confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to analyze data on 478 child welfare workers. Results: Six models were generated based upon the theoretical literature. The best-fitting model was unidimensional (χ² = 13.18, df = 9, p = .15; root mean square error of approximation = 0.03; comparative fit index = 0.99; Tucker–Lewis Index = 0.99). Discussion and applications to social work: Factors that are more proximal to client interaction were stronger indicators of organizational cultural competence than those that were more distal. Those wishing to examine organizational cultural competence in voluntary child welfare settings should consider using the validated form of the AUCD instrument.

AB- Objective: This article brings the discussions on incorporating perceived importance across study areas into the study of client satisfaction and cautions the use of multiplicative scores (multiplying satisfaction and importance scores) as a weighting method. An alternative weighting method is provided. Method: Analyze data from a client satisfaction survey of 103 clients of a publicly funded elderly case management service unit located in a large U.S. Midwest region city. Results: The alternative weighted score correlated higher with all the global client satisfaction measures than the multiplicative score. Conclusion: Using multiplicative scores to represent global client satisfaction should be avoided. The proposed alternative weighting method is a reasonable way to incorporate perceived importance to represent global client satisfaction.

AB- Objective: Because forgiveness is an important aspect of studies in marital relationships, there is a need for a culturally relevant measure of forgiveness for Chinese couples. This study aims to validate the Transgression-related Interpersonal Motivations Inventory in marital relationships within a Chinese context (C-TRIM). Method: Data were collected from 665 married individuals in Hong Kong who completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results: It is suggested that C-TRIM is a one-factor scale consisting of 12 items. It is also found that C-TRIM and benevolence are two distinct dimensions in measuring forgiveness in a marriage. C-TRIM represents negative forgiveness, whereas benevolence refers to positive forgiveness. Conclusion: C-TRIM demonstrates to be a valid and reliable scale with which to assess the forgiveness level of individuals toward their offending partner in Chinese communities.

AB- Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to explore psychometric properties of two versions of the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory in a Swedish social service sample. Method: Social workers employed at 22 Swedish child protections agencies participated in the data collection. Both classic test theory approaches and Rasch analysis were used. Seventy-five (46 double) protocols of the Early Childhood version and 65 (43 double) protocols of the Middle Childhood version were obtained. Results: The interobserver reliability and Rasch reliability displayed acceptable results. Targeting was satisfying for the middle and more adequate home environments. However, there were mixed results concerning model fit. Conclusion: The scores may be used to identify families with inadequate home environments where children may be at risk.

AB- A number of proxies have been used in child welfare workforce research to represent actual turnover; however, there have been no psychometric studies to validate a scale specifically designed for this purpose. The Intent to Leave Child Welfare Scale is a proxy for actual turnover that measures workers’ intention to leave. This scale was validated in the current study by a CFA. The resulting factors were compared to actual turnover. Nearly two in three workers who indicated that they had considered looking for a job in the past year actually left their agencies (60.0%). A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the Intent to Leave Child Welfare Scale. The best fitting model consisted of three factors with acceptable fit statistics (X 2 = 28.6, p = 0.04; RMSEA = 0.05, 90% RMSEA CI = 0.01-0.08; CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.98). Identified latent factors included “thinking,” which included observed variables related to workers thinking about leaving their current jobs; “looking,” which included observed variables related to workers searching for a new job; and “acting,” which included observed variables related to workers actually taking physical steps to seek a new job. Once a good fitting model was identified, binary logistic regression was conducted to determine odds ratios to predict who actually left their agencies. Each of the identified latent factors was significantly predictive of actual leaving (thinking: OR = 1.24, p = 0.00; looking: OR = 1.25, p = 0.00; acting: OR = 1.28, p = 0.01).

AB- Purpose: This study describes the development and validation of the Group Climate Instrument for Children aged 8 to 15 years (GCIC 8-15), which purports to measure the quality of group climate in residential care. Methods: A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on data of 117 children in Dutch residential youth care. Reliability analysis was performed and concurrent validity was tested. Results: An adequate fit of a two-factor model indicated construct validity of the GCIC 8-15. Reliability coefficients were good, and a significant correlation between perceived group climate and treatment motivation supported concurrent validity. Discussion: The GCIC 8-15 can be used to identify positive and negative aspects of group climate in residential youth care and enables further group climate research with children.

AB- Purpose: This article describes the development and validation of the Undergraduate Perceptions of Poverty Tracking Survey (UPPTS). Method: Data were collected from 301 undergraduates at a small university in the Northeast and analyzed using exploratory factor analysis augmented by random qualitative validation. Results: The resulting survey contains 39 questions and has six factors that meet empirical standards for validity and reliability. The UPPTS provides information regarding undergraduate students’ perceptions of those living in poverty in three areas: (1) general attitudes toward those living in poverty, including a sense of the students’ underlying explanation for why someone may be poor; (2) understanding of and empathy for those living in poverty; and (3) commitment to addressing poverty via direct action or support for programs/services that aid those in poverty. Discussion: The UPPTS builds upon the concepts of a lack of social empathy and cognitive distancing as principal reasons why people fail to do more to help the poor via either direct action or support for programs that will aid the poor. Further, social work and other educators may use the UPPTS to guide their efforts in poverty education and to track the progress of their efforts with undergraduate students.

AB- Objectives: This study is the first review to be conducted to evaluate measures of wandering behavior for identifying people with dementia at risk of getting lost. Method: Drawing upon systematic review search strategies, the relevant literature was reviewed for wandering instruments using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The psychometric properties of these were evaluated with reference to establishing the risk of getting lost. Results: The search yielded 34 instruments. Of these, one wandering-specific measure and four measures of behavioral change in dementia met inclusion criteria. The ability of these to confidently evaluate the risk of getting lost remains uncertain. Conclusion: Further research is required to more fully evaluate the psychometric properties of the retrieved instruments. This process is made complex by difficulties in defining wandering and getting lost and methodologically, by the absence of a criterion reference. Methodological developments are required to enhance assessment-focused reviews in the psychosocial intervention field. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: This study describes the development and validation of the Sorokin Psychosocial Love Inventory (SPSLI) measuring love actions toward a former spouse. Method: Classical measurement theory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were utilized with an a priori theory and factor model to validate the SPSLI. Results: A 15-item scale containing five subscales (intensity, extensity, purity, adequacy, and duration) showed good fit, statistically significant factor loadings, good reliability, and validity. Multigroup CFA indicated both measurement equivalence and structural equivalence between males and females. Discussion: The SPSLI supports Sorokin’s multidimensional theory of love and provides clinicians a method to measure love actions of divorcing individuals. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives: The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ). The reliability, factor structure, construct validity, and temporal stability of the inventory were examined. Method: A university student sample (n = 878) and a working adult sample (n = 153) were recruited. Participants were asked to complete the paper-and-pencil CVQ and a set of questionnaires to measure both their positive and negative psychological status. Results: The results supported the three-factor structure of the CVQ established earlier. Factorial invariants were found in different subsamples (students vs. workers; male vs. female). Each factor (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (α = .87 to .92), test–retest reliability (r = .70 to .76), convergent validity, discriminant validity, incremental validity, temporal stability, and theoretical significance. Conclusions: The questionnaire with good psychometric characteristics and solid cultural foundations can facilitate positive social work assessment and intervention.

AB- Objective: The purpose of this study was to validate the 10-item DSSI as a brief measure of social support for use in diverse adult populations. Methods: EFA was performed on 2010 Arizona Health Survey (AHS) data (n = 8215). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) then confirmed the factors structure by gender, ethnicity, and age, as well as for the total population. DSSI-10 and subscales were compared with variables related to social support. Results: CFI confirms this structure exhibits a good model fit. Low self-reported health status and low self-reported quality of life were related to lower DSSI scores. Living alone was significantly negatively related to the DSSI-10. Conclusions: Researchers may confidently use DSSI-10 to measure social support for diverse adult populations. This instrument can be used in epidemiological studies to increase understanding of mental and physical health in relationship to social supports in the general population.

AB- Social systems, particularly family, school, and peer, are especially critical in influencing adolescents to participate in volunteer service; however, no objective measures of this construct exist. Objectives: This study examined the psychometric properties of the Family, School, and Peer Influence on Volunteerism scale (FSPV) among Chinese adolescents. The FSPV is an instrument that assesses the perceived influence of these social systems on adolescent volunteerism. There are nine identical items for each of the three systems. Method: The FSPV was administered to 2,819 early adolescents in Hong Kong. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed four factors, namely, "Family," "School," "Peer," and "Extrinsic influence." The FSPV also demonstrated good internal consistency, construct validity, and criterion-related validity. Conclusion: The psychometric properties of FSPV are adequate in the assessment of the perceived influence of social systems on volunteer service participation in Chinese adolescents.

AB- Objectives: The concept of recovery has begun shifting mental health service delivery from a medical perspective toward a client-centered recovery orientation. This shift is also beginning in Hong Kong, but its development is hampered by a dearth of available measures in Chinese. Method: This article translates two measures of recovery (mental health recovery measure and the recovery subscale of peer outcomes protocol) and one measure of recovery-promoting environments (recovery self-assessment) into Chinese and investigates their psychometric properties among 206 Hong Kong Chinese people with severe mental illness. Result: Multifactor solutions from earlier studies were not replicated; our evidence pointed to one-factor solutions. Since all recovery measures demonstrated high internal consistency reliability (.92 to .96), we analyzed total scale scores. Conclusion: Moderately high correlations among the recovery measures (.33 to .56) provide some support for construct validity, yet further investigation of recovery measures in a Chinese population is needed.

AB- Objectives: The objective of this work was to assess the reliability and validity of the Treatment Motivation Questionnaire—Revised (TMQ-R) in people with serious mental illness (SMI). Method: A large sample of consumers of mental health services (n = 469) were administered the TMQ-R. Results: The factor structure specified in previous research did not fit the data well. However, a five-factor model with the two subtypes of introjected (i.e., feeling guilty about not attending treatment) and external motivation (i.e., pressure to attend treatment) fit the data well. Conclusions: The current analyses partially confirm the TMQ-R structure and reflect the need for future work to evaluate the complexities of motivational measurement within people with SMI.

AB- Objectives: Advancing human rights is a core competency of U.S. social work education; yet, human rights attitudes and behaviors have never been measured in the social work literature. Thus, this article describes the development and initial validation of two scales, Human Rights Engagement in Social Work (HRESW) and Human Rights Exposure in Social Work (HRXSW). Method: The scales were validated using a purposive sample of 287 social work students. Results: Factor analysis supported a 25-item HRESW and an independent 11-item HRXSW. Reliability was assessed: HRESW (α = .894) and HRXSW (α = .734). Conclusions: The HRESW and the HRXSW have direct applicability to social work education. Through measuring exposure and engagement, we can begin assessing the quality of human rights education in social work.

AB- Objective: The purpose of the study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Chinese Cultural Beliefs about Adversity scale (CBA). Methods: The CBA was administered in a sample of 275 Chinese parents experiencing economic disadvantage. Results: The CBA was found to be internally consistent. Consistent with the conceptual framework, factor analyses showed that two stables factors were abstracted from the scale. The scale and subscale scores of the CBA showed correlation with parental attributional beliefs of children’s success and failure to effort and luck, respectively, thus supporting the construct validity of the measures. Conclusions: The CBA is a reliable and valid measurement tool to measure Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity from the perspective of parents in the context of poverty.

AB- Objective: This study examines the factor structure of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18; Derogatis, 2001) in a hard-to-reach population of mainly undocumented migrant Latino day laborers. While, the BSI-18 has been found to be a valid and reliable measure of psychological distress, cross-cultural assessments in sub-groups of Latinos are scarce with this being the first study to examine the factor structure of the Spanish version of the BSI-18 with this population. Methods: A series of principal axis exploratory factor analytic procedures examining one to three-factor models were performed with a street recruited sample of 150 Latino migrant day laborers. Results: A one-factor model emerged and four items were dropped due to low factor loadings. The internal consistency coefficients for the 14-item BSI was α = .87. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the revised BSI-18 appears to measure a single dimension of general somatic-psychological distress in this sample of Latinos.

AB- Objectives: The present study examined the factorial invariance and functional equivalence of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) among the Chinese. Methods: A total of 839 undergraduate students completed the 240-item Simplified Chinese version of the VIA-IS online. Another 40 students participated in qualitative interviews to examine the meaning and function of the items in Chinese culture. Results: A total of 144 items were removed from the original version questionnaire (240-item) because of low item-loading and lack of cultural validity. A Chinese Virtues Questionnaire-96 (CVQ-96) in simplified Chinese containing 96 items (4 items per strength) was adopted. Three subscales (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) were developed after exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion: A theoretically meaningful 3-factor model of virtue, comparable to some virtue structures proposed in previous studies conducted in Western countries, was obtained. The inventories being developed can facilitate positive social work assessment and intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: This article describes the development of a measure of foundation competencies in group work derived from the Standards for Social Work Practice with Groups. Developed by the Association for the Advancement of Social Work with Groups, the Standards have not been widely used. An instrument based on the Standards can help advance evidence-based teaching and practice. Methods: Items were drawn from the Standards yielding a 70-item inventory measuring two domains for each item: how important the item is for successful group work and how confident the respondent is about demonstrating the skill in practice. Psychometric testing involved 426 mostly students. Results: The alpha for both the importance and the confidence subscales was .98, with low standard errors of measurement. Developed directly from the Standards, the inventory had prima facie content validity, further supported by expert ratings. Significant correlations between the subscales and validators supported a range of validity analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives: This article presents the validation of the 28-item Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28) among two Canadian samples of youth with complex needs. Method: The CYRM-28 was administered to two groups of concurrent service using youth in Atlantic Canada (n₁ = 497; n₂ = 410) allowing for use of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Reproducibility agreement is achieved and subscales of the measure are confirmed and show adequate psychometric properties. Conclusions: Findings add support to the CYRM-28 as a reliable and valid self-report instrument that measures three components of resilience processes in the lives of complex needs youth. Advanced statistical modeling yielded evidence that the scale, originally developed for use in various countries, can be used to assess resilience in youth from various ethnocultural backgrounds in Atlantic Canada.

AB- Objective: Professional social workers and emergency workers operating in war contexts may develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following exposure to traumatic events. Impact of trauma must be accurately assessed by researchers via robust models of measurement. In this article, measurement models for the 13-item Children’s Revised Impact of Event scale (CRIES-13), Arabic version were assessed in an adult population operating in a war context. Method: A sample (N = 218) of in-service adult Palestinian helpers was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Findings supported adoption of a bidimensional model comprising two normally distributed measures labeled intrusion and avoidance as a quantitative screening tool for PTSD in contexts of military violence. Conclusion: The solid psychometric properties of CRIES in an adult population suggest its use as a short version of the Impact of Event scale–Revised (IES), Arabic version (IES-R-13).

AB- Objective: To examine the validity and reliability of a new Arabic Filial Piety scale (AFPS) for use with informal Arab caregivers. Background: Filial piety, a term used to describe a set of family values in relation to parental care. This is the first measure of this construct for use with Arab populations in Israel. Method: A random sample of 250 informal Arab caregivers field tested a new AFPS (26 items in a 5-point Likert-type format).Validity and reliability tests were applied. Results: Principal component factor analysis extracted seven factors, which accounted for 58.8% of the variance: sacrifice; obligation; respect; face-saving; repay; intergenerational exchange; and family unity. The overall scale reliability was high (.83) with strong construct validity. Conclusions: The results support the unidimensional structure of the AFPS.

AB- Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are more common in severe mental illnesses (SMI) clients than in the general population, yet brief screens for detecting probable PTSD in SMI clients are nonexistent. In a two-part study, the authors used correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to develop and validate a 3-item PTSD scale derived from the PTSD Symptom scale (PSS) with SMI clients. Results from Study #1 (N = 220) revealed that a 3-item Brief PSS showed excellent accuracy for detecting PTSD, good internal consistency, and good concurrent validity with other relevant measures. In Study #2 (N = 327) comparable reliability and concurrent validity were found with measures similar to those used in Study #1. Practitioners are encouraged to use the Brief PSS with SMI clients, and if positive, conduct a full assessment and diagnosis. Limitations of the study include the lack of a structured interview for primary Axis I diagnosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Empathy is a core principle essential to social work. Despite this emphasis, minimal empirical research of empathy has been undertaken by social work researchers. The purpose of this study was to develop and initially validate the Empathy Scale for Social Workers (ESSW). The ESSW is a 41-item self-report inventory designed to assess empathy in social work practitioners. The sample (N = 271) consisted of social workers who had attained the Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. Findings revealed promising psychometric properties for the ESSW, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) demonstrated content, construct, and factorial validity. Results were encouraging and they lay the ground work for the continued development of the ESSW. This scale addresses a gap in social work knowledge regarding the empirical evaluation of empathy. Results have implications for social work as the scale may be used to assess student training needs and/or as a screening tool for social work supervisors and practitioners.

AB- Objectives: This article describes two studies related to the development of the Perceived School Experiences Scale (PSES). The PSES may be used by social workers to assess youths’ perceptions of three school-related protective factors, including school connectedness, academic press, and academic motivation. Method: In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory analyses were conducted on a calibration (n = 386) and cross-validation sample (n = 387) of middle and high school students. In Study 2, test–retest reliability and predictive validity were established on a sample of high school students (n = 97). Results: The resultant 14-item PSES demonstrated acceptable factorial validity and gender invariance in samples of middle and high school students. The PSES also demonstrated acceptable test–retest reliability, and correlated positively with perceived belonging and social competence. Conclusions: Overall, the PSES has important implications for social workers as they assess important protective factors and document the effectiveness of their interventions for the children and youth they serve.

AB- Objectives: This article describes the psychometric validation of the Youth Social Capital scale (YSCS) in 16- to 17-year-old students living in rural and urban areas in Crete, Greece. Methods: Sampling was performed among 27 secondary education units of Heraklion Prefecture. The self-reported questionnaire was answered by 692 participants (response rate 96.3%). The validation of the scale included both internal consistency and construct, convergent and discriminant validity tests. Results: Exploratory factor analysis yielded five social capital factors. The overall Cronbach’s a was coefficient .771. Factor analysis revealed common patterns for many questions between the Greek and the original scales. Conclusions: This article supports the validity of the YSCS for assessing the social context of young individuals in Greece.

AB- Objectives: The Employment Hope scale (EHS) was designed to measure the empowerment-based self-sufficiency (SS) outcome among low-income job-seeking clients. This measure captures the psychological SS dimension as opposed to the more commonly used economic SS in workforce development and employment support practice. The study validates the EHS and reports its psychometric properties. Method: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using an agency data from the Cara Program in Chicago, United States. The principal axis factor extraction process was employed to identify the factor structure. Results: EFA resulted in a 13-item two-factor structure with Factor 1 representing "Psychological Empowerment" and Factor 2 representing "Goal-Oriented Pathways." Both factors had high internal consistency reliability and construct validity. Conclusions: While findings may be preliminary, this study found the EHS to be a reliable and valid measure, demonstrating its utility in assessing psychological SS as an empowerment outcome among low-income jobseekers.

AB- Contemporary developments in social attitudes toward prostitution and prostitutes influence both social policies and the social work profession. Understanding individuals’ attitudes toward these issues is necessary for the development of social interventions and policies aimed at reducing stigmata attached to them. This article describes a new research measure for the assessment of attitudes toward prostitutes and prostitution (the Attitudes toward Prostitutes and Prostitution Scale; APPS), and outlines its development process. Results from pilot studies using the APPS are presented, alongside detailed information regarding the measure’s psychometric properties. The article concludes with a review of possible uses and limitations of the APPS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The present study demonstrates the development and initial examination of psychometric properties of the Intimate Violence Responsibility Scale (IVRS) in a community-based sample (N = 527). The underlying factor structure of the IVRS was tested by the exploratory factor analysis (Principal Axis Factoring), which identifies the four factors: partner blame, distal blame, minimization, and violence recognition. The internal consistency of the four subscales of the 20-item IVRS had an acceptable-to-good coefficient alpha ranging from .75 to .83. Evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity was established through correlational analyses. The initial findings of this study support that the IVRS is a reliable and valid self-reporting instrument that measures attitudes related to responsibility for violent behavior toward the intimate partner. Implications for practice and future research are specified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: The McKinney-Vento Act (MVA) is the primary federal policy addressing homelessness in America with specific mandates designed to ameliorate the effects homelessness has on educational attainment for school-age children. The extent to which this policy is implemented may have far-reaching effects for homeless children. The MVA Implementation Scale (MVAIS) was developed for the purpose of providing a tool for assessing school-based social services personnel’s perceived knowledge and awareness of implementation of the MVA within their service areas. This study tests the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the 26-item instrument. Method: Data were collected from a purposive sample of school social workers (N = 201) attending a Mid-Western regional conference in order to examine the reliability and the validity of this measure. Results: The hypothesized factor structures were confirmed. Findings also indicated high levels of reliability among items, as well as initial evidence of instrument validity. Conclusion: Findings from this study indicate that the MVAIS adequately measures participant’s perceived implementation of the MVA. Future implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB- Purpose: Student-mothers from low-income families are three times as likely to drop out of college as female students without children. Yet, the economic and social benefits of postsecondary education for low-income mothers underscore the importance of examining environmental barriers to completing college for these women. Methods: The intent of this study, therefore, is to develop and validate an instrument, the school support scale, aimed at measuring the perception of emotional and tangible college support among student-mothers from low-income families. Results: Findings show excellent reliabilities for emotional (α = .944) and tangible (α = .888) subscales and indicate that student-mothers who perceive faculty and staff as supportive tend to have strong commitments to the institution (p = .01). Applications: The 22-item scale can be used as an “early-warning” tool for college counselors and administrators to support student-mothers in identifying and removing barriers that contribute to problems associated with college retention of low-income mothers.

AB- Objective: The objective of this study was to test the factor structure of the parent version of the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS) in a sample of mothers who brought their children for community mental health (CMH) services (n = 280). Method: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the fit of the hypothesized four-factor structure and the empirically validated one-factor structure. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify what factor structure best fit our sample of distressed mothers. Results: Neither the one- nor the four-factor model fit our sample. The EFA suggested that the CIS was best understood as a 12-item, three-factor model that identified functional impairment: (a) at school/work; (b) in socializing; and (c) at home/family. Conclusion: These findings call into question the construct validity of the parent version of the CIS in a CMH sample of mothers and provide support for multidimensional measures of functional impairment.

AB- Objective: The present study provides psychometric data for the Trauma Practices Questionnaire (TPQ). Method: A nationally randomized sample of 2,400 surveys was sent to self-identified trauma treatment specialists, and 711 (29.6%) were returned. Results: An exploratory factor analysis (N = 319) conducted on a randomly split sample (RSS) revealed a 19-item, six-factor structure. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for the six-factor model on the second RSS (N = 320). The hypothesized model demonstrated adequate fit (comparative fit index [CFI] = .94 and root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .07). Post hoc modifications significantly improved model fit (CFI = .95 and RMSEA = .06). Alpha reliabilities ranged from .72 to .82. Conclusions: The TPQ has evidence of validity for assessing trauma practice patterns among clinical social workers and clinical psychologists.

Method: A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in order to evaluate the factor structure of the NFS. Results: A final, 8-item model, with two error covariances yielded the best fit of the NFS in the current sample. These findings suggest that, with some modification, the NFS is a very promising, short measure of perceived father nurturance that is applicable to African American youth from various family structures and who have varying amounts of interaction with their fathers while growing up.

Objectives: This study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Cultural Influence on Helping Scale (CIHS) among Chinese adolescents. CIHS is an instrument that assesses Chinese cultural influence on helping other people. Method: The CIHS was administered to 5,812 high school students in Hong Kong. Results: The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed three factors, namely, "Advantages of helping people," "Disadvantages of helping people," and "Self-centeredness," which support the hypothesized dimensions. The CIHS demonstrated good internal consistency. Construct validity and criterion-related validity were also supported. Conclusions: The psychometric properties of CIHS are adequate in the assessment of cultural influence on helping in Chinese adolescent samples.

Method: Social work practitioners, psychologists and LMFTs (N = 1001) were surveyed to assess the scale’s internal consistency reliability and criterion and factorial validity. Results: Findings support the scale’s internal consistency reliability, criterion and factorial validity. Conclusion: These findings support the use of the shorter version of the EBPPAS scale in surveys or to evaluate efforts to educate a wide range of behavioral health practitioners in EBP.

AB- Examined the internal consistency, construct validity, and factor structure of the Chinese version of the Interactional Problem-Solving Inventory, which, in the original Dutch version, assesses people's abilities to solve marital problems. 335 Chinese respondents (median age range 36-40 yrs) in Hong Kong with and without significant marital problems were recruited to fill in the inventory. The scale scores had an alpha value of .91. The inventory correlated with marital satisfaction and discriminated between groups with and without marital problems. Principal components analysis revealed 2 interpretable factors, namely, General Problem Orientation and Couple Communication. It is concluded that the Chinese version of the inventory demonstrates adequate internal consistency and construct validity for use in assessing marital problem solving in marital training and treatment.

AB- Objective: This report describes the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of a scale that assesses practitioners’ perceived familiarity with, attitudes of, and implementation of the evidence-based practice (EBP) process. Method: Social work practitioners and second-year master of social works (MSW) students (N = 511) were surveyed in four sites to assess the scale’s internal consistency reliability and criterion and factorial validity. Additional data on the scale’s criterion validity and sensitivity were gathered in pretests and posttests of 97 social workers participating in EBP continuing education workshops. Results: Findings support the scale’s internal consistency reliability, criterion and factorial validity, and sensitivity. Conclusion: These findings support the use of the scale in surveys or to evaluate efforts to educate students and practitioners in EBP.

AB- Objectives: This study describes the development and initial validation of the 15-item Ethnic and Racial Socialization of Transracial Adoptee Scale (ERSTAS). Method: Using the model of Boykin and Tom on Black family socialization, the items were developed and validated using two different Asian adoptee samples. Results: Two subscales, ethnic socialization and racial socialization, were identified through principal axis factor (PAF) analysis. The ERSTAS and its subscales demonstrate strong internal consistency as well as discriminant validity and correlate significantly with ethnic identity measures. Although the racial socialization subscale was significantly related to self-esteem and depression, the total scale and the Ethnic Socialization subscale scores were not. Conclusions: The ERSTA is a relatively short, easy-to-use, and theoretically developed measure. The initial psychometric properties of the scale highlight its utility within the transracial adoptee group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Method: This study developed the URICA—DV Korean Version and sought the most appropriate structure for a Korean context. The sample is 293 batterers either referred by the courts, by prosecution, or who participated voluntarily. Results: The original four-factor model and the two three-factor models are demonstrated as possessing poor model fit index and fail to be accepted as apt models for a Korean context. The suggested three-factor model is a better fit according to confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion: Findings and further discussion for practical implications and research are presented.

AB- Objective: Information on the shortened, 20-item version of the Perceived Social Support Scale (S-PSSS) is scarce. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the S-PSSS Family (SSfa) and Friends (SSfr) subscales. Method: Because of their common coping method of social support, a cross-sectional sample of Alzheimer’s caregivers was relevant for this evaluation. Self-reported data were collected from 229 participants at two caregiver conferences. Results: Factor analysis on each measure indicated a three-factor solution with all items loaded. Reliability was satisfactory. Correlational analyses and odds ratios indicated preliminary construct validity for SSfa and SSfr. Conclusion: The S-PSSS subscales appear to be psychometrically appropriate for potential use in appraising family and friend support among Alzheimer’s caregivers.

AB- Objectives: The respect that African American youth feel promotes psychological wellness and social identity; conversely, a lack of respect compromises their identities and is viewed as a threat to safety. This article describes the development, psychometric analysis, and validation of the African American Respect Scale, a 20-item instrument measuring prosocial attitudes held by male adolescents. Method: The scale was administered to 200 African American male youth age 14 to 18 years; 100 were incarcerated in juvenile corrections facilities, 100 resided in the community. Results: After acceptable reliability was established, factor analysis revealed three principal components labeled societal, family, and peer subscales. The subscales correlated with racial socialization and predicted the use of violence. Nonincarcerated youth scored significantly higher on all three subscales than incarcerated youth. Conclusions: Suggestions for social work practice with African American youth include assessing their attitudes toward respect, and assisting them to handle disrespect without resorting to violence.

AB- Objective: This report describes the development and preliminary findings regarding the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of a scale that has been developed to assess practitioners’ perceived familiarity with, attitudes about, and implementation of the phases of the evidence-based practice (EBP) process. Method: After a panel of national experts on EBP supported the scale’s content validity, social workers were surveyed by mail in Texas and Missouri to assess the scale’s internal consistency reliability and criterion validity. Additional data on the scale’s criterion validity and sensitivity were gathered in pretests and posttests of social workers participating in EBP continuing education workshops in Austin and San Antonio, Texas. Results: Preliminary findings support the scale’s internal consistency reliability, criterion validity, and sensitivity. Conclusion: In light of the current need and requests for this scale, dissemination of the preliminary findings is warranted while awaiting data collection at additional sites. These findings support the use of the scale to evaluate current efforts to educate students and practitioners in EBP. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives: This study developed and validated the Cyber-Counseling Objective Structured Clinical Examination (COSCE), a method and tool used to assess the competence level of trainees and professionals who practice cyber-counseling. Method: The COSCE’s development involved the creation of a cyber-counseling performance rating scale and two simulated client scenarios, and the recruitment and training of three raters. The COSCE was tested on six masters of social work students and six seasoned cyber-counseling practitioners. Results: We examined the COSCE’s internal consistency, interrater reliability, and interclient reliability. In addition, we assessed the construct validity through exploratory factor analysis and known-groups validation method. Conclusions: With further improvement, the COSCE can be a reliable and valid tool in assessing the competence of cyber-counseling practitioners.

AB- This study aimed to develop a scale which could be used as a valid way to show the evidence of recovery-oriented services. A 51-item scale was developed to assess both the component processes and outcomes of recovery. A sample of 471 participants administered the questionnaire. The factor analysis yielded a 45-item scale with six subscales, including three components of process and three outcomes. The construct validity was confirmed. Each subscale has very good internal consistency (α = .80—.95), and the 3—5 weeks test—retest reliability was .72. The scale could significantly differentiate the rehabilitation sample and the better functioning sample. The results indicated four stages of recovery. The external construct validity was also ensured. The results supported the psychometric property of the Stages of Recovery Scale (SRS). It could be utilized for both assessment and evaluation to document the evidence of a recovery-oriented program, collectively or individually.

AB- Objectives The current study presents an initial psychometric analysis of a three-dimensional scale designed to measure stereotyping of people who are single, defined as not currently legally married. Methods Following expert review, proposed scale items are administered to 178 graduate and undergraduate students. Reliability analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis are conducted. Results Coefficient alphas range from .87 to .91 on the proposed subscales and CFA result in all fit indices meeting recognized criteria for a good fit. Evidence for convergent validity is mixed. Conclusions The present analysis indicates that the scale has excellent reliability and factorial validity. More research is needed to support convergent validity. Future research with different populations and more specific focus on older, non-cohabiting singles is recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: The purpose of this article is to describe the method of item selection tested in the development of the Adolescent Domain Screening Inventory. Method: The convenience sampling frame used for these analyses consisted of 26,781 Communities That Care Youth Surveys. The three item selection methods were used to assess known instrument, convergent construct, and concurrent criterion validities. Results: Method 3, multiple regression on 30-day use, performed the best on the correlations with outcome scales and was indistinguishable from the others on the correlations with the original. Conclusions: This study suggests that the dominant method of short form item selection, factor analysis loading, might not be only method a researcher can employ and may not be best for all purposes.

AB- The authors report a validation study of the Teen Court Peer Influence Scale (TCPIS), a newly developed scale, to examine its factor structure, reliability, and evidence of validity. Methods: The scale was disseminated to 202 participants in six teen courts in the state of Florida, and the authors conducted exploratory factor analyses. Content validity was established conceptually and evidence of concurrent validity, convergent construct validity, and discriminant construct validity were established statistically. Results: Factor analyses suggest that positive peer influence is operationalized by three constructs: positive cognitions/expectations, positive identity development, and modeling/imitation. The TCPIS has good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of .90. Conclusions: The TCPIS shows preliminary evidence of sound psychometric properties and may be used to inform teen court policy and practice.

AB- Objectives: The Trauma Resilience Scale (TRS), assessing protective factors associated with positive adaptation following violence, was tested in three waves of data collection. Empirical and theoretical literature shaped subscale and item formation emphasizing resilience following physical abuse, sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and/or a serious threat or injury to life. Methods: Content validation experts helped refine items. The three-factor model, including problem solving, relationships, and optimism, was tested (n = 270). A four-factor model adding spirituality was also tested (n = 307). Results: Both models demonstrated strong reliability, validity, and factor analyses results. However, the four-factor model was best supported by the data. Conclusions: Both global scales and individual factor subscales are supported for clinical and research administrations.

Methods: Using NCFAS data collected by child mental health intake workers with 158 families, factor analysis was conducted to assess factor structure, and thematic analysis of intake notes was used to test content validity. Results: This study found only three NCFAS subscales. The case notes included themes specific to youth with mental health needs that were not captured by current NCFAS items. Conclusions: This study suggests variation in the fit for the NCFAS in child mental health services compared to the measurement properties established in child welfare samples.

AB- Objective: This study evaluates the factor structure and internal consistency of the Gregory Research Beliefs Scale (GRBS). Method: Data were collected from subject matter experts, a pilot study, an online sample, and a classroom sample. Psychometric analyses were conducted after combining the online and classroom samples. Results: An a priori four-factor model was not supported via confirmatory factor analysis. Principal component analyses were used to reduce the items to a one-factor model with salient structure coefficients, face validity, and a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.93. Discussion and Applications: Future research should evaluate factor invariance and the construct and criterion validity of the GRBS. However, given the limitations of scales that measure similar constructs, the GRBSs brings the social work profession closer to effectively quantifying an internally consistent and homogenous latent variable that may be related to evidence-based practice.

AB- Objectives: The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) is widely used in juvenile justice settings; however, little is known regarding its factor structure in antisocial youth. The authors evaluated the BSI factor structure in a state residential treatment population. Methods: 707 adolescents completed the BSI. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess factor structure. Intergroup variability was examined using multiple-group structural equation modeling. Results: Findings supported a 6-factor, 25-item model explaining 49.5% of sample variance. The derived structure differed from prior findings with adult psychiatric patients by including a suicidal ideation latent variable and excluding several developmentally inappropriate factors. Conclusion: There may be problems associated with indiscriminant application of the original BSI factor model to juvenile justice populations.

AB- Objective: Approved versions of the SF-36 Version 1.0 are used for limited-English-speaking individuals whose primary languages are Korean, Chinese, and Spanish to test the respective translations for use among immigrants to the United States. Method: Surveys are completed by an older adult and a nominated adult family caregiver (N = 132). Results: Adequate internal consistency and validity are found for Chinese and Spanish with the exception of the Social Functioning (Spanish) and Vitality (Chinese) Scales. The Korean version has reliability and validity issues. Comparisons are made with English language norms and studies that use translations in Spanish and Chinese. No comparative data for Korean Americans are found. Recommendations are made for reading reports of and using SF-36 translations. Conclusion: Paying attention to options in use of translations of the SF-36 in Chinese and Spanish improves the relevance of findings to research and practice.

AB- Objective: This article examines the psychometric properties of the Casey Foster Applicant Inventory-Worker Version (CFAI-W), a questionnaire designed to assess the potential of foster family care applicants to provide foster care. Method: Retrospective data were collected from 208 foster care workers who completed two copies of the CFAI-W, one for the best foster family and one for the worst foster family they had ever known. Results: The CFAI-W demonstrated excellent internal consistency reliability and evidence of predictive and discriminant validity. Conclusions: The CFAI-W can be used in combination with other methods to introduce standardization and accountability to the assessment of foster parent applicants.

AB- Objective: The Casey Foster Applicant Inventory-Applicant Version (CFAI-A) is a new standardized self-report measure designed to assess the potential to foster parent successfully. The CFAI-A is described, and results concerning its psychometric properties are presented. Method: Data from a sample of 304 foster mothers from 35 states are analyzed. Results: Six CFAI-A subscales were identified, and internal consistency reliability for these subscales ranged from .64 to .95. The construct validity of all but one of these subscales is promising. Conclusions: The CFAIA shows promise for use in research and practice, where it might be used to improve decisions about how to support, monitor, and retain foster families and to match, place, and maintain foster children with foster families.

AB- Objective: This paper describes the development of a practice-based evaluation (PBE) tool that allows instructors to represent their student’s clinical performance in a way that is sufficiently authentic to resonate with both instructors and students, is psychometrically sound, and is feasible in the context of real practice. Method: A new online evaluation tool was designed to address several of the problems associated with previous methods of evaluation, and was tested on 190 field instructor–student pairs. Results: Results demonstrated feasibility of the tool, high acceptability from students and faculty, high internal consistency, and clearly reduced ceiling effect, when compared with a traditional competency-based evaluation (CBE) tool. It did, however, continue to result in a strong skew toward positive evaluation and did not increase the identification of students at risk. Conclusions: The online PBE tool demonstrates promise in redressing some of the evaluation issues posed by the previous CBE model of evaluation.

AB- Objectives: This study examines the factor structure and scale quality of data collected with the online Elementary School Success Profile (ESSP) for Teachers from a sample of teachers of 1,145 third through fifth graders. Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using Mplus and weighted least squares means and variances adjusted (WLSMV) estimation took into account the ordinal and clustered nature of the data. Models were tested on four random subsamples. Results using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation are presented for comparison. Results: A five-factor, first-order model demonstrated superior fit. Scores from the five scales demonstrated acceptable reliability. Conclusions: Results suggest the ESSP for Teachers provides school practitioners with quality data to guide intervention choices in schools. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB- [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 20(6) of Research on Social Work Practice (see record [rid]2010-21772-021[/rid]). In the original article an incorrect item was reported in Table 4. Item # 4 (Factor 3), "Male sex offenders should be punished more severely than female sex offenders" should have read "A lot of sex offenders use their victims to create pornography." Also, items 1, 4, 9, 13, 15, and 17 should be reverse scored. If you are currently using the CATSO we request that you make the necessary changes or contact the authors for the new version of the instrument. The corrected table is give in the erratum.] Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the nature of individual attitudes toward sex offenders. Because the term "sex offender" tends to evoke strong emotions, and given that open-ended self reports tend to be highly subjective, particularly in the context of such pointed terminology, this study sought to develop an attitude assessment tool that addresses specific domains found in the literature. Methods: Through a number of iterations, the Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offenders Scale was developed. Results: Exploratory and subsequent confirmatory factor analyses found a four-factor, 18-item version to best represent the domains of interest. Factor and item characteristics are reported. Conclusions: Replication and extension to other populations appears warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Method: A secondary analysis of client satisfaction data from 112 clients of an elderly case management setting was conducted. Results: This study found that the relationship between global client satisfaction and the composite of satisfaction with service elements differed significantly, depending on perceived importance of service elements. Conclusions: These results call into question the practice of simply adding or averaging scores from satisfaction items to produce global satisfaction scores without considering perceived importance of the service elements.

AB- The objective of this study was to develop a screen assessing domains in at-risk and substance-using adolescents. The Adolescent Domain Screening Inventory (ADSI) consists of four subscales: school, family, community, and individual or peer. A convenience sample of 6,661 youths was employed. Analyses included concurrent criterion validity, known instrument construct validity, convergent construct validity, cut points, and gender and race correlations. Concurrent criterion validity correlations range from r = .85 to r = .95. Correlation for known instrument validity is r = .56 and convergent construct validity is r = .49. Cut points produced positive predictive values ranging from .46 to .53. The ADSI demonstrated a general applicability across gender and race. The ADSI is an instrument demonstrating acceptable psychometric properties. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: This study describes the development and validation of a perceived social competence scale that social workers can easily use to assess children's and youth's social competence. Method: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on a calibration and a cross-validation sample of youth. Predictive validity was also established. Results: A four-item measure, labeled the Perceived Social Competence Scale (PSCS), demonstrated acceptable internal consistency and factorial validity in samples of children and youth participating in youth development programs. Additionally, tests for gender invariance indicated that the PSCS worked equally well for males and females. The PSCS also demonstrated predictive validity, correlating positively with perceived belonging. Conclusion: Support was found for the PSCS as an empirically sound tool to assess children and youth's perceptions of social competence.

AB- Objective: The Evaluation Self-Efficacy Scale (ESE) is being developed as an outcomes assessment instrument for social work courses focusing on evaluation. Method: This scale, based on social cognitive theory, was pretested, revised, and then used with a final sample of 85 master's-level students in the original study. Using a single-group, pretest-posttest retrospective design, the current study (N = 111) is a direct replication of the original ESE study. Results: In this replication, Cronbach's alphas for the ESE were .95 (pretest), .95 (posttest), and .96 (retrospective pretest). Evidence for the construct validity of the ESE is obtained. Conclusion: The results provide additional evidence supporting the psychometric properties of data obtained using the ESE, suggesting that it may be appropriate for use in educational outcomes assessment in general and accreditation-related research in particular.

AB- HIV/AIDS knowledge measures are widely used to determine the efficacy of HIV/AIDS prevention and education efforts. While much research has looked at the interventions, less attention has been paid to the quality of the measures themselves. Objectives: (a) To identify HIV/AIDS knowledge measures created for use with adults; (b) to determine the extent to which these measures have been psychometrically tested. Method: This article systematically reviews the use of psychometric testing of HIV/AIDS knowledge measures. Results: There has been minimal reliability and validity testing; of measures that had undergone some form of psychometric testing, 71% were created before the year 2000. Conclusion: More rigorous testing of these measures is critical to ensure they are appropriate for research, prevention, and practice.

Methods: Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) procedures are used to validate the APQ with 790 parents of children, ages 6-10. Results: Three subscales emerged representing parenting practices associated with child behavior management (positive reinforcement, positive discipline, and negative discipline). CFA fit indices indicated adequate fit with the model, with all items loading significantly on their respective factors. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the APQ can be used to measure parenting practices associated with child behavior management among parents of children, ages 6-10.

AB- Objectives: The Migratory Grief and Loss Questionnaire (MGLQ) was designed to measure the grief experience associated with immigration. This article reports the development and psychometric properties of a Chinese-version of MGLQ. Methods: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using maximum likelihood extraction with varimax rotation was conducted to identify the factor structure of the MGLQ. Results: A two-factor solution was identified with Factor 1 representing "Attachment to Homeland" and Factor 2 representing "Identify Discontinuity." Both factors had excellent internal consistency reliability and concurrent validity as demonstrated by predicted relationships with depression scores. Conclusions: This study supported the validity and the reliability of the MGLQ, demonstrating its utility in assessing the migratory grief experience among immigrants.

AB- Objectives: This study evaluates the utility of a new measure—the h-index—that may provide a more valid approach to evaluating journal quality in the social work profession. Method: H-index values are compared with Thomson ISI 5-year impact factors and expert opinion. Results: As hypothesized, the h-index correlates highly with ISI 5-year impact factors; but exhibits closer agreement with expert opinion, particularly with high familiarity disciplinary journals. Conclusions: This evidence of convergent and discriminatory validity suggests that the h-index may have some utility in assessing social work journals. Notable advantages of the h-index include its compatibility with the profession's applied research culture and its ability to be used with essentially all journals in which social workers publish.

AB- Reports an error in "The Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offenders Scale: The development of a psychometric assessment instrument" by Wesley T. Church II, Emily E. Wakeman, Sarah L. Miller, Carl B. Clements and Fei Sun (Research on Social Work Practice, 2008[May], Vol 18[3], 251-259). In the original article an incorrect item was reported in Table 4. Item # 4 (Factor 3), "Male sex offenders should be punished more severely than female sex offenders" should have read "A lot of sex offenders use their victims to create pornography." Also, items 1, 4, 9, 13, 15, and 17 should be reverse scored. If you are currently using the CATSO we request that you make the necessary changes or contact the authors for the new version of the instrument. The corrected table is give in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-05059-008[/rid]). Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the nature of individual attitudes toward sex offenders. Because the term "sex offender" tends to evoke strong emotions, and given that open-ended self reports tend to be highly subjective, particularly in the context of such pointed terminology, this study sought to develop an attitude assessment tool that addresses specific domains found in the literature. Methods: Through a number of iterations, the Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offenders Scale was developed. Results: Exploratory and subsequent confirmatory factor analyses found a four-factor, 18-item version to best represent the domains of interest. Factor and item characteristics are reported. Conclusions: Replication and extension to other populations appears warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The measure is titled the Cultural Receptivity in Fostering Scale (CRFS). Method: Data from 304 foster mothers who completed the CRFS and a battery of measures on psychosocial functioning are analyzed. Results: The CRFS demonstrates excellent internal consistency reliability and, to some extent, construct validity. Conclusions: The internal consistency reliability and, to some extent, validity of the CRFS is supported by these findings. The measure has potential use in facilitating socially appropriate and successful transcultural placements. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective/Method: The Sexual Abuse of Males Perceptions Scale (SAMPS) is a measure designed to assess an individual's personal and projected social perceptions of myths about the sexual abuse of boys and men. Myths are rigid, stereotypical beliefs that invalidate the experiences and minimize the profound effects of sexual abuse on boys and men. This study establishes the initial psychometric properties for the SAMPS, based on a sample of 333 students enrolled in diverse courses (i.e., business, psychology, social work, urban and regional planning, and education) at a large, southern university. Results/Conclusions: The SAMPS was developed as a three-factor instrument. Preliminary findings confirm this structure and indicate the SAMPS shows promise for future uses relating to training, research, and clinical practice.

AB- Objective: Pain assessment for nonverbal older adults with cognitive impairments or dementia presents many challenges, and it is important to determine which scales are most useful in assessing pain among this population. Method: In this review 11 observational scales for assessment of pain in older adults with dementia or cognitive impairments are evaluated in four areas: pain indicators, reliability, validity, and clinical utility of the measure. Results: Results indicate that various scales are available for assessing pain in cognitively impaired or demented older adults who are unable to report their pain, but future research should focus on further psychometric evaluations. Conclusions: Implications include that social workers should be trained as raters of pain assessment methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives. This study was designed to adapt and validate a Spanish translation of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) for the assessment of positive life changes following the stressful experiences of immigration. Method. A cross-cultural equivalence model was used to pursue semantic, content, conceptual, and technical equivalence. Translation teams and back translations were employed for semantic and content equivalence. Conceptual and technical equivalence were assessed through field-testing the reliability and factor structure of the translated PTGI in a sample of 100 Latina immigrants. Results. The translated version was highly reliable. Factor analysis failed to replicate the original five factors but the three factors identified were consistent with the conceptual underpinnings of the PTGI and another translated version. Conclusions. Semantic, content, conceptual, and technical equivalence of the Spanish version of the PTGI were supported and thus its valid use for research and practice with the study population.

AB- The reliability, validity, and factor structure of the Chinese version of the McMaster Family Assessment Device were examined in 3 studies. In Study 1, data based on 361 adolescents were examined. In Study 2, data analyzed from a clinical group and a nonclinical group (N=281 and 451, respectively) were carried out. In Study 3, data based on 3,649 secondary school students were analyzed. Findings support the internal consistency, concurrent validity, and discriminant and construct validity of the scales in different samples. In contrast to the proposal that there are 7 dimensions in the scale, 3 stable factors could be extracted from the Chinese version, and the related subscales had adequate internal consistency, temporal stability, and construct and discriminant validity in different samples. It is concluded that the Chinese device possesses good psychometric properties, although its factor structure might differ from that based on the original English version.

AB- Objective: This study tests the validity of the Rap-music Attitude and Perception (RAP) Scale, a 1-page, 24-item measure of a person's thoughts and feelings surrounding the effects and content of rap music. The RAP was designed as a rapid assessment instrument for youth programs and practitioners using rap music and hip hop culture in their work with young people, their families, and their communities. Method: The factor structure validity, criterion-related validity, and internal consistency reliability of the RAP was assessed using a convenience sample of 605 young (M=20.22 years, SD=2.8) college students. Results: Multiple groups method and structural equation modeling analyses confirmed the three-factor model (empowerment, violent-misogynistic, and artistic-esthetic) of the RAP. Reliability and criterion-related validity results were also good. Conclusions: The RAP has sound psychometric properties, and its utility as a research and assessment tool for scholars and practitioners is promising.

AB- Cultural competence has become a central social work tenet enshrined in the profession’s ethical and educational standards. Few measures of cultural competence exist, however, in spite of an increasing array of religious, ethnic, and racial groups in U.S. society. This article develops a new measure to assess cultural competence among one family of cultural groups—spiritual and religious cultures. More specifically, this scale measures respondents’ perceptions of spiritual competence at the programmatic level. To develop the eight-item scale, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with a random sample of graduate students affiliated with the National Association of Social Workers (N=303). The results suggest that the scale is a valid and reliable measure of the values dimension of spiritual competence. Although the instrument is designed to assess levels of competence in educational programs, with modification it may also be possible to use the scale in agency settings and perhaps for individual self-assessment as well.

AB- Objectives: African American urban adolescents are one of the fastest growing groups of children affected by their mother’s HIV status. These children experience HIV stigma by association with their HIV-positive mothers. Stigma may contribute to adverse outcomes for these teens. Methods: The authors describe a multistage process of scale construction, cognitive interviewing, and pilot testing to develop a measure reflecting an African American adolescent’s experience of HIV stigma when mother has HIV. Results: The resulting measure has 23 items with good reliability. An additional item suggested by qualitative data will be added to the measure and used in further testing. Conclusions: Potential uses of the measure are discussed. Intervention approaches for reducing stigma’s impact among HIV-affected African American adolescents are briefly outlined.

AB- Objective: To develop and explore the validity characteristics of a new measure of organizational culture in public child welfare agencies. Method: Multiple validation methods were used, including expert judgment and criterion-related validity procedures using a statewide sample of 1,033 child welfare caseworkers, supervisors, and administrators. Results: Principal components analyses identified seven measurement dimensions positively correlated with a criterion measure of intent to remain employed in child welfare. Regression analyses showed that four measurement dimensions accounted for 26% of the variation in the criterion measure. Conclusions: The validity evidence for this new measure supports its use in a variety of ways in child welfare practice and in continued research on organizational culture and in child welfare workforce and child outcomes research.

AB- The Life Distress Inventory (LDI) is an 18-item rapid assessment tool measuring self-reported distress across areas of social life and functioning. E. J. Thomas, M. R. Yoshioka, and R. D. Ager (1994) originally developed this measure for clinical use with spouses of problem drinkers. The present report examined its utility with a sample of healthy, nonclinical adults. An assessment of the reliability and construct validity of the LDI was conducted based on a racially diverse sample of 176 men and women (aged 18-81 yrs) drawn from a medical study of body composition. A factor analysis resulted in the development of 4 sub-scales, each with adequate internal reliability. Subscale scores correlated with convergent factors in hypothesized directions and were unrelated to discriminant factors. Finally, LDI scores for these healthy adults were compared with those from a sample of HIV positive and obese patients also participating in the research. Recommendations for clinical use and future research are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Objectives: This study presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a culturally relevant and responsive approach to screening for perinatal depression in low-income, predominantly African American women. Method: The study details the development of the community-informed instrument and subsequent evaluation of its psychometric properties relative to one specific community sample (N = 139). Results: The initial validity and reliability testing of the community-informed instrument reveal a higher internal consistency than the standardized instrument alone (alpha = .87 vs. .80). Subsequent factor analysis and inter-item correlation suggest consistency between most of the community-informed and CES-D items. Conclusions: While limited in scope to the community sample, the study reflects the perceived benefit of integrating community voice to enhance culturally relevant and empirically rigorous practice.

AB- Examined the psychometric properties of a Spanish-language version of the Client Satisfaction Inventory, including both long and short forms. Reliability and validity were examined using results from 244 clients in 6 agencies. Further tests of the short form were completed on 62 clients from 3 agencies. Findings indicate that the same items comprising the short-form English-language version can be used as a short-form of the Spanish version, that both versions have factor structures comparable to their English-language counterparts, and both have high internal consistency. Evidence of good content and criterion validity for each version was also obtained, though total scores on both versions correlated moderately with measures of depression and anxiety. Both forms appear to have acceptable measurement characteristics and perform similarly to English-language versions, except for the question of whether they measure satisfaction independently of mood states. This and possible effects of cultural differences on assessing service satisfaction are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The Circumplex Model and its accompanying measure, the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES I, II, and III), are considered one of the state-of-the-art family assessment instruments in the field. A number of concerns, however, have been raised about the validity and reliability of the previous FACES measures and their ability to assess the Circumplex Model. Limitations of previous FACES measures have resulted in the development of the FACES IV measure. J. W. Tiesel and D. H. Olson recently completed the first reliability and validity study of the FACES IV measure. This article uses data from an adolescent population (105 females aged 11-21 yrs) to further examine the psychometric properties of the new FACES IV measure. Reliability and validity analyses offer both corroborating and contradictory results when compared with the validity study conducted by Tiesel and Olson. Future directions for the development of FACES IV are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The psychometric properties of the Chinese Self-Report Family Inventory (SFI) over time were examined. The Chinese SFI was administered to 756 Chinese parents and their adolescent children (N=378) on 2 occasions separated by 1 year. The Chinese SFI was internally consistent in different samples at different times. Factor analyses revealed that 2 factors were abstracted from the scale (Family Health and Family Pathology), and they could be replicated in different samples at different times. The temporal stability of the psychometric properties of the Chinese SFI is supported by the present findings. This study demonstrates the importance of utilizing longitudinal data based on different samples to examine the psychometric properties of measures of psychosocial and family functioning in the social work context.

AB- Examined the measurement characteristics of the Multi-Problem Screening Inventory (MPSI) depression subscale. A sample of 542 responses to the MPSI was obtained from persons (aged 11-76 yrs) seeking assistance in any of several child and family service agencies. The responses on the depression subscale were analyzed using item response theory and generalizability theory methods. It was found that the MPSI depression subscale produced scores with verv desirable measurement properties for use in (1) monitoring a client's change in depression across time and (2) making tentative decisions concerning the clinical significance of a client's depression level. The measurement error characteristics of the MPSI depression subscale scores reach a minimum just below the clinical cutting point and then remain constant across the clinical cutting point and across the range of clinically significant depression levels. The results of this study suggest that the MPSI depression subscale can be used by social work practitioners to both assess and monitor their clients' problems with depression.

AB- A statewide data collection effort was implemented to assess the validity and reliability of a 52-item consumer assessment instrument of the cultural competency mental health providers. Following a 2-year, community-driven instrument development process, a consumer assessment tool was administered to 238 African American, Latino, and Vietnamese American mental health consumers across the state of Maryland. A subsequent principal components analysis indicated that 44 of the 52 items loaded on one of four factors, which accounted for 52 % of the variance in the principal components analysis. It was also found that the overall instrument had a Cronbach's alpha of.92. The authors conclude that although these findings suggest this scale has good psychometric properties and can be used as a clinical tool in the assessment of the cultural competency of mental health providers, more work is needed to fine-tune the scale.

AB- Objective: This article reports findings of three studies addressing convergent validity and test-retest reliability of the Youth Rating Scale of the Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale-Second Edition (BERS-2). Method: Pearson product-moment correlations were used in all three studies, the first two addressing convergent validity and the third addressing test-retest reliability. Results: Analysis indicated that (a) the six BERS-2 subscales and overall strength index were generally highly positively correlated with the social skills composite score from the Social Skills Rating System-Student Form (Secondary Level, Grades 7 to 12), (b) the BERS-2 subscales and strength index were generally moderately negatively correlated with the Problem scales of Achenbach's Youth Self-Report, and (c) test-retest reliability coefficients over a 1-week period were all above. 80. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the BERS-2 Youth Rating Scale has acceptable psychometric properties and may be considered for use by social work practitioners in assessment and intervention activities.

AB- This study describes the design and psychometric characteristics of the Shortform Assessment for Children (SAC). The SAC is an efficient and easy-to-use tool for monitoring the overall mental health and psychosocial functioning of children age 5 to 18 who are served by child welfare and juvenile justice systems. The one-page 48-item instrument was developed with the support of the National Institute of Mental Health to describe internalizing (withdrawn, anxious, depressed) and externalizing (aggressive, antisocial, violent) profiles of children in both home/residential and school/classroom settings. Psychometric data supporting the reliability and validity of the SAC are presented for a sample of 3,790 children served by one state's child welfare and juvenile justice system.

AB- D. Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (LSI) is a very popular assessment tool despite compelling arguments against its use. Provided is a summary of the salient issues concerning the LSI. Arguments against its use, including suspect methodology, misapplication of statistical procedures, logical inconsistencies in theory construction, and a general lack of support for reliability and validity are examined. In addition, current research studies supporting its continued popularity are presented. The authors conclude that it is important for social work researchers, educators, and practitioners to examine the psychometric properties of any instrument prior to making decisions based on unsubstantiated findings.

A probability sample of 225 licensed social workers in Maryland completed the mailed survey. The findings support a six independent factor model. Results also support the EPS-M as a valid and reliable measure for identifying motivational orientations of social workers who pursue continuing professional education. Professional knowledge was the most frequently reported motivational orientation. Implications regarding social workers' motivational orientations and the design of continuing professional education activities are discussed.

AB- Objective: The study examined the factorial validity of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) for social work research and practice. Method: Factor structure and longitudinal invariance of the MBI were tested using structural equation modeling techniques with a random sample of 475 state-registered social workers in California. Results: The original three-factor model was superior over other competing factor models. Investigation of the second-order factor model supported the presence of the common burnout factor and indicated depersonalization and emotional exhaustion were core components of burnout. Longitudinal factorial invariance was not achieved for personal accomplishment. Conclusion: The findings suggest the applicability of the MBI in a longitudinal research with careful inference regarding personal accomplishment and highlight the importance of depersonalization in social worker burnout.

Method: The sample consisted of 1,166 individuals diagnosed with severe and persistent mental illness who were receiving treatment in community-based mental health programs. Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis was used to test measurement invariance of the BSI's second-order factor model across three ethnic groups (African Americans, Caucasians, and Latinos). Results: The data supported the configural invariance of the BSI's second-order factor model as well as the full metric invariance and the partial metric invariance. Conclusions: The present study presented substantial empirical evidence for the construct validity of the BSI's second-order factor model across the three ethnic groups.

AB- This article reports on the initial validation of the Fatherhood Scale (FS), a 64-item instrument designed to measure the type of relationship a male adult had with his father while growing up. The FS was validated using a convenience sample of 311 males. The assessment packet contained a demographic form, the Conflict Tactics Scale (2), Self-Esteem Scale, and the Fatherhood Scale. A series of factor analysis resulted in 13 factors accounting for 75% of the variance. Factors with high correlations that were theoretically related to other factors were combined resulting in nine subscales measuring positive and negative paternal engagement, fatherhood roles, and paternal emotional responsiveness. The subscales attained high levels of internal consistency reliability, with alpha levels ranging from 0.80 to 0.96. The scale has an overall reliability of 0.98, and showed preliminary evidence of differentiating between groups of men on self-esteem and intimate partner violence. The FS is a new assessment tool designed for use by social work practitioners and researchers to assess an individual's relationship with his father.

Method: The sample included 387 South Korean family caregivers for their older family members with disabilities. Results: The internal consistency of the IFCEA was very good, and claims for the construct validity were demonstrated. Accordingly, the confirmatory factor analysis of the IFCEA confirmed that the scale had two factors: emotional abuse and physical abuse. Conclusion: The IFCEA can be used by professionals to measure caregivers' impulses to commit elder abuse as an early assessment in the caregiving relationship.

Methods: Participants completed the Satisfaction With Life (SWL) scale at entry to community-based mental health services and again at 6 and 12 months. Five types of measurement invariance were tested using a series of multiple-group confirmatory factor analyses. Results: All five types of longitudinal invariance were supported. Conclusions: These findings offer strong support for the validity of the SWL scale as a tool for research or for clinical purposes to assess the effectiveness of interventions over time. Implications for use of the SWL scale in evidence-based social work practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Assessed the psychometric qualities of the Cognitions and Behaviors Scale (CABS) using a clinical sample of 148 adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuse (mean age 35.3 yrs). The CABS and other standardized measures, along with a demographic questionnaire, were completed by 148 adult female clients seeking counseling services at an agency that specializes in treating survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Data from the present clinical sample suggests that the CABS has strong internal consistency as well as strong concurrent validity. The mean scores of participants in the clinical sample were significantly higher than two subgroups of the norming sample. The results suggest that the CABS can be validly and reliably used in a clinical setting with adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Additional data should be obtained to further assess its test-retest reliability and its efficacy as an outcome measure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Objective: Confirm the factor structure of the original 18-item Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) as well as two abbreviated versions in a sample of mothers with a child in mental health treatment. Method: The factor structure, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of the MOS-SSS were assessed using a convenience sample of 330 mothers. Results: A 12-item version that included subscales and a 4-item version maintained a good fit. Conclusion: 12- and 4-item versions of the MOS-SSS are psychometrically sound social support instruments and are appropriate for clinical and research uses. Given the diverse populations that social work serves, confirming instruments in various samples is important to legitimize an instrument's use and advance the evidence base for support interventions.

AB- Reports the development of the Chinese Drug Involvement Scale for use in Chinese communities. A battery of scales, including the Chinese Drug Involvement Scale and 3 mental health measures, were administered to 152 students (aged 12-18 yrs). Reliability and validity analyses were performed. The refined version was then cross-validated on a group of identified drug abusers (N=77; aged 19-69 yrs). The final version of the Chinese Drug Involvement Scale is a 22-item scale. Validation results demonstrate that the Chinese Drug Involvement Scale had high reliability and a satisfactory level of validity. It is concluded that the Chinese Drug Involvement Scale is a global assessment of an individual's beliefs and values relating to drug use, apart from actual drug abuse behavior. The scale will be particularly useful for periodic assessments or outcome evaluation in treatment programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Objective: Assessing the achievement of social work educational outcomes is a requirement of the Council on Social Work Education's Educational Policy and Standards (EPAS). The Evaluation Self-Efficacy Scale (ESE) was created to assess student progress in advanced concentration courses focused on evaluation and thereby provide data regarding attainment of EPAS-related objectives. Method: This social cognitive theory-derived scale was pretested, revised, and then used with a final sample of 85 master's-level students in a single-group, pretest-posttest-retrospective pretest study. Results: Cronbach alphas for the ESE were .94 or greater. Evidence of both content and construct validity was obtained. Conclusion: The results provide evidence that supports the psychometric properties of data obtained using the ESE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- A conceptually based assessment scale was developed for use with adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). A convenience sample of 287 university students (mean age 29.4 yrs) completed a demographic survey and responded to a pool of items using a Likert-type scale. The main form of analysis is factor analysis, reliability and validity analyses, and t tests. The analysis resulted in a valid and reliable multidimensional scale that is conceptually based. Hypotheses that survivors of CSA would score significantly higher than nonsurvivors and that female and male survivors of CSA would not have significant differences in subscale and total scale scores were supported. It is concluded that the scale reported here should be tested with known groups to further establish its validity and usefulness in the clinical assessment and intervention process of adult survivors of CSA.

AB- The Lesbian Partner Abuse Scale-Revised (LE-PAS-R) was designed and construct validated to assess power imbalance between lesbian couples resulting in partner abuse. Implementing a nationwide survey using convenience sampling, an assessment packet containing the LE-PAS, two established scales (the Index of Self-Esteem and the General Contentment Scale), and demographic information was completed by 45 abused (mean age 37 yrs) and 33 nonabused lesbians. A series of factor analyses resulted in 6 factors (communication and social skills, substance abuse, intergenerational transmission of violence, fakes illness, internalized homophobia, and status differentials) accounting for 77.3% of all item variance. The 25-item LE-PAS-R shows evidence of strong reliability, credible concurrent validity, and the ability to differentiate between abused and nonabused lesbians. Further validation of the LE-PAS-R will provide evidence of its ability to assist clinicians in identifying lesbian relationships in which power imbalance may result in partner abuse.

Method: Exploratory analyses were followed by confirmatory factor analyses, and then correlations of scale scores with theoretically related variables were computed. Results: Findings favored a unidimensional scale with high internal consistency (with as few as two and as many as five items). Scale scores were generally related to other constructs as expected. Conclusions: The items show evidence of reliability and validity. In addition to the items' use in peer group research, the findings have implications for practice in terms of group leader training and facilitation, and the items' use as assessment tools.

AB- The Brief Adult Assessment Scale (BAAS) is a multidimensional assessment scale designed for use by practitioners and researchers that measures the severity of client problems in 16 areas of adult personal and social functioning. This article describes the BAAS; provides information about its administration, scoring, and interpretation; and reports findings with regard to the psychometric characteristics of the scale. Data from 291 adult participants were collected and used to assess the scale's psychometric properties. Findings suggest that the BAAS has strong internal consistency, good factorial and content validities, and preliminary construct validity. Although further research must examine the scale's known-groups concurrent validity and clinical cutting scores, the BAAS appears to be appropriate for use by social workers as an aid to diagnosis, treatment planning, and evaluation.

AB- Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and validate the Chinese Making Sense of Adversity Scale (CMSAS) to measure the cognitive coping strategies that Chinese people adopt to make sense of adversity. Method: A 12-item CMSAS was developed by in-depth interview and item analysis. The scale was validated with a sample of 627 Chinese international students in Australia and Mainland Chinese students in Hong Kong. Results: Exploratory factor analysis identified two factors: making positive sense and making negative sense of adversity. The CMSAS exhibited high internal consistency reliability and good concurrent validity. Conclusion: The CMSAS is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring the coping strategies used by Chinese people to make sense of adversity. However, further validation of the scale is needed.

AB- Two studies evaluated the validity and reliability of the Daily Living Activities Scale (DLA), a 20-item functional assessment measure for adults with severe mental disorders. The first study evaluated the internal consistency and interrater reliability of the DLA scoring for 85 clients (average age 42 yrs) with severe mental disorders currently receiving services from one of five different treatment programs. In the second study, symptomatology and functional assessment data were collected for 886 clients (average age 47 yrs) at time of admission to three different levels of care in community treatment and support services and at the time of 6-month progress reviews. Internal consistency and interrater reliability were adequate. Criterion- related validity was evidenced by the ability of DLA scores to differentiate consumers in different levels of care and by diagnostic categories. Study findings provide evidence of the usefulness of the DLA to support the functional assessment data needs of service providers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- validity & reliability & cultural sensitivity of Homesickness and Contentment Scale as measure of emotional adjustment to culture shock
KP- Chinese & Korean college students
SU- Asians; Cultural Sensitivity; Emotional Adjustment; Homesickness; Rating Scales
AB- This article reports the validity and reliability of the Homesickness and Contentment (HC) scale. The HC scale is a 20-item scale that evolved from a 30-item Homesickness, Loneliness, and Depression scale. The HC scale is intended to be culturally sensitive to an Asian population in measuring emotional and psychological adjustment to a new culture. Unlike other measures of adjustment developed for and tested on Western samples, the HC scale takes into account the private nature of Asians when examining symptoms of homesickness and contentment. Data collected from 201 Chinese and Korean graduate students and spouses in an American university were used for various psychometric tests. Overall, the HC scale showed excellent subscale reliability, high global reliability, high face and factorial validities, and preliminary construct validity. Discussions on validity, reliability, and utility are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives: (a) to continue the development of a measure of human caring in the context of social work practice and (b) to expand a line of inquiry exploring the relationship between human caring characteristics and the retention of public child welfare workers. Methodology: Surveys were received from a sample (n = 786) child welfare workers in Georgia engaged in the delivery of direct services. Results: Principal components and alpha reliability analyses supported the multidimensionality of the human caring construct and measurement reliability for the sample. Additional validity evidence documented positive relationships between human caring and child welfare staffs' intentions to remain employed in child welfare. Conclusions: The quantitative measure of human caring can be used in a variety of ways in social work practice (e.g., employee selection) and in future research that extends the human caring line of inquiry.

AB- This article challenges Perry's research (see record [rid]2006-07436-003[/rid]) using performance evaluations to determine whether the educational background of child welfare workers is predictive of performance. Institutional theory, an understanding of street-level bureaucracies, and evaluations of field education performance measures are offered as necessary frameworks for Perry's findings. Performance evaluations are insufficient absent a discussion of the link between organizational goals, supervisor training, practice protocols, and performance measurement tools. Three questions inform this critique and examples from child welfare practice illustrate the ways performance measures in this study may actually be a measure of organizational stasis and pressure to conform to practice as it has been.

AB- This study represents an initial step at giving social work practitioners an important assessment tool as they seek to provide culturally competent services to Native American clients. For the current study, a spiritual lifemap assessment tool was modified by the authors for a Native American cultural context. To determine the relevancy and consistency of utilizing the modified assessment tool with Native American clients, 50 Native American experts reviewed, rated, and gave feedback on its use. Results showed that spiritual lifemaps were generally consistent with Native American culture and, if used properly, could be very beneficial in working with Native Americans.

AB- Objective: The present study has two goals: to assess the difference between secondary trauma and job burnout and to examine the utility of secondary trauma in predicting psychological distress. Method: The data come from a survey of social workers (N = 236) living in New York City 20 months following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC). Results: Social workers' involvement in WTC recovery efforts is related to secondary trauma but not burnout. Analyses also reveal that both secondary trauma and burnout are related to psychological distress after controlling for other risk factors. Conclusion: This study supports the importance of compassion fatigue as a risk factor for social workers counseling traumatized clients and its association with psychological problems.

AB- Objective: Bibliometrics is a method of examining scholarly communications. Concerns regarding the use of bibliometrics in general, and the impact factor score (IFS) in particular, have been discussed across disciplines including social work. Although there are frequent mentions in the literature of the IFS as an indicator of the impact or quality of scholars' work, little empirical work has been published regarding the validity of such use. Method: A proportionate, stratified, random sample, of n = 323 articles was selected from 17 Web of Science listed social work journals published during the 1992 to 1994 period. Results: The relationship between journals' IFSs and the actual impact of articles published in those journals (predictive validity) was r = .41 (short term) and r = .42 (long term). Conclusion: The practice of using the IFS as a proxy indicator of article impact merits significant concern as well as further empirical investigation.

AB- Objective: Interview data collected from 275 clients with severe mental illnesses are used to test the construct and criterion validity of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptom Scale (PSS). Method: First, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are used to test whether the scale reflects the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed., text rev. (DSM-IV-TR). Second, structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to test concurrent validity. Results: A 2-factor PSS reveals an excellent fit to the data, and SEM shows good concurrent validity with key study variables. Conclusion: The PSS reveals a 2-factor structure (Re-experiencing and Avoidance) in this particular sample, and stress from high-risk behaviors and drinking to cope with negative emotions mediate the relationship between subjective distress from trauma and PTSD symptoms.

AB- The Professional Opinion Scale (POS) was developed to measure social work values orientation. Objective: A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on the POS. Method: This cross-sectional study used a mailed survey design with a national random (simple) sample of members of the National Association of Social Workers. Results: The study validated a 28-item POS retaining the four subscales described by Abbott, and the model fit was acceptable. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the POS may be useful in assessing social work values across the social work profession.

AB- Objective: To test the original factor structure of the Theoretical Evaluation Self Test (TEST) and to assess alternate factor structures. TEST includes the major psychotherapy theories (cognitive-behavioral, family, humanistic, and psychodynamic), ecosystemic and pragmatic approaches, and a cultural competency orientation. Method: Composing the replication sample are 146 MSW students and 32 practicing clinicians. Some analyses also include a previously collected sample (n = 130). Results: Five of the six original subscales are replicated by exploratory factor analysis and by assessing factor congruence. A four-factor solution is a better fit in confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusions: The six-factor solution, with its traditional theoretical divisions, is recommended for use as a self-scoring educational tool. However, the statistically stronger four-factor solution is preferable for research applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Method: Researchers interviewed 285 adult women who had received domestic violence services, were currently incarcerated, or were residing in the community. Results: Five subtypes of informal economic activity are identified: (a) informal selling and exchange, (b) credit card use, (c) institutionalized informal economy, (d) gifts or loans from family and partners, and (e) illegal informal economy. Strong evidence is found for reliability and validity. Conclusions: This scale can be used to expand the knowledge base of practitioners and policy makers about the strengths and economic coping strategies of low-income individuals.

AB- Objective: To determine the concordance between the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) in diagnosing anxiety and depressive disorders. Method: Fifty women seeking psychiatric services for their children at two mental health centers in western Pennsylvania were assessed for anxiety and depressive disorders using the SCID and the PHQ. Results: Twenty-five women met SCID criteria for at least one anxiety disorder, 11 (44%) of whom the PHQ failed to identify. The PHQ was particularly limited in identifying individuals with anxiety disorders other than panic disorder. Seventeen women met SCID criteria for at least one depressive disorder, 6 (35%) of whom the PHQ failed to identify. The PHQ was particularly limited in identifying depressed individuals with dysthymia. Conclusions: Caution should be used when screening for anxiety and depression with the PHQ. Implications for improving diagnostic accuracy in social work practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Conducted validation research on a new short-form (25 item) scale, the Index of Alcohol Involvement (IAI), that was designed to measure the degree or magnitude of alcohol abuse. A convenience sample of 305 undergraduates completed a short background questionnaire and 9 short-form scales, including the IAI. Findings suggest that the IAI is unidimensional, has reliability (based on internal consistency measures), and has a low standard error of measurement. Initial evidence suggests the presence of construct validity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Objective: This article discusses continued development of the Urban Hassles Index (UHI). The stressors identified in the UHI are chronic and differ substantively from the more acute life events indexes typically employed to measure adolescent stress. Method: Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the underlying factor structure of the UHI. Structural equation modeling was used to define the relationship between the latent factors and the observed variables and to test, a priori, the hypothesis that responses to the UHI could be explained by four first-order factors. Results: For study participants, urban hassles include four dimensions (harassment, anxiety, social disorganization, and coercion). However, the hypothesis that responses to the UHI could be explained by four first-order factors and one second-order factor could not be confirmed. Conclusions: The utility of the UHI for social work researchers and practitioners is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives: Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (C-IRI) for the assessment of empathy in Chinese people were examined. Method: The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was translated to Chinese, and an expert panel reviewed its content validity and cultural relevance. The translated instrument (C-IRI) was administered to 189 junior high school students and 391 university students. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a stable hierarchical three-factor structure that was consistent with structure of the English IRI, but the cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy were combined to form a new factor. The subscales of the CIRI demonstrated acceptable to good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Some evidence for the construct validity of the measure was also found. Conclusions: The C-IRI possessed acceptable psychometric properties in Chinese adolescent samples. The present findings suggest that the cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy are not differentiated in Chinese adolescents.

AB- Describes the development and validation of a bilingual instrument to measure Spanish-speaking clients' perceptions of social worker interventions in prenatal care programs. Using the Likert scaling method, the instrument that was constructed consists of 4 subdimensions: attitudes (1) toward prenatal care services in general, (2) toward the institution providing these services, (3) toward the social work profession in general, and (4) toward the social work services received in the prenatal care programs. 187 pregnant women whose 1st language was Spanish completed the instrument; data were collected in 8 pretesting and field-testing prenatal care programs in Puerto Rico. The 1st 3 dimensions were considered as possible influences that could affect or be affected by the Ss' perceptions on the 4th and main dimension of concern.

AB- Objective: This article describes the development and initial validation of the 90-item Chinese Positive Youth Development Scale (CPYDS), which contains items related to 15 aspects of positive youth development. Method: Adolescents with well adjustment (N = 162) and poor adjustment (N = 160) responded to the CPYDS. Results: The findings showed that the CPYDS measures possess acceptable internal consistency and were able to discriminate the two groups. Although the CPYDS measures were positively related to thriving, life satisfaction, and perceived academic achievement, they were negatively related to substance abuse, delinquency, and behavioral intention to engage in problem behavior. Conclusions: The CPYDS can be used as a global measure of positive youth development in Chinese adolescents, but its dimensionality and subscales should be further examined.

AB- There are a number of challenges facing those who set out to conduct systematic reviews of intervention effects in the social sciences. These challenges include formulation of a review problem, gathering data about relevant studies and outcomes, analyzing that data, and interpreting the results. The first challenge, formulating a workable review problem, includes three subchallenges: delimiting interventions, specifying the intervention targets including problems and populations, and choosing outcome measures. This article examines the challenge of how to choose outcome measures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Individuals with DSM-IV Cluster B personality disorders are at particular risk of violence toward self or others. Emotional dysregulation is likely to be a factor in such incidents and is a central issue addressed in therapies with personality-disordered individuals. This article reports findings from a study that developed an original 18-item measure of emotional dysregulation and administered the scale to 100 participants diagnosed with Cluster B personality disorders or traits. A 13-item scale (the General Emotional Dysregulation Measure or GEDM) reflecting general emotional arousal and dysregulation of negative affect was derived using principal components analysis. The GEDM demonstrates good reliability and validity and correlates significantly with other established measures of affect. This measure is seen as potentially useful in clinical social work practice and in future investigations of the relationships among emotional dysregulation, personality disorders, substance abuse, and violence.

AB- A study was conducted to test the hypothesis that scores from a self-anchored scale for depression function as unidimensional indicators of depression and that scores from a self-anchored scale for self-esteem function as unidimensional indicators of self-esteem. A total of 228 responses were obtained from a purposive sample of clinical and nonclinical respondents. The research hypothesis implied a measurement model that was tested using structural equation modeling methods. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that scores from the self-anchored scale for depression serve as indicators of the construct depression but not with the scores from the self-anchored scale for self-esteem functioning as indicators of the construct self-esteem. The results suggested that self-anchored scales may be used to measure depression but not self-esteem. A number of practice applications of these results are discussed, including the possible use of multi-item self-anchored scales.

AB- Notes that in this age of accountability, social work practitioners face greater demands to demonstrate the effectiveness of their interventions. A practical way to accomplish this is to use rapid assessment instruments (RAIs) to measure a client's level of functioning so that any subsequent change in functioning can be accurately detected over time. This first article in this 2-part series (see record [rid]2002-13005-005[/rid]) outlined how to conceptualize and create an RAI, and how to plan and subsequently implement a design testing the newly created scale's psychometric properties, laying the ground work for Part 2 of this series. The purpose of this article is to further develop the foundations that were introduced in Part 1 by using the authors' own works to illustrate how to develop a new scale and test its psychometric properties. Decision-making strategies and standards for how to interpret scale psychometrics are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Rating Scales; Social Perception; Social Support; Test Construction
AB- The measurement of the concept of social support is critical to researchers interested in examining the role that support plays in the development and treatment of mental health problems. This article presents a new scale for measuring this concept, the Scales of Perceived Social Support (SPSS), and evaluates some of its important psychometric properties. A total of 363 16–84 yr olds participated. The scales were found to have good internal consistency and good test-retest reliability. In terms of validity, the scales correlated well with an established support measure. Factor analyses provided corroborating evidence for the scales' two, main dimensions, namely support from family and from friends. Further study is required to assess the potential utility of the scales for single case research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- In this age of accountability, social work practitioners face greater demands to demonstrate the effectiveness of their interventions. A practical way to accomplish this is to use rapid assessment instruments (RAIs) to measure a client's level of functioning so that any subsequent change in functioning can be accurately detected over time. Although great strides have been made during the past three decades in the development of RAIs, there remains a paucity of reliable and valid scales when compared to the increasingly complex range of problems that practitioners confront in their day-to-day work with clients. This article, the first in a two-part series, outlines how to conceptualize and create a scale and how to plan and subsequently implement a design testing the newly created scale's reliability and validity. The second article in this series provides illustrations of these steps from the authors' own works, detailing decision making and strategies for analyzing psychometric data.

AB- Extending the Social Health Profile and other instruments that measure problem behavior in childhood, the Carolina Child Checklist (CCC) was developed to measure risk and protective factors related to aggressive behavior in children ages 6-12 yrs. This study reports the psychometric properties of the CCC. The measure's dimensionality, reliability (internal consistency and test-retest), standard error of measurement, and validity (convergent, concurrent, treatment sensitivity) were evaluated in a project involving 171 sixth-grade students (mean age 11.8 yrs). Factor analysis indicated 4 dimensions called Learning Orientation (behaviors and attributes related to classroom success), Relational Aggression, Social Involvement, and Physical Aggression. The measure has high internal consistency with low measurement error. Test-retest findings suggest a stable measure. The CCC has good convergent and concurrent validity and appears sensitive to treatment effects. The CCC is a promising measure for social workers assessing risk and protective factors related to childhood aggression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study used the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) to examine the level of consumer satisfaction with children's (ages 8 to 17 years) outpatient mental health services. Analyses were completed using both individual satisfaction items and a summed scale score. The CSQ scale had satisfactory internal consistency reliability for both mothers (alpha=.96) and children (alpha=.93). Parents' ratings of satisfaction with their child's treatment were not uniformly consistent with those of the child who was in treatment. Mothers' and children's ratings were significantly, but only moderately, related. We also found that a child's satisfaction with outpatient services, relative to that of the parent, may depend on the child's gender, race, and age. These findings suggest that children's satisfaction with mental health treatment was complexly determined and should not be inferred from their mothers' degree of satisfaction.

The three newly identified subscales were found to have convergent validity with social support as expected. Overall, older adults were found to have higher, but nonsignificant scores on the Blaming subscale, whereas those 20 to 39 years old had significantly higher scores related to discrimination. The 13-item HIV stigma scale can discriminate experiences of stigma in older adults and support three subscales while maintaining internal consistency.

AB- Developed a 34-item scale for the assessment of relative perceptions of personal and professional power or empowerment among social work practitioners. The scale was constructed using a modified empirical approach. Item selection was initially guided by theoretical literature, and then a 3-phase process was used to refine the scale and ensure validity and reliability. A prepilot panel of 24 social workers, a pilot sample of 62 professionals and students, and a random sample of 520 social workers participated in developing and testing the instrument. The final shortened form is described as a relatively sound measure for tapping the dimensions of empowerment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Studied the construct validity of a self-anchored scale designed to measure self-esteem. The scores on the self-anchored scale were correlated with scores from 2 standardized self-esteem scales, a depression scale, and several demographic variables. 235 Ss (mean age 32.8 yrs) participated in the study. The results indicate some degree of convergent validity and discriminant validity for the self-anchored scores, but they also suggest that an S's self-reporting of sense of self-esteem on a self-anchored scale may be highly influenced by his or her level of depression.

AB- Objective: This article reports the validation of the Caregiver Role Identity Scale, designed to measure the prominence of helping professionals' identity as personal and professional caregivers. The authors developed the measure to test its application to burnout, depression, and professional impairment among social workers. Method: Data from a probability sample of 751 practicing social workers were collected in an anonymous survey about social workers' health and work issues. The authors split the sample to conduct exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Results: The exploratory analysis demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, good content validity, and preliminary discriminant validity. The confirmatory analysis demonstrated excellent factorial validity for a revised scale, retaining reliability and demonstrating convergent validity. Caregiver role identity was related to burnout, depression, professional impairment, and not seeking help for personal problems. Conclusions: This scale may be a useful tool for early identification, prevention, and intervention strategies for impairment among social workers.

AB- The current study of 389 university freshman cited by the administration for underaged drinking examines gender and three drinking contexts (i.e., convivial, intimate, and negative coping) as differential predictors of personal problems (e.g., depressed, nervous) and social problems (e.g., unplanned sex, drove under the influence) that respondents attribute to their own alcohol use. Results demonstrated that more than one third of these respondents reported at least one personal problem, which they attributed to the use of alcohol in the previous year, and about half reported at least one social problem. However, when logistic regression was employed, results showed that drinking to cope with negative emotions was the only independent predictor of personal drinking-related problems. Drinking excessively in convivial circumstances, intimate encounters, drinking to cope with negative emotions, and being male were all independently predictive of social problems related to alcohol abuse. Implications for assessment and early intervention strategies are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Examined a confirmatory factor analysis of the internal structure of the Practice Skills Inventory (PSI) and assessed reliability and criterion validity of the subscales. The study used a combined survey sample of social work master's students and experienced practitioners (N=566; mean age 36.9 yrs) who responded to the 75-item questionnaire. A 3-factor model measuring supportive, therapeutic coping, and case management skills significantly fits the data (based on several fit indices) with high factor loadings and good reliability ratings. Subscales also predicted the level of social work practice experience. The authors conclude that the PSI demonstrates adequate factorial validity and internal consistency and provides a practical tool to further study the utilization of social work practice skills.

AB- The authors report on the development and initial validation of two brief measures of children's posttraumatic symptoms: a child self-report and a parent report. Intended applications include postdisaster screening, tracking children's recovery in research and clinical settings, and screening for posttraumatic stress among children with various presenting problems. A sample of 206 urban and rural school children, Grades 3 through 8, and their parents, completed these measures as well as a checklist of the child's trauma-loss history. Findings provide preliminary support for the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, content validity, and criterion validity of each measure. We recommend cautious use of the measures, and suggest additional avenues of study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- A study was conducted to assess the equivalence of validity and reliability of two forms of the Self-Esteem Rating Scale. A total of 228 responses were obtained from a purposive sample. Several data analysis methods were used to test specific hypotheses, and two methods of equating observed scores on the two forms were used. The results were consistent with the general hypothesis of equivalence of validity and reliability. Equipercentile and linear equating methods produced nearly the same results in terms of equivalent scores between the two forms. The results suggested that the two forms of the Self-Esteem Rating Scale produce scores with a practical level of equal validity and reliability, that the two forms may be used interchangeably in social work practice, and that the equating formula may be used to convert a score from one form to an equivalent score on the other form.

AB- Reports on the development and validation of the Corporate Behavioral Wellness Inventory (CBWSI), specifically designed for use by social workers in occupational social work. 1,040 employees (aged 18–68 yrs) from different organizations in South Africa were subjected to the original validation research done on the CBWSI. The results clearly indicate that the different subscales on the CBWSI have good reliability, that the scale is strong enough in terms of its measurement error characteristics to recommend it for use in occupational settings, and that the CBWSI appears to be acceptable in terms of its content and construct validity. The CBWSI is a new assessment tool specifically designed for social workers in occupational practice settings, that can be recommended to serve as a tool for assessing diverse employee strengths or to use as part of service delivery to employees.

AB- This article describes the development and validation of the Willingness to Care Scale (N. Abell, 1999), a multifactorial measure assessing the experiences of informal caregivers for persons living with AIDS (PLAs). Willingness to care describes one's attitude toward providing emotional, instrumental, and nursing support. Interviews were conducted with 155 caregivers of PLAs on caregiving and psychosocial concerns. Strong evidence was found for factorial and content validity and reliability. The tool may be used by social workers to assess the potential for and monitor the functioning of task-focused caregiving relationships. Issues in sampling for HIV/AIDS research are discussed.

AB- This study was intended to validate a Spanish adaptation of the Multi-Problem Screening Inventory (MPSI), which was developed by W. W. Hudson and S. L. McMurtry for assessment in social work practice. Research was based on the cross-cultural equivalence model and included a content judgment study followed by a field test with a sample of 313 Puerto Rican university students (mean age 26.9 yrs). The findings regarding internal consistency as well as item, factorial, discriminant, and convergent analyses of the Spanish MPSI were similar to those of the English version; items were found to be relevant for Puerto Ricans. It is concluded that content, technical, and conceptual equivalence of the Spanish and English versions of the MPSI were supported, and thus its valid use in social work practice with the study population.

KP- development & validity of measurement of client engagement in & assessment of group work practice by social work graduate students
SU- Client Participation; Group Dynamics; Measurement; Test Construction; Test Validity
AB- This study examines the psychometric properties of a measure of client engagement for in-group work conducted by social work graduate students, the Groupwork Engagement Measure (GEM). The measure's properties were tested at two different points of group development, early and late group. The closed-ended groups were led by 13 graduate social work students and consisted of 86 student peers. The measure had excellent reliability at both administrations, with coefficient alphas of .97 and low Standard Error of Measurements. The construct- and criterion-related validity analyses were generally favorable. Conclusions: The GEM is a promising tool for social group workers interested in monitoring and improving their service. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- reliability & validity of Client Satisfaction Inventory
KP- 12–89 yr old human service clients
SU- Client Satisfaction; Inventories; Social Services; Test Reliability; Test Validity
AB- Tested the reliability and validity of the Client Satisfaction Inventory (CSI), a 25-item scale for measuring general satisfaction with services among clients of human service agencies. The CSI was administered to 329 clients (aged 12–89 yrs) of 11 agencies in 6 states. Also administered were 3 other standardized measures and a brief descriptive questionnaire, results from which were used to assess the discriminant validity of the CSI. Findings indicate that both the full version of the CSI and a 9-item short-form version (CSI-SF) have good to excellent internal consistency. Item analyses also provide some affirmative evidence with regard to the content validity of both versions, and the presence of hypothesized relationships between client satisfaction scores and those of the other instruments offer indications of good discriminant validity for each version. The authors note that accountability demands, including pressures associated with managed care, have created a need in many agencies for brief, accurate, and norm-referenced measures of client satisfaction. Although further research is needed, initial results suggest that the CSI and CSI-SF may be useful tools for meeting this need. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The Practice Skills Inventory (PSI) was developed with master of social work (MSW) students to measure the frequency with which social workers employ specific intervention strategies. Despite initial evidence of validity, reliability, and utility, further validation is needed with more experienced social workers. The current study with 281 experienced MSW practitioners (mean age 43.4 yrs) revealed three factors (Supportive, Therapeutic, and Case Management) very similar to three of the original four factors derived from the previous study. However some differences did emerge including an additional Insight factor. These four factors constituted a more parsimonious solution (23 items) than the original scale and accounted for over 60% of the variance with good to excellent internal reliabilities. Comparisons with the original version are made as well as suggestions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The reliability and factor structures of the Chinese Self-Report Family Inventory (C-SFI) are examined. The GSFI was administered to 858 Chinese parents and their 429 adolescent children. Results showed that the C-SFI is internally consistent. Contrary to the previous findings that there are five to six dimensions of the original Self-Report Family Inventory (SFI), factor analyses revealed that two stable factors (Family Health and Family Pathology) were abstracted from the C-SFI. The present data suggest that social work and clinical practitioners should be cautious in using the subscales in the SFI (particularly for Chinese people) and that they should be conscious of cultural variations in the application of family assessment tools. Further effort should be made to clarify the dimensionality of the SFI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Expanded (BPRS-E) is a widely used outcome measure that assesses change in psychiatric symptoms. The focus of the present study was to clarify and determine the factor structure of the BPRS-E with geriatric and nongeriatric psychiatric inpatients. Two previous studies found different factor structures for the BPRS-E, raising questions regarding appropriate subscore interpretations. To carry out this exploratory study, factor analyses were conducted on the BPRS-E ratings of 564 adult patients (54 geriatric and 510 nongeriatric) at a state psychiatric hospital. Obtained results suggest that there is a stable factor structure within the BPRS-E that allows for the reliable and valid interpretation of subscores for geriatric and nongeriatric psychiatric inpatients by social work researchers and treatment providers.

AB- The present study provides information on the reliability and validity of the Transracial Adoption Parenting Scale (TAPS), a multidimensional 36-item Likert-type scale that measures cultural competence among transracial adoptive (TRA) parents. The TAPS was theoretically developed and refined through feedback from experts in TRA adoption. A cross-sectional survey design was used with a national nonprobability sample of 1,411 TRA parents. Each parent completed the 53-item TAPS and three other instruments with which to examine criterion and construct validity. After a preliminary factor analysis of the 53-item TAPS, the authors found that 36 items were retained in six factors. The 36-item TAPS had excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91), concurrent and discriminant validity were supported. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the TAPS holds promise of being a psychometrically sound instrument with which to measure cultural competence among TRA parents. Further investigation is warranted.

Method: A sample of 287 licensed social workers completed a mailed survey containing the STSS and other relevant survey items. Results: Evidence was found for reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and factorial validity. Conclusions: The STSS fills a need for reliable and valid instruments specifically designed to measure the negative effects of social work practice with traumatized populations. The instrument may be used to undertake empirical investigation into the prevention and amelioration of secondary traumatic stress among social work practitioners.

AB- Employs exploratory factor analysis to evaluate the equivalence of factor structure of the short version (11 of 20 original items) of the well-known Center for Epidemiologic Studies—Depression (CES-D) Scale between Black and White women. The study used secondary data from a nationwide probability sample that included 438 young (ages 24 to 59 yrs) Black females, 652 young White females, 340 older (ages 60 or older) Black females, and 764 older White females. The study argues that if the short CES-D Scale were compatible between the age and racial subgroups, then it would have the same number of factors, similar factor loadings, and similar factor variance between the subgroups. Results revealed that the selected 11 CES-D Scale items did not have the same factor structure when compared between age groups among Black and White women. Moreover, the short version of the CES-D Scale did not have the same factor structure as the original 20-item scale. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Objective: This article reports the initial development of the Alcohol and Other Drug Self-Efficacy Scale (AODSES). Method: The scale instrument is designed to measure social workers 'perceived self-efficacy of their substance abuse knowledge and skills with MSW practitioners (N = 399). Results: Factor analysis revealed six subscale factors in the initial scale development composed of 43 items, accounting for 76% of the variance with excellent internal reliabilities. The six subgroup factors were moderately correlated. Conclusions: Given the reliability and validity of the scale, it may be useful in agency settings to evaluate and measure social workers' confidence in treating clients who have alcohol and other drug problems. Replication of the study is a necessary next step with another group of social workers for further external and internal validation.

KP- development & factor analysis & reliability & validity of Helping Relationship Inventory
KP- family service clients & their social workers
SU- Factor Analysis; Inventories; Social Casework; Test Construction; Therapeutic Alliance
AB- Report the development of an instrument to assess the strength of the helping relationship in social work. The Helping Relationship Inventory has both client (HRI:C) and worker (HRI:W) versions. The HRI:C is composed of items that capture those aspects of the helping relationship that are most salient to clients. The HRI:W is composed of items that capture those aspects of the helping relationship that are most salient to workers providing help. The data were obtained from a study of 42 family service clients and their social workers. In addition to completing structural and interpersonal questions, clients also completed client satisfaction questions. Social workers completed the worker version of the structural and interpersonal questions, provided demographic information on the client and information about the client's problems and completed the short-form worker version of the Worker Alliance Inventory. Findings from factor analyses support the authors' conceptualization of social work practice as a collaborative effort involving both structural and interpersonal components. The findings also support the development of different client and worker measures. The inventory has acceptable reliability estimates and appears to have adequate validity.

AB- Objective: The objective of this study was to reaffirm, using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the four value subscales (respect for basic rights, sense of social responsibility, commitment to individual freedom, and support of self-determination) identified in the initial exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the Professional Opinion Scale (POS). Method: The CFA reported here suggests that four items included in the original POS be repositioned, and eight items be removed, resulting in a 32-item updated version of the POS. Results: A final model, incorporating correlations of disturbances or errors between four pairs of similarly worded items, resulted in the best fit model. Conclusion: Although the final CFA does not support the entirety of the four factors identified by EFA, the resulting version of the POS, supported by goodness of fit indices, does support the four value subscales with minor modifications.

AB- Objective: Existing studies of lay explanations of poverty in the social work literature are plagued with methodological problems. The psychometric properties of the 13-item Chinese Perceived Causes of Poverty Scale (CPCPS), which assessed four categories of explanations of poverty, were examined. Method: Chinese parents and their adolescent children from 229 families experiencing economic hardship were asked to respond to the CPCPS. Results: Results consistently showed that four factors were abstracted from the scale: Personal Problems, Exploitation, Lack of Opportunity, and Fate. The four related subscales were also found to be internally consistent, and there was some support for their construct validity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the CPCPS possesses sound psychometric properties. The findings also point out the importance of empirically demonstrating the existence of measures assessing different constructs when social work practitioners and researchers examine lay explanations of poverty.

AB- Reports findings from an initial evaluation of a new multidimensional assessment tool, the Multi-Problem Screening Inventory (MPSI). The inventory gathers information on 27 different areas of personal and social functioning and is designed for use by human service practitioners in a variety of settings. Ss were 311 undergraduate or masters-level social work students (mean age 32.4 yrs). Basic guidelines for using the MPSI are detailed with emphasis given to the preparation and interpretation of graphic profiles for rapid but comprehensive client assessments. Reliabilities and validities obtained for each of the subscales are then reviewed, along with suggestions for further development and use of the MPSI in clinical trials and research applications.

SU- Inventories; Social Casework; Test Construction; Test Validity; Work (Attitudes Toward)
AB- Reports the development and initial validation of the Social Work Values Inventory (SWVI). The SWVI was developed by using 6 tasks compiled from the general literature on instrumentation. They include (1) developing a definition of values, (2) using the literature to select those values to be measured by the instrument, (3) using a theory of instrument construction, (4) relating the definition of values to the actual instrument, (5) developing unambiguous stimuli, and (6) determining scaling and scoring techniques. Preliminary reliability estimates ranged from acceptable to good across 4 data collections. Examinations of content, factorial, and construct validity provided excellent support of the instrument as a valid measure of social work practice values.

SU- Occupational Choice; Questionnaires; Social Casework; Social Work Education; Test Construction
AB- Tested the Social Work Career Influence Questionnaire (SWCIQ) as a measurement tool for assessing career choice variables among master's of social work (MSW) students. A nonprobability sample of 589 students (mean age 32.1 yrs) from 6 MSW programs participated in the cross-sectional survey that included the SWCIQ. Four areas of career influence were identified using factor analytic techniques and item analysis: Personal and Family Experiences, Desire To Be a Therapist, Prestige of the Profession, and the Social Change Mission of the Profession. Aspirations for private practice were positively associated with higher scores on the Personal and Family Experiences, Desire To Be a Therapist, and Prestige subscales. High scores on the Social Change dimension resulted regardless of the students' career aspirations. Career choice is a multidimensional construct matching personal and social change values regardless of MSW students' projected practice setting.

AB- Describes a measure, PRIDE1 (Principles of Reasoning, Inference, Decision-Making and Evaluation), that assesses ability to think critically about whether to adopt a treatment method. The PRIDE1 assesses written responses to 3 questions presented after the administration of an emotional audiovisual argument. Two graduate and 3 undergraduate research methods classes completed the PRIDE1 and the Kirk-Rosenblatt Research Knowledge Scale. There was no statistically significant correlation between responses on PRIDE1 and research knowledge, as measured on the Kirk-Rosenblatt Research Knowledge Scale. Results suggest that there may be little or no association between research knowledge and ability to think critically about practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examines the validity, reliability, and utility of the South Shore Problem Inventory—Revised (SSPI—R), a multidimensional global self-report scale based on a biopsychosocial framework. Data collected from 376 clients (aged 18–72 yrs) newly admitted to an adult outpatient community mental health program were submitted to principal components analysis and varimax rotation. Three major factors emerged reflecting an underlying factor structure similar to that of the original SSPI: psychophysiological (Factor 1), community/health (Factor 2), and family pathology (Factor 3). The scale accounted for about 43% of the variance; internal consistency ratings were good to excellent; and subscale correlations showed good separation among the 3 factors. Validity, reliability, and utility are discussed, as is the use of the scale in agency-based clinical assessment and outcome evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Established content validity and reliability in assessing the restrictiveness (RES) of children's living environments and developed an instrument for measuring RES. An initial 12-person expert panel was identified to generate a description of the concept of RES and a list of possible living environment circumstances. A subsequent 64-member expert panel independently rated the RES of each living environment situation on a scale ranging from not very restrictive to very restrictive. The expert panels consisted of professionals engaged in placement planning regarding children's places of living. Test–retest reliabilities and coefficient alpha indicated the existence of a reliable and consistent assessment of RES. The process resulted in a valid, reliable, and brief instrument for rating the RES of 34 children's living environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Foster Care; Measurement; Prediction; Test Reliability; Test Validity
AB- A new measure of the potential of foster family applicants to provide quality family foster care is described and field tested in this study: the Foster Parent Potential Scale (FPPS). Prospective data from 105 foster applicant families are analyzed. Results support the internal consistency reliability of the FPPS, and for the most part its predictive, convergent, and discriminant validity. The notable exception to these results is that applicants of African American and other races had higher scores than did European American applicants, although the effect of race was small. The internal consitency, reliability and construct validity of the FPPS is supported by these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- literature review
SU- Literature Review; Measurement; Social Casework; Social Support
AB- Reviews the literature on social support (SCS) and presents the theoretical foundations and basic concepts of SCS. A framework is presented for assessing measures of SCS, and measures (e.g., social embeddedness, perceived SCS, an enacted SCS) are reviewed using the framework. The framework focuses on basic conceptualizations of SCS, the psychometric characteristics of the measures, and their clinical utility. Suggestions are made for both using and improving existing measures of SCS in social work practices. The review indicates that many measures that have acceptable reliability and validity exist to assess several different types and sources of SCS. Several of these measures have potential for clinical practice: the Family Relationships Index and the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire—Family and Friends show the most promise as rapid assessment tools for clinical practice.

AB- The internal consistency and construct validity of the North Carolina Family Assessment Scale (NCFAS) are reported. The NCFAS is an instrument designed for family assessment and outcome measurement in family preservation services and child welfare. Internal consistency data from 288 participants (mean age parents: 35-yrs-old; mean age children: 10.5-yrs old) cases were analyzed. Construct validity data from 126 participants were analyzed, comparing NCFAS scores with those of the Child Well-Being Scales, the Family Inventory of Resources for Management, and the Index of Family Relations. For the internal consistency component, 3 of 5 original factors were supported, and a 4th factor emerged. Cronbach's alpha ranged from .71 to. 94. For the construct validation component, 5 of 6 relationships were statistically supported, with concurrent validity correlations ranging from .26 to .71. The internal consistency and construct validity of the NCFAS are supported by these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- factor structure of revised Perceived Caregiver Burden Scale

SU- Asians; Caregiver Burden; Elder Care; Factor Structure; Rating Scales
AB- Attempts to empirically determine the factor structure of the original M. Stommel et al (see record [rid]1990-18099-001[/rid]) 31-item Perceived Caregiver Burden Scale (PCB). 150 caregivers who were Indian or Pakistani immigrants caring for elderly relatives were interviewed by telephone, and the data were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis. Results did not support all the 31 items in the 5-factor theoretical structure but did suggest a 13-item 3-factor model. In addition, this 3-factor version evidenced high internal consistency among the subscales. The short revised version of the PCB-13 scale is an easy-to-administer screening tool for estimating burden. Although this scale should be validated further by replication, the scale has implications for social work practitioners. Practitioners are cautioned to use PCB-13 as an assessment tool, but they can supplement the short scale with other qualitative measures to screen Indian/Pakistani caregivers until further validation studies can be conducted.

SU- Pregnancy; Rating Scales; Social Support; Socioeconomic Status; Test Validity
AB- The psychometric properties of a multidimensional measure of social support, A. Vaux's Social Support Behaviors Scale (SS-B), were evaluated. The SS-B is represented by subscales describing 5 central categories of supportive behaviors (Emotional, Socializing, Practical, Financial, and Advice/Guidance), assessed for both friends and family. The SS-B was administered to a low SES, mixed-race (19% Anglo, 37% African American, and 40% Hispanic) sample of 105 adolescents who were attending pregnancy prevention programs. A trend toward high scores, low variance, and few differences between pregnant/parenting and nonpregnant/parenting teens were found on subscale scores. Factor analyses on separate subscales showed loadings more consistently for "family" than "friends." Overall results of psychometric analysis indicate that the scale needs further work to more accurately assess the salient behavioral dimensions of social support for samples from varying racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.

AB- The Hospital Social Work Self-Efficacy Scale (HSWSE), based on A. Bandura's social cognitive theory, is intended to measure social workers' confidence regarding their ability to perform specific aspects of hospital social work. The scale was developed for a hospital-based fieldwork evaluation (L. Cuzzi et al, 1996). Results from that study provide support for the reliability and validity of the HSWSE Scale. The study reported here was an attempt to replicate those findings regarding the psychometric properties of the scale. 22 1st- and 2nd-yr social work students indicated how confident they are today in their ability to successfully perform each task. The measurement package also included a modified version of the Self Efficacy Scale (M. Sherer et al, 1983, 1982) along with the Work Environment Scale (R. Moos, 1985, 1986). The scales were used on 4 measurement occasions. Support was again found for the reliability and validity of the HSWSE Scale. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes the development of a research instrument to measure social work practice skills derived from both psychotherapy integration research and eclectic psychosocial models of social work practice. Based on data collected from 285 MSW interns (mean age 30.7 yrs) who completed the Practice Skills Inventory, results demonstrated that 4 clear factors emerged encompassing therapeutic, supportive, treatment planning/evaluation, and case management skills. The 4 factors (totaling 33 items) accounted for over 50% of the variance and showed good to excellent internal consistency ratings. Theoretical and methodological strengths and limitations of the scale are considered, and its potential implications for social work practice and education. Recommendations for further validation of the Practice Skills Inventory are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes the development of the Hospital Social Work Self-Efficacy Scale, based on A. Bandura's (1986) social cognitive theory, to be an outcome measure of social workers confidence regarding their ability to perform specific hospital social work tasks. The scale was developed during an evaluation of 2 types of social work field experience (full-year placements vs 3 sequential placements). Refinement of the scale resulted in a 39-item instrument with 5 subscales: Patient Groups, Written Communications, Team Performance, Critical Case Tasks, and Stress Management. Data supporting the reliability and validity of the scale are presented. Given continued support of its reliability and validity, the scale may have a variety of uses in studies of hospital social work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)
