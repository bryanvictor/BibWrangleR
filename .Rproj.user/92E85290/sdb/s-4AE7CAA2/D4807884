    "contents" : "##About the package\n\nThe BibWrangleR package was designed for conducting bibliometric research on scholarly articles.  The primary purpose of the package to take raw text files of bibliometric data obtained from database search aggregators such as ProQUest and transform these files into an analyzable data frame.      \n\nBibWrangleR is in beta form and currently it is only compatible for use with the EbscoHost and ProQuest database aggregators.  Within EbscoHost, BibWrangler has only been tested with the following three databases:\n\n+ PsycINFO\n+ Social Science Abstracts\n+ Social Work Abstracts\n\nGiven variations in attribute coding by database, it is not recommended that those with limited coding background use BibWrangleR with EbscoHost-hosted databases other than the three listed here.\n\n##How to use BibWrangleR\n\nThe first step in using BibWrangler is to obtain the raw text files from a database aggregator following a query with your desired search specifications.  BibWrangleR has only been tested on search queries limited to journal articles.  These files need to be exported from either EbscoHost or ProQuest and then stored in a location where R can access and read them.  Here are brief instructions for exporting your search results.\n\n###ProQuest\n\n   1.  Following your search, select the articles whose data you would like to export.\n   2.  Once all desired articles have been selected, click on the option titled \"More\".  This can    \n       be located on the right hand side of the screen, above the article results, and next to the \n       \"print\" option.\n   3.  Once the scroll down menu appears, select the \"Text only\" option. _Note:_ This is the only\n       format that is compatible with BibWrangleR.\n   4.  When the \"Export/Save\" window appears configure the settings as follows:\n       +  Output to:  **\"Text only\"**\n       +  Content: \"Citation, abstract, indexing\"\n       +  Bibliography: unchecked\n       +  Include:  all four options should be unchecked\n   5. Then click \"continue\" and the text file will be downloaded automatically.\n   6. Place the text file in a folder that contains only the text files you want to \"wrangle\" using\n      the BibWrangler function.  _Note:_ Only other ProQuest text file exports can be wrangled at \n      the same time.  Exports from EbscoHost must be processed separately.  \n\n###EbscoHost\n\n   1. Following your search, click the \"Share\" button.  This can be located on the right hand side \n      of the screen, above the first article result and next to the \"Page Options\" button.\n   2. Scroll down and select \"E-mail a link to download exported results\".\n   3. Once the \"Export Manager\" screen loads, switch the selected format under \"E-mail a link to a \n      file with citations in:\" to **\"Generic bibliographic management format\"**.  This is the only \n      format that is compatible with BibWrangleR.\n   4. Then enter your e-mail address in the field labeled \"E-mail to:\", and enter a subject line if \n      you choose, although this is optional.\n   5. Within 15 minutes an e-mail from EBSCOhost should appear in your inbox.  Open the e-mail, \n      click on the embedded link and a zip folder containing the text file will be downloaded \n      automatically.\n   6. Place the text file in a folder that contains only the text files you want to \"wrangle\" using\n      the BibWrangler function.  _Note:_ Only other EBSCOhost text file exports can be wrangled at \n      the same time.  Exports from ProQuest must be processed separately.\n\n###Loading BibWrangleR in R\n\nOnce you've exported the text file(s) from a database aggregator, you need to install BibWrangleR in R, and then load the package.  This requires that you first install the \"devtools\" package.  If you need to install the devtools package, enter the following into the R console:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\n\nThen run the following code to install and load the BibWrangleR package:\n\n**devtools::install_github(\"bryanvictor/BibWrangleR\")**\\n\n**load(BibWrangleR)**\n   \n##License\n\nThis package is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3, as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
