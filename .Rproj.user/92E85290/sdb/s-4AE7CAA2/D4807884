    "contents" : "##About the package\n\nThe BibWrangleR package was designed with bibliometric research in mind.  BibWrangleR is in beta form and is currently only compatible for use with the EbscoHost and ProQuest database aggregators.  Within EbscoHost, BibWrangler has only been tested with the following three databases:\n\n+ PsycINFO\n+ Social Science Abstracts\n+ Social Work Abstracts\n\nGiven variations in attribute coding by database, it is not recommended that those with limited coding background use BibWrangleR with EbscoHost-hosted databases other than the three listed here.\n\n##How to use BibWrangleR\n\nBibWrangleR is designed to take raw text files of bibliometric data and transform them into an analyzable data frame.  These text files must first be exported from either EbscoHost or ProQuest and then stored in a location where R can access and read them.  Here are brief instructions for exporting your search results. *Note:* All files must exported in a generic bibliographic format in order to be compatible with the BibWrangleR functions.\n\n\n##License\n\nThis package is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, version 3, as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.
