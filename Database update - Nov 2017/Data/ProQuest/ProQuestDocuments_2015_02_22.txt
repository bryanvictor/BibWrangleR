Abstract: The author explores the changing importance of marginalised lands in the face of increasing scarcity and growing population and highlights two Dalit initiatives for access and control over gairan lands, traditionally considered out of bounds for Dalits. The article also raises issues about equity and distributive justice vis a vis the denial of rights to marginalised communities and how they are defending their traditional rights with the help of Civil Society Organisations.

Abstract: The present study explores the driving forces of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and how firms across different sectors have shaped and institutionalised CSR strategies. The study aims to gain a better understanding on how corporate organisations deal with the key drivers of CSR practices and the difficulties in implementation. The results indicate that the FMCG sector is lagging behind in the implementation of CSR practices. Adapted from the source document.

Are Checks and Balances in MGNREGS Effective?

Author: Rajasekhar, D1; Devendra Babu, M; Manjula, R1 Centre for Decentralisation and Development, Institute for Social and Economic Change, Nagarabhavi, Bangalore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463023366?accountid=14925

Abstract: Elite capture is likely to occur in development schemes in societies where socioeconomic inequality is more pronounced and where people are unable to raise their voices against the powerful elite. Checks and balances are, therefore, incorporated into a development scheme such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to prevent misuse. This paper examines the extent to which these checks and balances have worked. The authors argue, that, notwithstanding checks and balances in the design of MGNREGS, the evidence shows misuse of resources in several forms and makes some suggestions towards making checks and balances effective. Adapted from the source document.

Rehabilitation of Discharged Patients from Mental Health Institutes

Author: Dravid, Mandakini11 "LeelaKunj", 36 St. Anne's Road, Bandra, Mumbai 400050 mandakdravid@gmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463034217?accountid=14925

Abstract: Mandakini Dravid has completed her post-graduation in Social Work from TISS in 1961 with specialisation in Medical and Psychiatric Social Work under Dr. Gaurirani Banerjee. She has worked as a medical social worker in Sassoon General Hospital from 1961-1985. Post retirement, she has been working as a consultant with Thermax India Ltd. She completed her Ph.D from Pune University in 2008 at the age of 81 years. Her thesis 'Medical and Psychiatric Social Work Practice-Process and Analysis' is a sum of her work as a trained social worker at Sassoon Hospital, Pune, and various other private settings. Subsequently, she published a book 'Medical and Psychiatric Social Work in Indian Settings'. This paper is based upon the author's personal experience and describes the mindset of the patients and their relatives. Relatives undergo a lot of stress and painful experiences before admitting a patient into a mental hospital. Hence, relatives are reluctant to take these patients home after discharge. Many are afraid that the patients may experience a relapse and prefer that the patients continue to stay at the hospital. At the same time, patients are also afraid to go back to their family and society. The author explains how the psychiatric social worker can help the patients and their relatives in the rehabilitation process. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article addresses a yet-to-develop, if not totally neglected domain in social work practice in Hong Kong, i. e., that of men's services. Pointing out that men's problems are a result of the "structure of gender practice" in our society, the authors advocate "gender-based practice" in addressing men's problems. They summarize a total of 11 themes in men's services, 5 of which are around directions of service development and 6 relating to strategies and skills of working with men. The article has good implications for men's services in Hong Kong. Adapted from the source document.

NGO Interventions And Women Development In Bangladesh: Do Feminist Theories Work?

Author: Hossain, Ismail1; Al-Amin; Alam, Jahangir1 Department of Social Work, Shahjalal University of Science & Technology, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554200?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reviews the extent to which feminist viewpoints are incorporated in NGO interventions aimed at women's development in Bangladesh by examining major feminist perspectives alongside NGO intervention strategies. Based on fieldwork experiences in four NGOs, it determines that NGOs are not following any specific feminist theory, but rather interventions are influenced by development paradigms engrossed in western feminist perspectives. The paper finds that third world feminism is more pertinent to the socioeconomic context of Bangladesh. However, this perspective is alone insufficient to bring desired change, rather the blending of feminist views may be more conducive to women development in Bangladesh. It concludes that the understanding of feminist theories is of greater importance for NGO practitioners and social workers to effectively address the issue of women's development.

GENERAL VALUES AND WORK VALUES OF SOCIAL WORK STUDENTS IN HONG KONG

Author: Wong, Shui-Wai1; YUEN, MANTAK1 Department of Applied Social Sciences Hong Kong Polytechnic University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1622293189?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reports research that examines general values and work values held by university students studying social work in Hong Kong. Comparison is also made with values held by similar students studying in different majors. Results indicated that social work students rated general values such as benevolence, self-direction, universalism and tradition higher than their non-social work counterparts. They also rated work values such as altruism, creativity, supervisory relations, independence and intellectual stimulation more highly. However, the social work students held lower values associated with economic returns, thus supporting a view that students with an inclination towards social work tend to espouse self-transcendence and intrinsic work values, and are less influenced by material rewards. Among the social work respondents, gender differences were found in both general and work values. Differences were also noted between the groups with different modes of study. Implications for social work education and future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Well Being Of Female Sex Workers

Author: Lakshmana, G1; Pandian, Dhanasekara1 Department of Social Work, School of Social and Behavioral Sciences Central University of Karnataka, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554204?accountid=14925

Abstract: Background: Subjective well being among female sex workers is less explored and only few studies talked about this complex issue. Aim: To study the subjective well being of female sex workers. Method: Based on the informed consent, seventy female sex workers were randomly selected from the study population. The PGI -- General Well Being scale (Verma et al., 1983) and a semi structured socio demographic schedule were used to collect the data. Results: Major findings of the study were that half of the female sex workers fall under the age group of 27 to 36, having studied up to high school (50%), majority (90%) of them being married and were using one or other substance (72.9%). Their perception of subjective well being shows that 38.6% had good positive mental health, 35.7% had moderate mental health and about one quarter (25.7%) of the respondents had low positive mental health. High subjective well being among Pre University Course (PUC) and above educated female sex workers (M=16.88, plus or minus 4.52) was noted, whereas less was noted among the group of illiterate female sex workers (M=8.96, plus or minus 5.53). Conclusion: There is a need to address female sex workers issues beyond HIV/AIDS. The current findings open up the need for appropriate interventions. Adapted from the source document.

Community Responses To Domestic Violence In China: Implications To Prevention And Intervention Work

Author: Tam, Dora M.Y.1; Dawson, Myrna; Jackson, Margret; Kwok, Siu-Ming; Thurston, Wilfreda E1 School of Social Work, King's University College, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada, N6A 2M3 dmytam@uwo.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554135?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence in marital relationships is against the law in the People's Republic of China (hereafter "China" is used), where progressive development to address domestic violence began after the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995. In this article, domestic violence is referred to as violence against women by their male partners and the complexity of domestic violence is seen to be influenced by socio-cultural, economic, psychological, and environmental factors. Community responses to domestic violence are largely led by the "residents' committees" under the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the All Women's Federation in China. However, literature has documented the inadequacy of these community responses to prevent and intervene on domestic violence. A feminist perspective is used to examine the prevalence and perception of domestic violence in the local context, and discusses implications for prevention and intervention work in China. Adapted from the source document.

RESARCH ON THE HELP SEEKING EXPERIENCES OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIMS: COMMUNITY RESPONSES AND SECONDARY VICTIMIZATION

Author: Hung, Suet-Lin11 Department of Social Work Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1622290965?accountid=14925

Abstract: This is a research brief on a qualitative study conducted from 2009 to 2010 in Hong Kong on the experiences of sexual violence victims in dealing with the various social systems and different professionals. The findings reveal that not only did the victims suffer from being sexually assaulted, they also experienced a 'secondary trauma'. Secondary victimization is most serious in schools, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the judicial system. The police, medical and social welfare systems need to be improved as well. Adapted from the source document.

Surviving Urban Displacement and Resettlement through Informal Work

Author: Vyas, Mouleshri11 Centre for Community Organisation and Development Practice, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554401?accountid=14925

Abstract: The issue of urban displacement is a vexed one. Today, it is made more complex by the multiplicity of agencies involved in project based displacement, leading to different explanations for what is clearly involuntary displacement of large sections of the urban poor from the socioeconomic fringes to physical and spatial peripheries of the city. This article examines the experience of displacement caused by infrastructure development in Mumbai city. It highlights the fact that the sustenance of formal housing that a section of the displaced population received is endangered by the displacement of informal work and livelihoods of the affected people. Adapted from the source document.

Entry into Crime and Getting Out: Male Youth involved with Criminal Gangs in Mumbai

Author: Raghavan, Vijay11 Centre for Criminology and Justice, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554185?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is based on a study of male youth arrested for extortion and other gang related crimes in Mumbai. The study explores the factors and processes, which influence the entry of these youth into crime, and the attempts made by them to get out of the criminal nexus. The article delineates factors such as the area of residence, the work place, and the prison as 'criminalising sites'; and the presence of 'manifest factors' such as conflict within the family, dropping out of school, peer influence, lifestyle problems, addictions and personality factors which initiate youth into a life of crime. The study also highlights the role that the manifest factors play in the 'getting out' process, and the role of the family, legal income, and agency, in shaping the futures of the youth. Adapted from the source document.

Advocacy Initiatives for Dalit Rights

Author: More, Santosh11 IInd Year MASW Student, School of Rural Development, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Tuljapur, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554224?accountid=14925

Abstract: The author explores the Dalit struggle for empowerment and development vis-a-vis the strategies adopted. In India, various movements and parties representing the lowest ranking dalit caste groups have employed different strategies in their struggle against social, economic and cultural discrimination. Dalit organisations are now becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of networking among themselves, which can be an effective strategy for advocacy of Dalit rights. This article highlights the use of the 'transnational advocacy network strategy' by dalit movements today for exerting pressure on decision makers, both at the national and local level. Adapted from the source document.

State, Space and Political Subjects: A Case of Special Economic Zones

Author: Jha, Manish K11 Centre for Community Organisation and Development Practice, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417523302?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper analyses the context in which Special Economic Zones are promoted as an important route to economic growth and development in India. The process for the approval of these Special Economic Zones has been expedited by various provincial governments after a hasty policy and legislative decision undertaken by the central government with severe repercussions on the lives and livelihoods of the affected people. The paper examines the basic features of the Special Economic Zone Act, the role of the government and corporate houses, and also the protest movement by political subjects against the legislative and executive initiatives undertaken by the state and its agencies. Drawing from testimonies of people, the paper examines the processes whereby state sponsored 'exceptionality' is being challenged through collective initiatives by political subjects. Adapted from the source document.

Social Welfare in East Asia after the Asian Economic Crisis: A Comparative Study on Changing Responses of Hong Kong and South Korea

Author: Panday, Pranab Kumar11 Department of Public Administration, University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524945?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the changing responses of the Hong Kong and South Korean governments towards social welfare, post the Asian Economic Crisis, 1997-98. Whereas the South Korean government considered social welfare as the main vehicle to achieve economic solvency, the Hong Kong government emphasised reforms in economic policy as a stepping stone to economic growth for the benefit of the general public. The reasons for the diverse approaches lie in the different outlooks of both the governments. The process of democratisation forced the South Korean government to take the social welfare route as a means to reduce the social costs of the crisis. On the other hand, the post colonial scenario in Hong Kong dictated the developmental measures adopted by the government. The government was of the opinion that social welfare benefits would create a culture of dependency among the general public. This article is based on secondary data. Adapted from the source document.

Thus Spake the Nicobarese

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524244?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is an analysis of the post-tsunami situation of the Nicobarese living in the Southern Group of the Nicobar Islands. The analysis is based on the narratives of various stakeholders recorded during an ethnography of Nicobarse islanders. The narratives reflect diverse arguments and perceptions of the Nicobarese, the Andaman and Nicobar Administration, and other non-Nicobarese populations regarding government intervention in the post-tsunami phase and their influence on the socio-cultural fabric of the Nicobarese. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: In 2008, the Council on Social Work Education Joint Task Force on Veterans' Affairs presented a preliminary report recommending that social work education introduce new content to provide students with an understanding of military culture and veterans' services, and to enhance their practice preparedness to work with these populations. These recommendations were subsequently formulated into advanced social work competencies in military social work. This mixed methods pilot study investigates the development of social curriculum modules utilizing distance education technology, face to face, and hybrid instruction in support of a social work curriculum initiative to address these recommendations. Modules were developed on the basis of participatory action research, two cross-sectional studies, and a systematic review of the neuroscience literature. They were pilot-tested over a three year period with social work students and licensed community practitioners and were revised each semester to reflect rapidly growing knowledge in these areas, particularly pertaining to Iraq/Afghanistan (OIF/OEF) active duty and veteran populations, as well as in response to feedback from clients, students, field instructors, and course instructors. Findings suggested that practitioners improved knowledge and skills in best practices for diagnosis and treatment of stress disorders and brain injuries, neuroscience evidence on signature injuries of current conflicts, and theory application to military/veteran cases, while undergraduate and advanced graduate students in non-Veterans Administration (VA) field placements utilized the widest variety and quantity of online material.

In Search of A New Paradigm: Social Work for Twenty-First Century Veterans

Author: Romaniuk, Jaroslaw Richard

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704237?accountid=14925

Abstract: The new generation of veterans entering the United States health care system requires institutional changes in the medical field to address these veterans' unique characteristics. Social workers must recognize how research on the mental health problems of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan may affect the process of assessment and treatment approaches. The Veterans Affairs health care system (VA) has identified relationship-based treatment as the most appropriate approach for the transformation of the VA system. This paper discusses how the latest research leads to customer-focused treatment modalities including narrative and existentialist therapies. Adapted from the source document.

Supporting the Next Surge: Helping Veterans Transition to Higher Education

Author: Gwin, David M; Selber, Katherine; Chavkin, Nancy F; Williams, Arnold

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704208?accountid=14925

Abstract: Veteran enrollment at institutions of higher education is rising as troops returning from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) take advantage of the new GI Bill. These non-traditional students face unique challenges as they transition from combat to the classroom. Higher education institutions can provide a better opportunity for their retention and academic success by creating veteran-friendly policies, programs, and services. This article examines the literature on student veterans' educational challenges and veteran-friendly campuses, describes the efforts of one university to assess the needs of student veterans, and provides recommendations for program development. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Military Cultural Awareness, Experience, Attitudes and Education on Clinician Self-Efficacy in the Treatment of Veterans

Author: Coll, Jose E; Weiss, Eugenia L; Draves, Patrick R; Dyer, Danielle L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704223?accountid=14925

Abstract: Military personnel form a fairly distinct subset of American society, governed by a distinct set of laws, norms, traditions, and values. They also face unique strains upon their mental health resultant from combat stress, the effects of multiple deployments, and the difficulties in transitioning back to civilian life (Exum & Coll, 2008; Exum, Coll & Weiss, in press). Mental health providers play an important role in facilitating the psychosocial adjustment and community reintegration of veterans, especially those with disabilities (wounded warriors). Thus the practitioners need to provide culturally sensitive services, as many previous research studies suggest that cultural competence may influence treatment outcomes (see, e.g., Sue & Sue, 2008). This study is based on a survey that was administered to mental health clinicians and master's level social work, psychology, and counseling students. The study examined clinician and student perceptions of self-efficacy in rendering mental health services to the veteran population. Analyses indicated that practitioners who identified as veterans, and as military spouses, had greater self-efficacy than those clinicians/students who did not have this experience. Also, continuing education in coursework related to military counseling improved practitioner perceptions of self-efficacy. Neither military cultural awareness nor attitudes about war had an impact on counselor self-efficacy. This study helps explain some of the influences upon clinicians' perceptions of efficacy in treating military veterans. It also provides evidence on the importance of clinicians gaining experience working with military personnel and pursuing continuing education relating to counseling service members.

Basic Training for Building a Program in Military Social Work

Author: Sable, Marjorie R; Osborne, Victoria A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704024?accountid=14925

Abstract: In response to the health and behavioral health of returning veterans, Schools of Social Work have added content to their curriculum, addressing the needs of veterans and military families. This manuscript examines existing health issues for military personnel and their families and how the University of Missouri has responded. Efforts include hosting an interdisciplinary summit for health and human services professionals, developing a graduate certificate, and holding a fund-raising event to establish a scholarship in military social work. We discuss how partnerships with the university, state and community agencies, and key individuals were essential to the success of these activities. Adapted from the source document.

Learning to Work: Young People's Social and Labour-Market Integration through Supra-Company Apprenticeship Training in Austria

Author: Haidinger, Bettina; Kasper, Ruth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417522061?accountid=14925

Abstract: The institutionalisation of supra-company apprenticeship training after its incorporation into the Vocational Education and Training Act in 2009 was a political signal to acknowledge a kind of third pillar next to school-based education and company-based apprenticeship training after compulsory schooling within the Austrian educational system. However due to the deep-rooted persistence of the dual system, it is still regarded as a "buffer" when the former fails to provide sufficient placements. As the Supra-Company-Apprenticeship Training is part of active labour market policy students are still clients of the Public Employment Service -- and not (just) young persons to be educated. Therefore, one main challenge providers of SCAT have to cope with is to prepare students on the one hand for their placement within the regular apprenticeship system and on the other hand to provide high-quality vocational training as a valuable offer. This janus-faced pedagogical treatment of students has a major impact on the students' development of capabilities for education, for work and for voice in a system with notably transitory character. This contribution will first give a short overview of the case study's institutional embeddedness. After a brief introduction into the research methods used, we will outline the key findings of the case study from a capability perspective: First, the capability approach endorses education from two perspectives: Education is a capability to be achieved as such. Education also serves as a conversion factor for other capabilities. We will present findings for these two notions, including an analysis of the (two) crucial phases for choosing the educational pathway one has reason to value and a discussion of the training's empowerment dimension in terms of 'learning (how) to work'. Second, turning to the capability for work we will on the one hand question the principal notion of work proposed by the capability approach and then lay down the youngsters' perception of 'decent work' in labour processes. Finally, we will take a look at what opportunities for voice and for being able and 'free' to choose, aspire and follow the life, work and educational pathway they have reason to value do youngsters encounter before and while participating in SCAT.

The Female Drug User as a "Victim" or "Villain" and the Implications for Social Work

Author: Frisaufova, Magda11 Masaryk University, Czech Republic

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417523459?accountid=14925

Abstract: The gender perspective in theory and research about drug use can be recognised approximately since the 1970's. It is predominantly focused on women and points them out as a specific group with specific problems and needs which have been neglected in previous research. The aim of this paper is to review the basic theoretical knowledge that we have about female drug users and discuss it in the context of social work with these women. It has been written as a part of my PhD project at the Department of Social Policy and Social Work at the Masaryk University Brno, Czech Republic and also presented at the TiSSA Preconference in August 2011. The target group of my thesis as well as this article is female 'problem drug users', who are, according to the definition by EMCDDA, 'injecting drug users or regular users of opioids, cocaine and/or amphetamines'. While critically reading and analysing the theory about female drug users we can recognise the tendency to emphasise either the role of social structure or the role of agency. This dichotomy has been reflected already by some authors, mainly criminologists and sociologists (e.g. Anderson 2008, Maher 1997). In this paper, firstly, I introduce these two theoretical approaches and, secondly, I discuss their possible implications for the practice of social work. The theoretical approaches are identified on the basis of a literature review, particularly of literature focused on female users of illegal drugs. The practical implications I discuss on the basis of my own experiences which I gained as a social worker with drug users in the Czech Republic. Adapted from the source document.

Socio-Spatial Approaches to Social Work

Author: Spatscheck, Christian11 Hochschule Bremen, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417521809?accountid=14925

Abstract: This essay argues for the consideration of spatial approaches to social work. Spatial sensitivity and reflection allows a multi-level understanding of social spaces beyond individualistic, clinical and single-case oriented concepts of social work. Also, this perspective enables interesting collaborations between social work practitioners and researchers and supports a research based practice. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work and Elder Abuse: A Foucauldian Analysis

Author: Powell, Jason L11 University of Liverpool, United Kingdom

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417525147?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recently, there an accelerating interest in elder abuse has arisen due to the implementation of community care policies relying upon informal care and a relentless political campaign to legitimise an enforced obligation to care. The use of care management technologies that focus on assessment and inspection, can, in this policy climate, become a means of surveillance and enforcement of informal caring. It is argued that Michel Foucault offers a set of strategies (Foucault 1977: 205) for understanding how the discourses on community care construct older people's experiences and their identities, as constructed subjects and objects of managerial knowledge. Adapted from the source document.

Fieldwork in Social Work Education and Training: Issues and Challenges in the Case of Eastern and Southern Africa

Author: Dhemba, Jotham11 National University of Lesotho, Lesotho

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524997?accountid=14925

Abstract: While it is widely accepted that fieldwork and its theory counterpart in social work education are of equal importance, the fieldwork component is marginalised at some social work training institutions in Eastern and Southern Africa. This study, which was carried out at three selected social work training institutions involved gathering data from social work students, agency supervisors and fieldwork coordinators using personal interviews and questionnaires. The study found that there are practices at these institutions that inadvertently diminish its importance. Such practices include the use of non-social work agency supervisors, lack of training for agency supervisors, the lack of a fieldwork curriculum and non-existent or inadequate funding of fieldwork related activities. It is quite clear that inadequate funding is the root cause of most of the challenges bedeviling fieldwork and that fieldwork shall remain just a ritual if this situation is not addressed. Adapted from the source document.

Does "Evidence-Based Policy" Help Protect LGBT Rights? A View from U.S. Social Work

Author: McMillin, Stephen Edward11 University of Chicago, Illinois, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524442?accountid=14925

Abstract: Activists who work for LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered) equality frequently claim such equality to be a matter of human and/or civil rights and therefore organize their legal activism accordingly. However, U.S. courts have often failed to acknowledge these rights or to recognize LGBT persons as a legal class. In this essay, Stephen Edward McMillin discusses the current emphasis on evidence based policy and practice in child and family social work, arguing that this approach has been pragmatically effective in advancing LGBT rights to adopt and foster children even when LGBT human and civil rights remain formally unacknowledged in much of U.S. law. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Education in the Arab Countries

Author: Albrithen, Abdulaziz11 Social Work with the Department of Social Studies, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347786178?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work is yet to be recognised as a discipline independent of Sociology. In order to develop as an independent discipline in its own right, social work educators need to come together and examine the need to set standards for social work education and practice appropriate to their cultural contexts. This article attempts to review historical emergence of undergraduate, graduate and post graduate level social work education in Arabic countries. Adapted from the source document.

Citizens' Behaviour towards Welfare Schemes: Field Evidence from Jharkhand

Author: Bagchi, Moumita; Barik, Kaustuva

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347782888?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Indian government accords a critical role to welfare schemes for economic and social development. However, the success of implementation has been mixed. 'Perceived behaviour' of government officials towards citizens is hypothesized as critical in ensuring citizen participation and creating those factors as necessary for a citizen's interaction with government officials. This paper explores conceptual field evidence from Jharkhand, within the context of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act employment scheme. Adapted from the source document.

Unwed Motherhood among Tribals In South India

Author: Jose, Justin P1; Vinod, C V; Renjith, R; Jackson, George1 Centre for Social Work Research and Practice India, Chungakunnu, Kannur District, Kerala

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347786191?accountid=14925

Abstract: A qualitative inquiry was conducted to explore and document the lived experiences of being in unwed motherhood, their positions in the contexts of current relationships with their men, family and community. The analysis initially revealed that stigma produced and maintained diverse emotional and psychological responses. Second, families simultaneously remained as perpetrators of violence against unwed mothers and victims of extended stigma in tribal communities wherein family members were distanced, isolated and excluded from mainstream societal life. Further, stigma was extended to potential helpers such as peers and neighbours, resulting in social isolation and inadequate social support. Finally, due to perceived and actual experience of discrimination induced by stigma, unwed mothers enjoyed restricted physical mobility outside homes, community engagement and participation. Adapted from the source document.

Outcome Budgeting: An Overview and Methodological Issues

Author: Chakraborty, Pinaki1; Ganguly, Kaushik1 National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421358?accountid=14925

Abstract: Outcome budgeting is a major budgeting reform, aimed at moving away from just 'release of funds' to 'actual utilisation for intended purposes', and 'conversion of outlays to outcomes'. This paper argues that there are methodological challenges in the shift from performance budgets to outcome budgets. International experiences have thrown up evidence of limitations, which a sound framework for outcome budgeting needs to address. These include the need for commitment and leadership, clarity in understanding the underlying principles and institutional capacity. Further, for outcome budgeting to succeed, there is a need for reforms in accounting systems and a bottom-up approach to planning for development. Adapted from the source document.

Performance-based Budgeting: A Review of Experience and Lessons

Author: Ramakumar, R11 Centre for Development Studies, School of Social Sciences, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421365?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is a review of efforts to introduce performance-based budgeting in India. It attempts to discuss the context in which these new methods of budgeting have emerged and assess, with the help of published literature, their utility and impact. First, it deals with the global context in which the increasing concern with governmental efficiency has emerged. Second, it looks at the experiences of developed countries in the use of performance budgeting and results-based management (RBM). Third, it looks at the specific experience of India in the use of two major performance-based budgeting tools: 'performance budget' and 'outcome budget'. Fourth, in the light of the evidence, the article suggests a sharp turn away from certain prevalent orthodoxies in public expenditure management towards adopting practises that help deepen democracy and transparency. Adapted from the source document.

Social Audits in Outcome Budgeting: An Experiment of Accountability in Maharashtra

Author: Goyal, Java11 Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421097?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social Audits were carried out to understand people's perception about the outcomes of public services in thirty-two flagship schemes of the outcome budget exercise in Maharashtra. The mandate of the Public Verification Exercise (PVE) was to make state budgets sensitive to the outcomes that directly affect people's everyday lives, especially those in which they encounter state machinery. The paper reveals how the concepts of social audit were adapted into a PVE jointly conducted by the state government departments and a public university. The paper discusses the origins of social audit and recent trends of using social audits as instruments of accountability in the wake of democratic decentralisation and devolution of powers to local bodies. In doing so, the paper critically examines two schemes implemented in Maharashtra and poses more questions on the ongoing debates on the notions of public accountability itself that differs across stakeholder groups. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Even while Information Communication Technologies(ICTs) are perceived to have positive impact on socioeconomic development, lack of concomitant mechanisms to enable the poorer sections of the society to access useful information and engage with decision making processes would render ICTs to be less effective in bringing about social transformation. The paper discusses the issues involved in viewing development of ICTs as a prerequisite for socioeconomic development, with special reference to e- governance. The key concerns to be addressed in a citizen centric e-governance programme which include equity, transparency, responsiveness and accountability warrant substantial changes in the approaches towards developing and implementing such progammes. Various issues involved in developing comprehensive e- governance initiatives to strengthen grassroots level institutions in order to improve service delivery and development administration are critically examined. Inferences drawn from the experiences in establishing e-governance in local self government institutions in Kerala emphasise the need to shift towards a participatory paradigm of e-governance to empower people through ICTs.

Reaching the Unreached: Integrated Child Development Services in Maharashtra

Author: Datta, Vrinda1; Goyal, Jaya1 Centre for Human Ecology, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421033?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is a common refrain that public investments made in Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) fails to bring any marked reduction in undernutrition rates among children in Maharashtra. The problem seems to be not of inadequate allocations, but of inefficient spending. The outcome budget initiative for the ICDS scheme provides strategies to maximise resource utilisation for tangible and equitable outcomes. The paper does not analyse the performance of the ICDS scheme in the state, but describes methods of outcome budgeting audit that led to an outcome based planning and budgeting for the scheme. The paper delineates some prerequisites before attempting an outcome budget for a scheme in addition to constraints and challenges of attempting this methodology. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Jojo, Bipin K11 Centre for Social Justice and Governance, School of Social Work, Tata institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504420832?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Government Ashram Schools cater to a large number of tribal children. They are supposed to provide free education to tribal children for the enhancement of the socioeconomic development of the tribal society. Hence, the Ashram school complexes are residential schools with free hostels, food, uniforms, books and stationery, and accommodation for the teachers and staff. However, it has been observed that poor infrastructural facilities affect the quality of education. The processes of the outcome budgeting exercise provides opportunities for participatory, transparent and accountable practices for efficient administration of Ashram schools.

Author: Jaswal, Surinder1; Goyal, Jaya1 School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504421364?accountid=14925

Abstract: Jeevandayi Arogya Yojana, recently re-launched and renamed as Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayi Arogya Yojana is a unique and popular health scheme in Maharashtra. The scheme has been in operation since the last fifteen years and provides for free surgeries to Below Poverty Line (BPL) patients in the state. An outcome based analysis of the scheme as discussed in this paper reveals the extent to which the scheme is able to reach out to the poor, thus enabling them to access tertiary care. The paper provides lessons on the implementation of outcome methodology for a health scheme that may be useful to other agencies and governments interested in outcome budgeting. Adapted from the source document.

Strategies For Strengthening The Entry And Exit Systems Of The Residual Welfare Model

Author: Yu, Kar Ming11 The Hong Kong Institute of Education, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283640399?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over the last two decades, the development of social welfare in many capitalist societies has not only been challenged ideologically by the right-wing social scientists but has also been endangered by fiscal crisis. While many right-wing capitalist governments have not directly rolled backed the welfare state, they are committed to reconstructing the welfare system so as to promote investment opportunities for the private sector and to enhance market values. This is found not only in Western capitalist societies but also in advanced Eastern societies. One of the strategies used by the governments is to residualise social services and promote the residual welfare model. However, because of the constraints of political reality capitalist governments very often find it difficult to fully realise the residual welfare model. Thus, it may try to secure a partial residualisation of social services. This can be achieved by a number of methods, including strengthening either the entry system or the exit system of the residual welfare model, and developing the double-entry and double-exit systems. Adapted from the source document.

Baseline Findings Of A Prospective Study On Pro-Offending Attitudes And Self-Reported Problems Among Juvenile Probationers

Author: Chui, Wing Hong1; Chan, Heng Choon1 Department of Social Work and Social Administration, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong ericchui@hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283640407?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although there are scholarly articles and government reports published over the years (Chui, 2004, 2006; Lo et al., 1997), little is known about the effectiveness of the current Hong Kong probation system in reducing juvenile probationers' recidivism risk and easing their community reintegration process. Thus, this Phase One study of an ongoing three-phase longitudinal project aims to set a baseline to measure the pro-offending attitudes and self-reported problems of 77 male juvenile offenders (aged 14 to 20) who recently started their probation period at a residential home using CRIME-PICS II. Phases Two and Three will be conducted upon the completion of their probation and eventual release into their community. Within-programme changes will be measured to examine the effectiveness of the current juvenile probation practice. Sample demographic characteristics, offender criminal history, and CRIME-PICS II descriptive findings are presented. This project is imperative in several aspects with implications for both public policy and social work practice. Adapted from the source document.

Community work is one of the three basic social work intervention methods

Author: Anonymous

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283640897?accountid=14925

Abstract: Community work is one of the three basic social work intervention methods. However, recent developments in social work emphasize clinical practices and increasingly neglect the importance of community work practice. Western scholars have already pointed out that the focus of the social work profession on developing interventions and practices for individuals, families, and social groups as well as counseling and therapeutic models needs to be complemented by reclaiming an emphasis on community work. This article examines why social work should include community work and discusses the following meanings of community work in social work: (1) making clear the social of social work; (2) community regarded as a target group; (3) inclusion of macro perspective and practice; (4) the effective use of community resources; (5) unfolding the advocacy role of community work; (6) fulfilling the function of promoting social change; and (7) counteracting the negative effects of professionalization. This article also discusses the challenges brought about by social changes to social work and suggests the future directions for community work. Adapted from the source document.

Tribal Development Scenario in West Bengal: A Study of Jamalpur Block of Burdwan District

Author: Mallick, Mohammed Ayub11 Faculty Member with the Department of Political Science, University of Kalyani, Kalyani, Nadia, West Bengal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037876691?accountid=14925

Abstract: Tribal development in West Bengal is directed towards ensuring an immediate boost to agricultural production in tribal areas, improve economic conditions of the landless among the tribals, recognise the co-operative and marketing structures, and to provide employment and increased income to the tribals. Family-based economic programmes include land reclamation, land development, supply of agricultural inputs and the like. The area-based economic programmes include construction of roads, execution of minor irrigation and lift irrigation schemes and so on. Although, the tribals are in the process of transition from a traditional society to a modern society, they are going through the process of institutionalised exploitation and socio-political marginalisation. They are not health conscious and yet practice traditional methods of medicine. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Quarry workers form a major part of the work force of the unorganised industrial sector. Various psychosocial stressors makes quarry workers vulnerable to various psychological disorders. The current study focuses on psychological distress, disability levels and the quality of community life existing among quarry workers. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation between psychological distress and disability. The community of quarry workers live in pathetic conditions. Statistics reveal that 97.6% have no sanitation, toilet or drainage facilities. The implications of the results are discussed and the need for professional guidance from psychiatric social workers.

Author: Ozkan, Yasemin1; Purutcuoglu, Eda1 Department of Social Work, Faculty of Health Science, University of Ankara, Turkey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037876733?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the socio-demographic characteristics of elderly people with respect to the effects of gender on their life satisfaction. The simple random sampling method was used to collect data from a sample of 211 older adults from nursing homes located in central Ankara. The data revealed that the satisfaction level of female respondents was low. However, in the case of male respondents, life satisfaction was related to self-confidence. The study also revealed a significant relationship among all six dimensions (satisfied, penitent, depressive, optimist, pessimist, self-confident) with life satisfaction. Adapted from the source document.

Policy Dimensions of Exclusion: Disability as Charity and Not Right in Zimbabwe

Author: Mtetwa, Edmos11 School of Social Work, University of Zimbabwe mthethwanm@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037876748?accountid=14925

Abstract: The social model of disability advocates for fundamental and not incremental or piecemeal changes to public policies. It views disability as a product, not of impairment but of the social environment that constricts opportunities for one group by labelling it highly incapacitated. The Disabled Persons Act, administered by the Department of Social Welfare, assumes that it is the impairment that causes disability and not the social environment in which persons with impairments live. From such a policy framework, disability is viewed from a charitable and not from a human rights perspective. The Act gives employers discretionary powers to decide the nature of jobs to be given to persons with disabilities, making them extremely vulnerable to discrimination in the labour market. Given such a state of affairs within the national policy framework, persons with disabilities are treated as objects of pity rather than rights holders. Unfortunately, the Disabled Persons' Organizations suffer a lot of technical and financial challenges. They are, therefore, grossly incapacitated to fight the discrimination endured by their members. Adapted from the source document.

Cyberspace Communication: The Perceived Influence of Computer Technology on Teenagers and their Relationships with their Parents

Author: Mavimbela, Jabulile1; Ross, Eleanor1 Department of Social Work, University of Witwatersrand, South Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037876767?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study explored the views of parents and adolescents regarding the influence of computer technology on teenagers and their relationships with their parents. An exploratory-descriptive, qualitative design was employed which involved the administration of questionnaires for parents and teenagers. The main finding was that use of computer technology ranged from 1-5 hours per day. Participants were aware of the advantages and limitations of the internet, chat rooms, cell phones and computer games. While computer technology was reported to have brought some family members closer, others had become more estranged. The conclusion drawn is that social workers need to help families to achieve a balance between exploiting the potential of computer technology and avoiding the dangers therein. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Leelavathi, B1; Vijayalakshmi, J; Regan, D Stalin A; Krishnan, R Anandha1 Special Teachers, National Institute for Empowerment of the Persons with Multiple Disabilities, Chennai, Tamil Nadu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714044?accountid=14925

Abstract: The pedagogy used for teaching children with special needs is unique to their circumstances. The teacher is instrumental in adopting various innovative approaches. Social skills form the basis for living, working and functioning within the community. With this perspective in mind, the researchers have attempted to study the development of social skills among eight children with deafblindness studying in the Thermai Special School of the National Institute for Empowerment of persons with Multiple Disabilities, Chennai. This experimental research was conducted to document the effect of circle games on development of social skills and to compare its effectiveness with existing classroom instructions. Both the groups-experimental and classroom-received 30 sessions of training with the help of special educators. Analysis of data showed a significant improvement in social skills among children in the experimental group. It was found, that circle games were effective in the development of social skills in children across the age range of 9-15 years. Adapted from the source document.

Building Women Empowered Communities for Governance: A Social Work Perspective

Author: Kumar, Shewli11 Centre for Equity for Women, Children and Families, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714101?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the various nuances of women's experiences as they negotiate their victimised status to move towards empowerment. Feminist social work has to explore the existing agency of women and work towards their empowerment, by creating spaces to listen to their voices, developing capacity to articulate their issues and build strengths to deal with oppressive conditions which inhibit their potential for participation in governance. This article is an attempt to develop such a model of practice drawing from existing work in the field being done with women in North East India and Dalit women activists. Adapted from the source document.

Ideas Old and New in Rural Development: Looking Back in Time

Author: Kumar, Ajit11 Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy, National Law School of India University, Nagarbhavi, Bangalore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714129?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Indian village came to be studied by thinkers of different ages-from Karl Marx and Henry Maine to Mahatma Gandhi and Babasaheb Ambedkar. After Independence concerted efforts were made to raise the standard of life of these communities but the results were mixed. The success of the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGREGA), enacted in 2005 raises an intriguing question as to why such an act was not considered earlier given the extent of India's rural poverty. To answer this question one has to go back to the ideas of rural development prevailing during the independence era. This article critiques the ideas of the 1952 community development programme which was an exemplar of the Indian approach to rural development. A host of similar rural development programmes continued to set the agenda for a largely infructuous policy of poverty alleviation till the 2005 MGREG Act. This Act has been a small beacon of hope for alleviating rural poverty and provides an alternate philosophy to rural development. Adapted from the source document.

Cross-Cutting Issues: Disability and the Constitution Making Process for Zimbabwe

Author: Mtetwa, Edmos11 School of Social Work, University of Zimbabwe mthethwanm@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714135?accountid=14925

Abstract: The framing of its constitution is of historic and political significance to Zimbabwe. This process which was born out of a negotiated political settlement is predicated upon democratic and participatory principles. To this end, persons with disabilities feel that the process is not inclusive enough. Inevitably, persons with disabilities do have numerous concerns some of which may not be easily put in a constitution. These issues include social exclusion in the field of education, health, political participation, HIV prevention, care and support as well as those affecting economic spheres of life. This paper is a result of the research conducted by the author in January 2010 at Rainbow Towers during the training of the outreach team of the constitution making process. The paper came up with recommendations from both the participants and the author. This paper is hardly meant to be a highly academic endeavour but is just a paper designed to tell the story as it is. Adapted from the source document.

Professional Social Work Education in India: A Critical View from the Periphery

Author: Bodhi, S R11 Centre for Social Justice and Governance, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai bodhi@tiss.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714149?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social Work education in India is going through an interregnum crisis. Traditional dominant discourses have become irrelevant and are nearing demise, yet comprehensive progressive alternative discourses are still to acquire any concrete content. In such a process, an understanding is dawning among many critical social work educators, that it is only in countering worldview of 'dominants', generally accepted as the norm in social work education, will the opportunity of developing alternative liberatory discourses and concomitant practice paradigms be possible. Furthering such an aim, this note is an articulation of critical reflections and contains personal experiential accounts of social work education, emanating from few years of engagement with social work academia. It discusses the status of social work education in India, identifies the contours of contemporary debates within and proposes a movement towards indigenous liberatory social work education and practice. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This paper explores the variety of ways Masters' of Social Work (MSW) programs across Canada integrate classroom research activities with field experiences. By conducting a review of the websites of Canadian schools of social work, the authors note the ways in which Canadian schools of social work require students to meet the accreditation standards for the Canadian Association of Social Work Education (CASWE). Using a case example, they discuss the methods and benefits of integrating classroom research activities with field experiences. The authors reaffirm the value of integrating the two experiences in ensuring the professional development of excellent research and practical skills in MSW students.

The Need for All-Hazard Awareness and Risk Assessment in a Devolving Border Environment

Author: Hamilton, Adam L; Furley, E Norman

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364703868?accountid=14925

Abstract: The risks associated with an increasingly unstable United States/Mexico border are growing national concerns in both countries. Headlines often include quotes from leaders of both nations that express outrage over reports of human trafficking, drug cartel activity, and the murder of civilians and government officials. And while the threats resulting from lawless behaviors are real, any consideration of the dangers that both nations face along the border is incomplete without a recurring, informed deliberation on the risks associated with the aforementioned threats and other hazards. Security and risk management along the U.S./Mexico border is a pressing issue that will require well-informed decisions to make effective mitigation investments. Until both countries and the affected states join in collaborative efforts to periodically assess the full spectrum of threats and hazards to identify and prioritize the real risks, it will be increasingly difficult to distinguish perceived or sensationalized threats (often highlighted in the news media) from hazards that are potentially catastrophic to one or both nations and develop the best risk mitigation plans for residents on both sides of the border. Adapted from the source document.

Can Continuing Education Curricula Effectively Teach Professionals? A Case for Using a Curriculum Assessment Tool for Initial and Ongoing Evaluation

Author: Coyle, James P; Carter, Irene

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714180?accountid=14925

Abstract: Continuing professional education (CPE) is expected and required in most human services professions. Increased use of CPE requires methods for evaluating and credentialing training workshops or courses. This paper describes the development of a tool for assessing important aspects of CPE training: curriculum content and instructional methods. The tool identifies standards based on social worker learning needs, theories of adult learning, and continuing education assessment. This tool is flexible as to content and learning needs and it is easy to use. It can help continuing education coordinators, human relations departments, training consultants and developers, and credentialing organizations improve training quality and monitor training effectiveness. Adapted from the source document.

Mexico's Law Enforcement Challenge: The Case Study of Ciudad Juarez

Author: Ainslie, Ricardo

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364703877?accountid=14925

Abstract: With respect to Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs), there is a long-standing history of corruption and collusion within Mexican law enforcement that goes back to the 1970s when Rafael Aguilar, the head of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS by its Mexican acronym) in the state of Chihuahua, became one of the founders of the Juarez Cartel. Until his death in 1997, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who rose to take over the Juarez Cartel, was known to have highly placed contacts within Mexican law enforcement, beginning with the Mexican Federal Judicial Police, which controlled the highways and the airports, to state and municipal police forces which he controlled outright in the states that were of importance to the Juarez Cartel's operations. The same is true of the other powerful Mexican drug cartels -- historically they have had a firm grip on the law enforcement agencies in the states where they operate and, at times, at the federal level as well. For this reason, there have been many efforts to clean up Mexico's various police forces, and most have met with mixed results at best. Yet, effectively combating DTOs requires effective law enforcement. Adapted from the source document.

The Second Annual Survey of Continuing Education Programs Conducted by Professional Development: The International Journal of Continuing Social Work Education

Author: Cochran, Gerald; Landuyt, Noel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714185?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 2009, Professional Development: The International Journal of Continuing Social Work Education conducted a survey of continuing education (CE) programs in North America. Results of this survey were published in the Journal in the summer 2010. The purpose of this survey was to establish a foundation of information to act as a benchmark and a resource for CE program directors, program administrators, and the broader social services community. Also, the collection of this information was intended to operate as an impetus in shaping future collaboration between programs, which has the potential to improve the overall quality and effectiveness of CE programs. Investigators from Professional Development: The International Journal of Continuing Social Work Education re-administered the survey in 2010 and this report updates the responses from the 2009 survey of CE programs as well as reports responses from the 2010 survey. Adapted from the source document.

Austin from a Different Perspective

Author: Thrash, Gregory

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364703989?accountid=14925

Abstract: As with any large metropolitan area, especially one that has experienced the drastic growth that Austin has seen, the area has its share of crime including drug trafficking. What is unsettling, however, is the role Austin now plays in the globally scoped, highly compartmentalized, and unusually disciplined underworld of the Mexican drug cartels. Mexican drug cartel leaders operate from a shroud of secrecy -- and to some degree security -- in Mexico, while leveraging generational and familial ties in cities across the United States to carry out orders and conduct business on behalf of these Mexico-based bosses. Adapted from the source document.

Promoting Accessibility and Adding Value to Social Work Education

Author: Carter, Irene; Leslie, Donald; Angell, Brent

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714188?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper highlights the development of an interdisciplinary Honours Disability Studies Program, at the University of Windsor, stressing that the collaborative support of dedicated faculty, activists, and community organizations made it possible. The program was based on the social model of disability that is compatible with the social work values of social justice and accessibility and social work's commitment to diversity and the elimination of oppression. The field of disability studies is presented as a venue for broadening the value of social work education by adding perspectives from interdisciplinary fields that transcend single disciplines. The authors conclude that social work and disability studies, in combination, result in interdisciplinary courses and programs about disability, policy advocacy about disability, and actions that promote accessibility. Adapted from the source document.

The Dying Elephant: Prelude to a Failed State

Author: Lauderdale, Michael

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1364704001?accountid=14925

Abstract: Globalization in several forms has been a dominant theme at times in the world since Cyrus the Great of Persia, and later, the Romans, both empires which pushed far from home to distant lands. In more recent times --since 1648-- globalization was driven by the colonial powers of Europe. Late in the 20th century globalization was generated by international capitalism as well as technological advances and the search for cheaper resources, including labor. This phase of globalization is likely ending as cheap oil and other resources critical for industrialized societies become dearer, and with the United States spread thin with foreign responsibilities and mounting debts. Yet the impact of globalization continues to play out with unforeseen events. Some of those that first affected the American Southwest and Mexican Border are examined. These events will force new directions upon the United States. The directions chosen are not clear but the direction that is chosen will have a substantial impact on the nation and its neighbors. We end with a consideration of strategic and tactical alternatives to deal with the Mexican collapse, and the resulting high levels of refugees, and the growing violence in Mexico and on the border that are being projected into the United States. Adapted from the source document.

The Salisbury Statement

Author: The Salisbury Forum Group

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498588?accountid=14925

Abstract: Professionals in the early 21st century are required to practice more effectively amid the increasing challenge of uncertainty and complexity. The widespread call for evidence-based practice is a major response to this. Yet contemporary approaches to research often fail to produce adequate evidence or knowledge about practice for use in variable situations. How is professional practice to be researched better, to provide a basis for improved practice? This question affects us all, and is answered in both similar and different ways across a range of countries and professions. Mapping the range of answers to this question is an important step in developing research for better practice. In June 2008, a group of interested professionals came together in Salisbury, UK, to begin this mapping by formulating an international statement on practice research. The group was comprised of academics and practitioners from a range of countries (the Nordic countries, Italy, Canada, the USA, Israel, Singapore and the UK). This group formed the backbone of the group known as the "Salisbury Forum". The group was comprised primarily of social workers, but tried to formulate a statement which might be applied more broadly in all professions where the research of practice is important. The statement is not intended to be definitive or conclusive, but simply aims to begin tracing the contours of practice research at this point in time as it continues to evolve. Adapted from the source document.

Partnership in Practice Research: a Norwegian Experience

Author: Fook, Jan1; Johannessen, A; Psoinos, M1 Royal Holloway University of London jan.fook@rhul.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498597?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article outlines some of the issues involved in developing partnerships between service users, practitioners and researchers. It discusses these through some experience in Oslo as part of a national level agreement (HUSK) to improve social services in Norway through research and knowledge development. It begins with a review of the main concepts and debates involved in developing collaborative partnerships for practice-based research, particularly in the social services arena. The HUSK program is then described. The article then traces some specific developments and challenges in negotiating partnership relations as discussed by program participants (users, practitioners and researchers) in a series of workshops designed to elicit the issues directly from their experience. Adapted from the source document.

What is Practice Research in Social Work - Definitions, Barriers and Possibilities

Author: Uggerhoj, Lars11 Aalborg University lug@socsci.aau.dk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498599?accountid=14925

Abstract: Practice is subject to increasing pressure to demonstrate its ability to achieve outcomes required by public policy makers. As part of this process social work practice has to engage with issues around advancing knowledge-based learning processes in a close collaboration with education and research based perspectives. This has given rise to approaches seeking to combine research methodology, field research and practical experience. Practice research is connected to both "the science of the concrete" - a field of research oriented towards subjects more than objects and "mode 2 knowledge production" - an application-oriented research where frameworks and findings are discussed by a number of partners. Practice research is defined into two approaches: practice research - collaboration between practice and research - and practitioner research - processes controlled and accomplished by practitioners. The basic stakeholders in practice research are social workers, service users, administrators, management, organisations, politicians and researchers. Accordingly, practice research is necessarily collaborative, involving a meeting point for different views, interests and needs, where complexity and dilemmas are inherent. Instead of attempting to balance or reconcile these differences, it is important to respect the differences if collaboration is to be established. The strength of both practice and research in practice research is to address these difficult challenges. The danger for both fields is to avoid and reject them. Adapted from the source document.

Knowledge-Production Processes in Practice Research - Outcomes and Critical Elements

Author: Julkunen, Ilse11 Helsinki University lug@socsci.aau.dk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498602?accountid=14925

Abstract: The welfare sector has seen considerable changes in its operational context. Welfare services respond to an increasing number of challenges as citizens are confronted with life's uncertainties and a variety of complex situations. At the same time the service-delivery system is facing problems of co-operation and the development of staff competence, as well as demands to improve service effectiveness and outcomes. In order to ensure optimal user outcomes in this complex, evolving environment it is necessary to enhance professional knowledge and skills, and to increase efforts to develop the services. Changes are also evident in the new emergent knowledge-production models. There has been a shift from knowledge acquisition and transmission to its construction and production. New actors have stepped in and the roles of researchers are subject to critical discussion. Research outcomes, in other words the usefulness of research with respect to practice development, is a topical agenda item. Research is needed, but if it is to be useful it needs to be not only credible but also useful in action. What do we know about different research processes in practice? What conceptions, approaches, methods and actor roles are embedded? What is the effect on practice? How does 'here and now' practice challenge research methods? This article is based on the research processes conducted in the institutes of practice research in social work in Finland. It analyses the different approaches applied by elucidating the theoretical standpoints and the critical elements embedded in them, and reflects on the outcomes in and for practice. It highlights the level of change and progression in practice research, arguing for diverse practice research models with a solid theoretical grounding, rigorous research processes, and a supportive infrastructure. Adapted from the source document.

Habituation, Coercion, Education: Labour in the History of Social Welfare

Author: Hauss, Gisela11 University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland, Hochschule fur Soziale Arbeit gisela.hauss@fhnw.ch

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633482?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article assumes that the role of social work within the new paradigm of the welfare state has hitherto been barely considered from an historical perspective. It thus aims to foster critical reflection on this issue. By reappropriating history, it seeks to open up new perspectives within the ongoing debate on activation policies in the field of social work. It focuses on three case studies concerning the significance of male and female labour in nineteenth- and twentieth-century welfare. To this end, the results of our own and other research were drawn upon (Hauss 1995, Lippuner 2005). Further, data from a recently completed research project were subject to a secondary analysis. Gender was defined as a central category. The interest in these historical case studies stems from the rapidly changing debates within social work since the 1950s; these debates are surveyed in the opening paragraph of the following section. After that the cases are discussed within the context of the history of labour, the changing relationship between the welfare state and the labour market, and the accompanying shifts in gender arrangements. These shifts establish the historical context for a discussion of the case studies. The basis assumption underlying this discussion is that an historical awareness enables critical reflection on the professions dependency on social policy and labour market developments. History raises our awareness of the thought patterns guiding institutional action in certain directions. The various points for discussion resulting from the three Swiss case studies presented here, in a country whose welfare state emerged only hesitantly, are relevant to debating social work in Europe, even if Switzerland is but one example of the many exceptions among European welfare states. Adapted from the source document.

Historical Perspective on the Ideologies of Motherhood and Its Impact on Social Work

Author: Leskosek, Vesna11 University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Social Work vesna.leskosek@fsd.uni-lj.si

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633485?accountid=14925

Abstract: Throughout history, many attempts have been made to construct femininity. Women were chained to their homes by various rituals, customs and traditions that acted as unwritten laws which must be complied with. The construction of femininity was the most intense in times of industrialisation when migration from the countryside to the city was at its height. Social relations became more complex, with private life in rural communities no longer being subject to an effective social control. The modernization and emergence of new roles and power centres during the late 19th century deprived women of even those rights that they had enjoyed until then. There were several ways in which they were restricted and their roles and social positions determined. The most important were those that were a result of discourses on femininity. In this article, we will concentrate on the ideologies of motherhood and their impact on early social services for women and single mothers. We will restrict ourselves to early 20th century Europe, when contemporary divisions into the east and west, the north and the south had not yet been in place. Although in many ways the constructions of reality have specific local features, feminist theory has shown that the ideologies of motherhood place women in similar positions in the most part of the world. This article will therefore adhere to the general overview that does not comprise specific dimensions of the construction of motherhood within different and specific cultural, social and political contexts. Adapted from the source document.

Social Service Professions Towards Cross-European Standardisation of Qualifications

Author: Matthies, Aila-Leena11 University of Jyvaskyla aila-leena.matthies@chydenius.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498608?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, which is based on a more comprehensive report (Family Platform 2010), I maintain a comparative cross-European view in order to map out the qualifications of the core professions within the social services. Social workers refers here to those professionals who hold the highest academic qualification in the field of social services, and its profile might need no further definition in this context (see IFSW 2010). Secondly, qualification of the staff in child daycare services -- i.e. child daycare centres, kindergartens and child daycare groups -- will be analysed. Lastly, the current cross-European definition of social carer qualifications in practical work supporting people in need will be included in this discussion. Unfortunately, the analysis is limited only to more formal and quantitative dimensions of qualification; a more substantial analysis cannot be included in this paper. The analysis is based on available comparative documents on qualifications in the three comprehensive professional fields of social services and will focus on the following questions: is formal qualification required at all (particularly in social care)?; how are the various task levels differentiated with respect to qualification within the service field (particularly in child daycare)?; is a Bachelors (BA) or Masters (MA) level of education required (particularly in social work)? These three central fields of tasks in social services serve to yield a more comprehensive understanding of the entire profile of social service in Europe. Adapted from the source document.

Between Public Health and Social Work: Visiting Nurses in the Struggle Against Poverty and Infant Mortality in Bulgaria 1923-1934

Author: Popova, Kristina11 South-West University Blagoevgrad, Faculty for Law and History chadoblg@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633488?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this article is to present the connection between biopolitical measures and social work in Bulgaria and the visiting nurses, the first steps to the development of professional social work. There are only a few publications on this topic (Baloutzova 2011; Promitzer and others 2011; Author 2009). The article is based primarily on quantitative sources about the activities of the first Children Health Station in Sofia and other cities from the Central State Archive and statistics.

Social Agencies for Children and Families as Street Level Bureaucracies. A Case Study

Author: Capello, Fabio11 University of Trento, Doctoral School in Social Sciences -- Comparative Social Work f.cappellorizzarello@unitn.it

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633499?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social workers in public welfare services can be considered, according to Michael Lipsky theorization, street level bureaucrats. Lipsky (1980) defines as street level bureaucrats all public service workers who interact directly with citizens and have substantial discretion in the execution of their work. They are professionals who grant access to State programs and provide services within these programs; but they also operate in an environment where resources are chronically inadequate to the task they are asked to perform, where goals expectations tend to be ambiguous, conflicting or vague and where the demand for services tends to increase constantly to meet the supply. The working conditions of street level bureaucrats are unavoidably uncertain: they are regularly confronted with dilemmas that are not just ethical but also organizational. Due to this situation, discretion represents for them, simultaneously, a crucial tool to work with in very complicated situations -- where the human dimension is essential -- and an important option in order to solve or simplify the mentioned organizational contradictions. In the first case discretion may be synonymous of professional autonomy; in the second it may represent a strategy to cope with uncertainties and work pressures, often through the rationing of services (which may even mean autonomous reduction of the level of services). Adapted from the source document.

Ruling Relations of the Church's Social Work in the Lutheran Church in Finland

Author: Jokela, Ulla11 Helsinki University Ulla.Jokela@diak.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887500480?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Evangelical Lutheran Church's social work -- we can call it diaconia work as well -- has no official role in the Finnish welfare state model. It has been seen rather as a Christian-based, local and casual actor (Gronlund & Hiilamo 2006, 134). This is remarkable, since diaconia work and public social work have common historical roots. Besides, they have similarities in their ethical basis and action models (Iivari & Karjalainen 1999, 19). Although the church is a public actor with its right to collect taxes and perform ceremonies, there are a lot of features of the third sector in its action, which especially come out in diaconia work (Gronlund & Hiilamo 2006, 134). Karjalainen (2000, 268-269) argues that although diaconia work is unofficial, it is in the same time very large social work: if we sum paid church social workers and voluntary workers together, the number of them comes very near to the quantity of municipal grass-root level social workers. There has been little research on the meaning of diaconia work as experienced in the clients' life and hence further studies are needed. Thus, my main research question concern: What is the meaning of diaconia work for everyday life of the clients? I am investigating the research question with two sub-questions: a) How diaconia's work among clients takes shape; b) What kind of ruling relations exist in diaconia work. In my research these questions are approached from the point of daily practices of diaconia work and especially the perspective of client is in the focus. I reveal the helping process in the client work of diaconia visible and investigate it especially by mirroring clients' experiences and locate the present diaconia work in the Finnish welfare system.

Childhood Homes as Moral Spaces -- New Conceptual Arena

Author: Forsberg, Hannele1; Poso, Tarja1 University of Tampere, School of Social Sciences and Humanities hannele.forsberg@uta.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633507?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the concept of home is widely used in child welfare policies and practises, we do, however, recognize that children's social relations and belonging to the place called 'home' are fluid, contextual and mobile. We therefore challenge the ideals of childhood based on a 'residential fixity of home' and as the only reference point. Evidently, there is a need to reassess the ideas of home that are used in child welfare policies and social work practices with children. Reflecting the ideas of home is important, because notions of home have different implications for the positions of children and some of them can be part of the othering processes of children. Indeed, such a need for reflection goes beyond the Finnish context that provides one of the primary resource bases of this essay. Adapted from the source document.

Child Poverty. A Critical Perspective.

Author: Mestrum, Francine11 Universite Libre de Bruxelles mestrum@skynet.be

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887500489?accountid=14925

Abstract: The issue of child poverty is currently high on the policy agenda of the European Union and its member states and has been featured as a political priority in many national action plans on poverty and social exclusion over the past decade. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child often serves as a framework for taking into account the comprehensive and multi-dimensional approach to poverty, hence also stating the importance of social work as an important actor in fighting a diversity of poverty-related problems. In this essay, Francine Mestrum discusses the current conceptualizations of (child) poverty, arguing that a multi-dimensional approach to poverty as well as a focus on child poverty can be problematic. Adapted from the source document.

Ilse Arlt -- The Austrian Pioneer of Poverty and Welfare Research Based Social Work Theory and Practice

Author: Maiss, Maria11 University of Applied Studies St. Polten, Ilse Arlt Institute for Social Inclusion Research maria.maiss@fhstp.ac.at

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633509?accountid=14925

Abstract: Arlt's life work includes the collection of empirical "Foundations for Welfare" and the preparation for "Paths to a Science of Welfare" -- these are the titles of her two main publications in 1921 and 1958. Her academic work took place under the sign of a science of "poverty and welfare research". Arlt did not perceive this as a means in itself, but as an integral part of her concept of professional welfare and care. In her "Obituary of the first Austrian school for Welfare" Arlt writes in 1950 that her approach was well known "abroad, especially in England ... [as] the Austrian Method of Welfare Research and Education" (cp. Arlt 1950: 10). An unknown English author reported in 1948: "In October 1933 Ilse Arlt delivered the third Loch Memorial lecture 'On the way to the Scientific Analysis of Poverty'. From 1927 she had been in constant touch with C.O.S. work, through the Rev. J. C. Pringle. In 1936 she attended the International Congress on Social Work in London. In September 1937 came the jubilee commemoration of 25 years of work of her School of Social Work in Vienna, and the entry of the coming session included two English, one Swedish and several Czecho-Slovak students: Ilse Arlt's dream of an International School seemed to come true. In March 1938 came the Anschluss (annexation, M.M.), the shattering of the dream, the suppression of the School, and silence. This silence was broken in 1946, and early in 1947 came news that Ilse Arlt was trying in spite of almost overwhelming difficulties to re-open the School" (cp. unknown author 1948). Adapted from the source document.

Social Problems and Women's Politics in Eastern Europe -- Socialist, Feminist and Neo-Liberal Perspectives

Author: Hering, Sabine11 University of Siegen, Fakultat II (Bildung/Architektur/Kunste Hering@paedagogik.uni-siegen.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633504?accountid=14925

Abstract: The post-1989 transition from state socialism to capitalism and democracy has produced winners and losers. There is no doubt that women in Eastern Europe find themselves mainly among the loser. Irrespective of variations in economic and political development, birth-rates dramatically dropped in all countries of the former 'Eastern Bloc', while at the same time female unemployment increased significantly. Statistics disclose the reasons behind this development. They reveal a sharp decline in the number of places available in day nurseries for children, and an escalation of gender-specific segregation in the labour market. Both developments have contributed to a 'feminisation of poverty' which many Eastern European authorities accept as an inevitable consequence of modernisation. Considering these findings we have to ask if state socialism and its social provisions offered -- perhaps -- better conditions for women, at least for working mothers. But did socialism really solve the 'female question' as August Bebel has predicted? Did it abolish the suppression of women and promoted their rights? This was definitely not the case. Although gender equality was seen as an important goal in many socialist societies, and childcare and medical care were free, the countries of the Eastern Bloc were a far away from being the 'promised land' for women.

Merit Pay and Social Work

Author: Werling, Ursula H11 University of Munster u.werling@gmx.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633501?accountid=14925

Abstract: An economization of many social fields in Germany and other countries is under way, such as in the arts, journalism, education and science. Economic considerations have the upper hand in academic education (e.g., the introduction of tuition fees), while private co-payments have to be made for medical services (Schimank/Volkmann 2008, 382ff.). Social workers, too, can reminisce about the "good old days" when they did not know and did not have to think about the costs of a certain action, in comparison with alternatives. Economization has also found its way into the profession of social work (Schimank/Volkmann 2009, 386). In following the discussion about methods of social work since the early 1990s, one cannot deny that "since the beginning of the new millennium, all socio-pedagogical activities have mutated into management" (Galuske 2007, 333). The success story of economic methods of business management is based on the concept of so-called "New Public Management" and is mainly manifested in contract management and consequently in quality management. Contract management plays a central role in "New Public Management". It is a management instrument that is characterized by completion of a target agreement or a contract. The contract defines, for a given period of time, who is to implement which goals, in a verifiable manner. Contract management can be applied both inter-organizationally and intra-organizationally. The main foci are merit target agreements for particular products, payment agreements for budgets and the establishment of success indicators. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Between Oppression and Emancipation. Histories of Discomfort and Inspiration in Europe

Author: Waaldijk, Berteke11 Utrecht University, Faculty of Humanities m.l.waaldijk@uu.nl

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633492?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social workers who work with clients are used to asking about the past. They enquire about the personal history of the client. They try to find out how the problem their client deals with has developed. This allows them to 'start where the client is.' In that sense an interest in history is a 'natural' thing for social workers, just as all other professionals who deal with people they have to know and understand something about 'what happened until now'. History however is more than the individual facts that compose a person's past. History is also knowledge that goes beyond the individual; it describes how specific events can be understood in larger contexts of historical development. For social workers there are several ways in which knowledge about the past can be usefully expanded beyond understanding of the life-stories of individual clients. Adapted from the source document.

Conflict and Development in India's North-Eastern State of Manipur

Author: Shukhadeba Sharma, Hanjabam11 Department of Social Work Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Regional Campus, Manipur

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767478?accountid=14925

Abstract: The movement in Manipur is currently one of the ongoing armed movements for self-determination in the world. The concentration of security forces in the Manipur valley is akin to an occupational force, rather than a defence force of the country. The issue of militancy has not been given much importance by the Government of India; instead developmental works were initiated thinking that these will mitigate the militancy. The securitisation of development reached its peak, when the state governments were asked to get certificates from the Home Ministry to get funds from the Central Government. This article aims at highlighting these two issues. Adapted from the source document.

Public Distribution System in Kerala Reassessed

Author: Nair, Reshmy11 Centre for Poverty Studies and Rural Development Administrative Staff College of India Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767483?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Public Distribution System (PDS) had long been considered an important institutional intervention for maintaining food security in the chronically food deficit state of Kerala. The introduction of targeting and reforms in its pricing has cast a dent in the system, which is now a pale shadow of its celebrated past. Despite the manifold decline in the offtake from the PDS, the study finds that the genuinely poor continue to meet a major proportion of their consumption requirements from the system. The study points out that the highly arbitrary identification of beneficiaries and the resultant inclusion and exclusion errors has gone a long way in undermining the effective functioning of the PDS in the state. Given the high market prices for food grains and continued dependence on the PDS by the poor, high exclusion errors impose huge social costs. The study reveals the voluntary withdrawal by the economically better-off households from the PDS, implying that inclusion errors may not be really worrisome in Kerala. The study points out the futility of introducing TPDS in a state which was widely lauded for an efficiently run rationing system that bestowed progressively higher benefits to the poor and advocates immediate steps to restore the system to its past glory.

Life Satisfaction Among Urban Elderly: Implications For Social Work Practice

Author: Turlapati, Saraswati11 Coordinator of Kshemaya, Secunderabad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767492?accountid=14925

Abstract: India is witnessing a revolution in population ageing. An increased effort is required to understand the social and economic impact of this demographic transformation. In the Indian society, old age is often seen as a stage of weakening health, loneliness due to death of loved ones and separation from children. These changes subsequently impact life satisfaction among the older adults. This study was done to assess the level of life satisfaction among the elderly and to identify its determinants and conceptualise the implications for social work practice with the elderly in urban settings. Life satisfaction of the elderly -- an effect variable -- was studied in relation to a set of cause variables using the property-disposition approach of social research. Standardised scales were used to measure the key variables. Overall, about 40% of the variance in life satisfaction was explained by the four predictor variables, and this was statistically significant (F (4, 280) = 54.866, p < 0005). Considering the incredibly large number of variables that could affect an individual's level of life satisfaction, the ability to explain such a large amount of variance with only four variables is impressive. It is imperative for professional social workers to equip themselves with special intervention strategies and techniques and play a constructive role in enabling the elderly to live the last phase of their life in a contented manner.

Spirituality and Social Work: Some Deliberations

Author: Pandya, Samta P11 Centre for Equity for Women, Children and Families, School of Social Work Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767500?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is an attempt to comprehend association of spirituality and social work and the corresponding deliberations therein. Commencing with unearthing of the compound meanings of spirituality as an essentially transcendental construct, the rendition delves into the global and Indic conceptualisations of the same. A congruent exploration of the theistic and non-theistic propositions of spirituality also unveils certain key epistemic contentions that qualify as spirituality. Further contemporary discourses on spirituality and critical injunctions have also been reflexively considered. The discussion is then carried forward towards the realm of social sciences and the instances of transcendence and actualisation that qualify spirituality employed therein. Within social work apart from the repertoire of ethical underpinnings that embarks on spirituality tenets, domains of transpersonal social work practice have been conferred. Given the intensities and the brouhaha associated with the construct and its interrelationships, the article concludes with spaces that need to be negotiated to determine a curriculum on the subject. Adapted from the source document.

Perceptions About Mid-Day Meal Scheme: A Comparative Study Between Uttarakhand and Tamil Nadu

Author: Anbarasan, Vanmathy1; Ahuja, Abha1 School of Rural Development, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Tuijapur, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767505?accountid=14925

Abstract: Food Assisted Education (FAE) in India has revolutionised the primary education scenario. In-school feeding supports enrollment and attendance rate, lowers dropout rate, improves nutritional status and student's performance. However, the implementation of the Mid-Day Meals scheme (MDM) is not uniform across India. To bridge this gap, a research was undertaken to study the perceptions about the MDM scheme among its beneficiaries and functionaries in the states of Uttarakhand (where the scheme was recently implemented) and Tamil Nadu (which is the forerunner of the scheme). From the success lessons learnt from Tamil Nadu the experiential sharing from the two states is suggestive of certain measures for modifying the current policies and practices for the betterment of the MDM scheme in Uttarakhand. The implication of the study highlights that apart from the funds and guidelines provided for the scheme, it is equally important to focus on the attitude and involvement of the beneficiaries and functionaries for the success of the MDM scheme across the country. Adapted from the source document.

Family Dynamics of People Living With HIV/AIDS

Author: P.J., Lizy1; M., Geetha; Joseph, Shinu1 Department of Social Work, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, Kalamassery, Kerala

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767512?accountid=14925

Abstract: HIV/AIDS is a chronic illness with a long-term, incapacitating, stigmatising and devastating effect on infected individuals, affected families and the community at large. The study explores various aspects of family dynamics of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) such as, communication among the family members, cohesion and their social support, and also the discrimination experienced by them. This study was conducted by collecting data from 60 PLHA, registered under three care centres in Kerala. The data was collected by administering an interview schedule and through focus group discussions. From the analysis it is clear that PLHA and their families have poor communication cohesion, receive inadequate social support and also experience discrimination. These can be tackled by adopting an integrated approach, applying social work methods at personal, familial and community levels. While building capacity among PLHA to cope with their personal problems, family intervention programmes should be used to increase family interaction, mutual support and enrichment. This will automatically lead to good communication and cohesion among the family members. Community care and support through networks of PLHA and organisations working in this field, is an essential and irreplaceable part of fighting discrimination and supporting PLHA and their families. Adapted from the source document.

Rural, Rurality, Caste and Tribes: The Dalit and Tribe Centered Social Work Rural Practicum

Author: S.R., Bodhi11 Centre for Social Justice and Governance, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767517?accountid=14925

Abstract: What is Rural Practicum and what constitutes Rural Practicum? What are the elements that help sharpen the practicum process? How is the Rural Practicum located within the framework of the larger social work programme? How does one organise a practicum within a perspective? What are the components that go into the training of social work personnel to fulfill the criterion envisioned for their role in the community? (in this case -- Dalit and Tribe Centered Social Work) What are the theoretical and practical components of the Rural Practicum? Which pedagogy should one employ to engage the students in Rural Practicum? How does one identify and allot field assignments that will strengthen the process, insert rigour and reinforce seriousness of purpose in students? This note tries to reflect on these questions by critically engaging with the notion, content and process of 'Rural Practicum' in social work education. It expounds through the personal experiences of the educator, drawn from teaching a course related to the Rural Practicum; the various facets of pedagogy and the dynamics of locating the course within social work training. Adapted from the source document.

Journey with Communities: Engagement with SHGs from Lower Income Neighbourhoods in Visakhapatnam

Author: Vijayalakshmi, B1; Prasad, Devi B; Bhavani, Vijaya P.S.; Haranath, S1 Department of Social Work, Andhra University, Visakhapatnam

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881469617?accountid=14925

Abstract: Academic and research institutions have been carrying out action research projects of important development initiatives to demonstrate and draw conclusions from such efforts. A few experiments promoting and working with Self-Help Groups (SHGs) from among poorer sections did yield interesting insights. Shylendra (1998) reported the experiences of the Spearhead Team from the Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA) in promoting eight women's SHGs from Bidaj village (Kheda district) during 1994-1996. He identified three main reasons for the failure of SHGs to become stable and make any significant impact on the socioeconomic life of women: (i) wrong approach in the formation of SHGs; (ii) misconceptions about the goals of SHGs among both the members and the team; and (iii) failure in ensuring conditions necessary for their successful functioning. Reddy (2002) described the experiences of the Women's Development Society (WDS) (a network organization promoted by the National Institute of Rural Development [NIRD], Hyderabad) for the promotion of 80 SHGs in Rangareddy district over a period of one decade (1990-2000). This action research project demonstrated that micro credit, skill development and awareness building of SHG members (as facilitated by the NIRD-WDS project team) were critical components in the project's success in creating a discernible impact on the lives of women. The present article is based on one such field action project initiated by a team of social work professionals from the Department of Social Work (DSW), Andhra University, with the assistance from University Grants Commission (UGC) under the Departmental Research Support (DRS) Programme. Adapted from the source document.

Feminisation of Invisibility and the Politics of Presence: Samatha SHGs in the Peoples' Planning Campaign of Kerala

Author: Bharathy, Manjula11 Centre for Media and Cultural Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881469620?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, an attempt is made to contextualise the historicity of women development approaches in India, with particular reference to Kerala. The notion of the Kerala development model was deconstructed from a gender perspective where -- to a large extent -- women were marginalised politically, socially and economically. Further, an attempt was made to understand the Peoples' Planning Campaign (PPC) process and the conscious gender interventions carried out in the PPC. This is followed by a critique of the SHG intervention and how the PPC had engaged with the ideological notions of the SHGs to challenge the feminisation of invisibility and the culture of silence among women in Kerala. An attempt is also made to throw light on the impact of SHGs in bringing about increased levels of participation, social awareness and confidence among SHG women members. Adapted from the source document.

Beyond Microfinance: The VMSS Way

Author: Prasad, Devi B1; Rani, Indira N; Haranath, S1 Centre for Social Studies, Surat, Gujarat

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881467245?accountid=14925

Abstract: The SHG programmes of Visakha Mahila Seva Sangham (VMSS) combined both microfinance and social development approaches to help poor women. The VMSS, an all-women's organisation run and managed by women, has currently over 205 SHGs in 13 clusters with 3,716 women members spread across five sectors covering eight geographical areas in Arilova, Visakhapatnam. Working through SHGs, the VMSS developed financial services tailored to the needs of the poorest women in the neighbourhood and instilled among them a systematic habit of saving. Going beyond the mere microfinance approach, this model developed women's groups that could work toward the betterment of their members and social development of their communities. Thus, as a unique development finance institution, the VMSS has effectively combined both outreach and sustainability, and incorporated development orientation in the provision of microfinance services to poor women. This article presents the working model of the VMSS, its products, administration and governance mechanisms. A SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis is used to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the systems, and the impact of the programmes on the women is ascertained, using participatory methods of investigation such as focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding SHGs in the Light of Social Capital Theorisation

Author: Malathi, A11 Department of Social Work, University of Delhi, Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881467257?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social capital literature is replete with concepts of networks, norms and trust that are required for group effectivity. In this article, these very concepts are explored in the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh and are based on an empirical study of SHGs connected to a fruit processing enterprise. It is argued that achievements and challenges cannot be explained by simply using efficiency or motivational models; instead, they should be located in the life-worlds of the members. The significance of social capital in explaining these processes is highlighted, in addition to suggesting interventions. Adapted from the source document.

Role of NGOs in Promoting and Strengthening SHGs

Author: D'souza, Supriya11 Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881467267?accountid=14925

Abstract: In India, the engagement of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as partners with the government in development programmes was envisaged and introduced during the Eighth Five Year Plan. The involvement of NGOs with SHGs as self-help groups promoting institutions (SHPIs) is a result of such an understanding. However, this engagement of NGOs with SHGs is beset with many dilemmas. The Government of India, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and most funding partners working with SHGs are of the opinion that engagement of NGOs with groups can only be for 2-3 years and thus are funded accordingly. However, in reality, to undergo the whole process of sustainability and achieve self-reliance, SHGs need a minimum period of five years of hand holding by the SHPIs. For the success and sustainability of the SHG movement, the role of NGOs is crucial. Therefore, the present donor system that restricts and limits the role as well as involvement of the NGOs on SHPIs needs to be reviewed. It is in this context, that article makes an effort to take a comprehensive look at the role of NGOs, while working with SHGs and the challenges faced. Adapted from the source document.

Notes From The Field: Are Banks Inclusive of the Poor?

Author: Departmental Research Support Team11 Department of Social Work, Andhra University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881459708?accountid=14925

Abstract: It has been observed in the past that the government and banks highlight SHGs as collectives used for financial inclusion. Even the money distributed to these groups has been impressive. However, it is important to understand the process of loan acquisition. In this light, the process of obtaining a bank loan by the three SHGs promoted by the Department of Social Work, Andhra University, has been closely documented. The following account illustrates the difficulties encountered by poor women members of the Gullalapalem SHG, despite support from the Department, to obtain a small loan of Rupees 12,000 from a public sector bank (where they have an account), to purchase sewing machines to make adda leaf plates (adda are large flat leaves that can be stitched together and used as disposable plates). Adapted from the source document.

Genealogy Of The Lone Parent

Author: Chan, Kam Wah1; Chan, Fung Yi1 Department of Applied Social Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Hung Hom, Kowloon Hong Kong sskwchan@polyu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881467230?accountid=14925

Abstract: Lone parent families are often portrayed as welfare-dependent, and social policies and social services can be hostile to and discriminating against lone parents especially in societies dominated by traditional familism, such as Hong Kong. This resentment of lone parent families has not been present throughout Hong Kong's history, but has arisen over the past decade. This paper is based on a study that traced the changing discourses of the lone parent family in Hong Kong. Adopting the Foucauldian concept of genealogy of knowledge and inspired by Nancy Fraser and Linda Gordon's work on "genealogy of dependency", we trace the discourses of the lone parent family from the 1970s to the early 21st century. The term "lone parent" did not exist before the mid-1980s, and when it first appeared it was closely associated with vulnerability and charity. In the early 21st century, the lone parent discourse developed into a problematic discourse, with lone parents associated with welfare dependency, social security fraud, juvenile delinquency, family violence, and perceived as a threat to social stability. This paper notes that the "success" of this discourse may help to rationalize the cutting back of social security benefits for lone mothers and regulate welfare recipients. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article examines why social work is called by its name and what the "social" of social work is. The review of the development of social work has found that social work practice has put more emphasis on individual treatment and clinical therapies, and has increasingly neglected the aim of advancing social change, social reform and social justice. This article aims to discuss if social work only focuses on individual change and treatment, should it be still called by this name? Social work should also focus on its social goals. The social work profession needs to revive its social goals and identify the meaning of its social nature. This article begins with discussing the trend of therapeutisation of social work and the reasons behind, then examines the importance of realigning the profession with its social nature and identifies the six social dimensions of social work. It suggests how to promote the understanding of the social of social work and the achievement of its social goals with regard to the aspects of social work practice, the development of the social work profession and social work education.

Police Work With Youth-At-Risk: What Can Social Work Contribute?

Author: Chun, Roxco P.K.1; Chui, Y H; Chan, Y C; Cheng, Howard C.H.1 Department of Applied Social Sciences, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881469611?accountid=14925

Abstract: While traditional policing focuses on crime control by law enforcement, the Hong Kong Police Force has increasingly affirmed the importance of multi-agency collaboration and service-orientation in their work. The change provides impetus for venturing on more innovative training for police. The Police Attachment to NGOs Program is an unprecedented tailor-made multi-agency training program for serving police officers in Hong Kong. A series of these training programs were commissioned to the Department of Applied Social Sciences of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. So far, seven rounds of training have been completed. The program consisted of three phases -- the pre-attachment induction phase, the attachment phase and the post-attachment deepening phase. The trainees were provided with opportunities to dialog with the social workers and youth-at-risk directly, an experience evaluated by the trainees as stimulating and rewarding. The program also generated benefits to the social workers and the service users of the NGOs because they both could gain better understanding of the police mindset, their work and difficulties. This paper discusses what social work can contribute in police training, including the design of the program, its implementation, and evaluation of its effect. In a way, the training can be regarded as an indirect social work practice from which both the young people and the society can benefit. Since the trained police officers can avoid stereotyping the youth-at-risk and have better collaboration with social workers, this training is able to enhance police work with youth-at-risk.

Impacts Of Adventure-Based Counseling Training On The Young Olds

Author: Lee, Francis W.L.1; Choi, J.K.Y.1 Department of Social Work and Social Administration, University of Hong Kong fwllee@hkucc.hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881469614?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is commonly believed that Adventure-based Counseling (ABC) training is intended for young people who are active and energetic. The St. James' Settlement (an NGO) in Hong Kong, however, believes that such training can also have positive effects on the young olds (individuals aged 50-65). A group of young old trainees was recruited from the community to help implement related activities to elderly members of this NGO. Their general health condition, levels of life satisfaction, optimism, and self-efficacy were measured before and after the training, and a control group was also recruited. The results show that the ABC training had significant impacts on the life satisfaction, optimism, and self-efficacy levels of the young old trainees. Recommendations are made at the end of the paper. Adapted from the source document.

Trauma From Sexual Abuse: The Untold Story Of Male Victims In Hong Kong

Author: Chan, Simon T.M.11 Department of Social Work, Hong Kong Baptist University simon@hkbu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881469615?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Asian societies, the sexual abuse experiences of male victims are rarely studied due to social gender role stereotype, which enforces the discourse that men are supposed to be tough and impossible to be hurt, and not to report sexual abuse. This research examines the life journey of 12 sexually abused male survivors in Hong Kong to explore their struggles. Results show: firstly, male survivors are caught in shame and excitement when talking about their abusive incidents. Shamefulness leads some of them to have negative self-esteem while excitement makes some of them addicted to sexual activities or even become homosexual; secondly, they feel insecure to tell others about it after being abused, because of masculinity identity; thirdly, relationship building is always hard for them since they do not know how to maintain distance with the others. Adapted from the source document.

Social Support and Marital Quality Among Wives of Persons with Alcohol Dependence

Author: Vijayan, T V11 Madras Institute of Development Studies, Chennai, Tamil Nadu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856407200?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present research was undertaken to study the socio-demographic details of persons with alcohol dependence and their wives; to study the social support of wives of persons with alcohol dependence; to assess the marital quality of wives of persons with alcohol dependence; and to understand the relationship between social support and marital quality of wives of persons with alcohol dependence. A descriptive research design was adopted and the wives of 40 persons with alcohol dependence, who were admitted in the in-patient unit of the De-addiction Centre of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, were selected as sample. Data was collected by administering the Personal and Socio-Demographic Information Schedule developed by the researcher, Social Support Appraisals (SS-A) Scale (Vaux and others, 1986) and Marital Quality Scale (Shah, 1995). The statistical tests used for the analysis of data were mean, median, mode, standard deviation, range and Carl Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that higher levels of social support are associated with better quality of marital life, which implies a significant role of therapeutic services to ensure enhancement of social support and marital quality.

Legal Framework for Children in Conflict with Law in India: Problems and Prospects

Author: Sharma, Renu11 College of Social Work, Nirmala Niketan, Mumbai, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856407363?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, is the main legislation which provides a legal framework for children in the country. This legislation is a move towards inclusion and mainstreaming, getting children's participation and finding alternatives in the form of family- and community-based care for these children. This article highlights certain inherent limitations of the Act along with administrative bottlenecks faced while implementing it. The article, however, limits its focus to the children in conflict with law only and also highlights the initiatives taken up at various levels to bring significant changes in the juvenile justice system. Adapted from the source document.

Research as Social Work: Participatory Research on the Status of Dalits in India

Author: Janagan, J Emmanuel1; Patil, Keshao1 Department of Social Welfare, University of Malaya, Malaysia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856406595?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work literature has already made links between social work and research, and has argued in favour of practitioner-research. This article turns the argument around and looks at how research can come to look and feel like social work. This happens particularly, but not exclusively, in participatory research on the status of dalits, especially in an auto ethnographic or life-story research, where long-term research relationships are more in evidence. Drawing from literature on participatory research methodology and the author's own oral and life-history research, this article explores areas in which research comes to emulate social work practice. Adapted from the source document.

Objective Helping, Hegel and Three Indian Reformers in Colonial Civil Society: Prefacing the Personalytical History of Social Work

Author: Chatterjee, Arnab11 Law Coll Durgapur, West Bengal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/818793123?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this article is to propose a theoretical matrix by which the transition from personally inscribed, pre-modern forms of helping may be compared to the new forms of impersonal helping in modernity -- colonial modernity in particular. The article narrates how Hegel had historically & philosophically theorised, for the first time, such an objective helping to replace personalistic, arbitrary helping & proposed the mediating institutions of civil society to order this transition. But the tragedy this praxis encountered has been missed out by social work or other helping historians. The fate of such a failed hunt for the impersonal-universal in nineteenth century colonial Bengal (or colonial civil society) is examined in the article through the texts of three prominent Indian reformers & their institutional tracts. The personal principle seems to have run riot & earned a decisive victory over its closest opposite. The article also aims to initiate, a personalytical interpretation of social work or helping histories where the impersonal, objective modern foundations of early social work (& its organisational principle) are discovered to have been secretly belied by a 'whimsical', 'transitory', 'arbitrary' & tyrannical principle of the natural-personal &/or the personality of the institution. Consequentially, the exemplarity of such reform movements & their iconic emplacement in social work histories is challenged. The article militates against all existing histories of Indian social work & urges major substantive & methodological revisions. Adapted from the source document.

Functioning of Janani Suraksha Yojana in Hassan District of Karnataka

Author: Mutharayappa, R11 Population Research Centre, Instit for Social & Economic Change, Bengaluru, Karnataka

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/818793783?accountid=14925

Abstract: The main objective of the study was to evaluate the Janani Suraksha Yojana, an innovative scheme for pregnant women, under the National Rural Health Mission. The study was conducted in the Hassan District of Karnataka in 1,200 households spread over 24 villages. Findings of the study reveal that institutional deliveries had increased, along with knowledge of family planning methods & utilisation of government health services. The study suggests that while these are encouraging signs, promotion of institutional deliveries needs to be sustained in order to reduce peri-natal & neo-natal mortality rates. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The empowerment needs of tribal women in India have not yet received adequate scholarly attention. Hence, the problem of the present study was conceptualised within the three component model of women empowerment proposed by Amin, Becker & Bayes (1998). Along with the level of empowerment of tribal women, severity of difficulties & dissatisfactions in social life & quality of community life were measured. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted to complement quantitative results. The results showed that the overall score on empowerment measures was substantially low (M=9.9; SD=3.9). Consistent with this, qualitative findings showed similar trends in the experiential aspect of tribal women's empowerment needs at different levels. No significant difficulties or dissatisfactions were reported in the various domains of social life, except in work. Better quality of community life was reported (M=80.5; SD=f 7.7). The overall results reiterate the critical role of empowerment initiatives for better satisfaction & fewer difficulties in community life of tribal women. Adapted from the source document.

Establishing The Well-Being Of The Rural-Urban Elderly Population: A Case Study Of Indonesia

Author: Mohd, Saidatulakmal1; Azman, Azlinda; Sulaiman, Jamalludin; Baba, Ismail1 School of Social Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887497110?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study determines and compares the influence of various demographic factors in achieving well-being of the elderly population in the rural and urban areas in Indonesia. Age, marital status, social class, perceived health and economic condition are some of the main contributing factors in measuring well-being. In addition, social aspects such as living and familial arrangement were also investigated to establish elderly population well being. Data were collected using a survey-interview method. A total of 157 elderly in the urban areas and 145 elderly in the rural areas were surveyed. A causal model of well-being was employed to analyse the data obtained. The model of well-being was then tested using path analysis to test the causal relationships among the variables. Although the study indicated that there was no significant difference of well-being between the rural and urban elderly, the social support variables generally help improve the well-being of the elderly population. Adapted from the source document.

Microfinance And Poverty Alleviation In Bangladesh: Perspective From Social Work

Author: Ali, Isahaque1; Hatta, Zulkarnain A1 Rajshahi University, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887497114?accountid=14925

Abstract: Poverty alleviation has been a perpetual challenge to the contemporary world. Bangladesh is one of the world's poorest countries and about 45% of the total population are living below the poverty line. It is vital for Bangladesh to re-evaluate its policy on poverty alleviation in which microfinance has been a crucial element. Microfinance is now being recognised as one of the most impetus and effective mechanisms for poverty alleviation. Poverty leads to many problems in the society. Lack of access to education, family disintegration, poor quality of life, lower health status, unavailability of safe water, lack of sanitation, and absence of social life, are the major effects of poverty. It is the contention of this paper that social work by acquiring a community development role can help microfinance policy makers develop new policy or reverse existing policy for poverty alleviation in Bangladesh. Social work can also influence actors involved in the field of poverty alleviation from local and international humanity institutions or organisations to adopt new findings to minimise the issues of poverty.

Perceptions of Professional Intervention by Parental Advocates for Autistic Children: A Need to Improve Practice with Self-help Groups and Those with Developmental Disabilities

Author: Carter, Irene

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714151?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent budget constraints on government social welfare spending have resulted in increases in the activity levels of self-help groups for those suffering from autism. Currently, some self-help groups for children with developmental disabilities propose social policy initiatives that would increase the ability of social welfare programs to meet their needs, which would benefit society as a whole. Historically, support groups, assisted by a larger organization, involved social workers while self-help groups, independent of professionals, promoted change. However, self-help groups and support groups have common characteristics. The author's study of 22 parental advocates of children with autism in the Greater Toronto Area has revealed several unmet needs and sources of frustration with regard to governmental support for developmental disabilities, self-help group dynamics, and parental experiences with professionals. Referring to key findings in this study, the author will survey the literature in order to examine relevant issues more deeply and to come up with suggestions for possible solutions. An outline of suggestions will be made regarding ways in which professionals could more effectively support families touched by a member with a disability as well as support for the self-help groups in which they are involved. Adapted from the source document.

Quality of Service Perceptions Among Service Providers in Texas

Author: Held, Mary Lehman; Alawiyah, Tuti; Streeter, Calvin L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714094?accountid=14925

Abstract: Human service organizations face increasing expectations for providing high quality services. While numerous barriers pose challenges to meeting this expectation, many factors within an organizations control affect employee and consumer perceptions of the quality of services being provided. This paper aims to fill this gap by assessing the relationship between worker accommodations, employment development, team effectiveness, and employee satisfaction and perceptions of service quality among providers in public human service agencies in Texas. The results indicated that team effectiveness and employee satisfaction made the largest unique contributions. In addition, age became a significant predictor in the second step when the independent variables were added to the model. Worker accommodations and employment development were not significant predictors in the regression model. Adapted from the source document.

Rural Social Workers' Priorities for Professional Development: Using an Exploratory Survey as Assessment

Author: Conley, Timothy B; Murphy, Colleen; Ewan, Melissa; Stoeckel, Elisabeth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714076?accountid=14925

Abstract: A survey of social workers in a rural, western state was conducted to assess their priorities for professional development. Research questions were conceptualized to determine which issues are most important to members of the state's chapter of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), including overall perceptions of NASW and suggestions for additional professional development opportunities. The response rate of 1,001 current, past, and potential NASW members surveyed was 49.2 percent, though 62 percent of the current NASW membership responded. All respondents identified advocacy and education as the priorities for professional development opportunities through the state chapter. Adapted from the source document.

Promoting Supervisory Development in Child Welfare: Utilization of 360-Degree Evaluation

Author: Collins-Camargo, Crystal E; Sullivan, Dana J; Murphy, April L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714099?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a professional development initiative designed to improve casework supervision in one state's child welfare agency. The 360-degree evaluation process was implemented by having supervisors and managers evaluated by direct reports, peers, managers, and themselves. A mixed-methods design was selected that incorporated both an electronic survey and focus groups. The findings suggest a wide variety of experiences with and perceptions of the process, as well as behavior change in supervisory practices. This project represents a first step in documenting the potential use of processes such as the 360-degree evaluation to promote practice change and systematic improvement as part of the development of a learning organization in human services. Adapted from the source document.

Retention of Title IV-E and Non-Title IV-E Child Protective Service Practitioners

Author: Leung, Patrick; Brown, Karen; Chavkin, Nancy; Fong, Rowena; Urwin, Charlene

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714081?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study conducted in a southwestern state with BSW and MSW Title IV-E (n=350) and non-Title IV-E (n=350) public child welfare practitioners affirms and expands the literature about why practitioners choose to stay and why they choose to leave the public child welfare system. The findings add new knowledge about retention of public child welfare practitioners who have received professional development by participating in Title IV-E professional education. Specific research questions of this study are related to (1) primary reasons for staying at Child Protective Services (CPS) after initial employment; (2) potential reasons for leaving CPS; and (3) motivating factors for continuously working at CPS.

Service Learning and Millennial Students: Benefits and Challenges to a Team-Based Approach

Author: Williams, Patricia Hrusa; Falk, Audrey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714157?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study examines millennial students' perceptions of the benefits and challenges of a team-based service learning course. The study was conducted in a Family Studies department within a comprehensive, metropolitan university in the U.S. Open-ended responses to exit interviews with graduating seniors were analyzed. Results indicated that students appreciated the opportunity to engage in hands-on, real-world experience. They both liked and were challenged by the team aspect of their service learning projects. The authors suggest that consideration of student and site characteristics can optimize benefits of service learning for both parties. Adapted from the source document.

Building Trust and Solidarity with Campus Policing: Interventions for Social Capital

Author: Landuyt, Noel; Lauderdale, Michael; Montgomery, Katherine; Dahlstrom, Robert; Lein, Laura; Springer, David; Bell, Holly; Chang, Beth Bruinsma

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714167?accountid=14925

Abstract: The appropriate role of the police officer and his or her relations with citizens has changed over several decades. Those roles and relations are especially critical in college situations; the University of Texas at Austin has had concerns for many years going back at least to the Whitman shooting in 1967 on the need for uniformed officers. In more recent years, there have been concerns regarding officer conduct and questioning if instances of racial profiling existed. To secure empirical information about contacts and relations with University of Texas at Austin Police Department (UTPD) and the citizens on the University campus, the UTPD Oversight Committee arranged to have University researchers with experience in these areas conduct a study of the University's officers and their contacts. The study consists of three parts. The first two parts are 1) field observational studies that report information on how officers go about their assigned duties and 2) interviews of persons that have been stopped by officers. The third part is an internet-based assessment of the experiences citizens have had after an encounter with an officer. The study began in November of 2008 and is ongoing (as of publication date). The findings are that of a broad and diverse group of citizens on campus including students, faculty, staff and visitors. Findings show that night experiences are very different from day experiences and strong seasonal patterns appear as well. There was no finding of a systematic bias of officers toward any particular group and one overall conclusion is that citizens view UTPD officers as well-trained, responsive and courteous.

Social Policy Advocacy Evaluation: A More Complete Model for Social Work

Author: Cochran, Gerald

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714088?accountid=14925

Abstract: As a master's level social worker, my research training focused on evaluation methods for professional practice. However, when I began working as a children's public health policy analyst and advocate, I was surprised when I attended a national training on evaluating policy advocacy in which the presenters discussed the professional community's struggle to measure policy advocacy interventions. It was then I decided to synthesize a model which could be easily applied by policy advocates -- in particular those within the social work profession -- to evaluate their professional practice of policy advocacy intervention.

Efficacy of One-day Trainings as They Relate to Mental Health Clinicians

Author: Dlugosz, John; Koons, Jessica

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714132?accountid=14925

Abstract: This review critically analyzes selected published works on the topic of one-day trainings as they concern training clinicians who work in the human service sector. The focus of this review is to provide a foundation to further legitimize one-day trainings specifically for human services providers, and to provide a general overview of the success of this type of training approach. Additionally, this review will examine the underpinnings of the one-day training structure and present some of the reasoning behind the push for one-day trainings. Adapted from the source document.

Educating Social Workers on Child Neglect: A Multi-Dimensional Framework

Author: Bundy-Fazioli, Kim; Hamilton, Tobi A. DeLong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714090?accountid=14925

Abstract: Generalist social work educators have the task of ensuring that social work students are adequately prepared for the workforce. In 2006, the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated 282,000 social workers were employed as child, family, and school social workers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also estimates that the number of child, family, and school social workers will grow faster than the average (19%) of all other occupations. Given the fact that a large percentage of graduating social workers nationwide will enter into the child welfare workforce, we advocate that curriculum time and attention be given to educating students about child neglect. Also we argue that child welfare workers are not the only ones who should be familiar with assessing for child neglect. The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a rationale for educating social workers in the area of child neglect and to propose a multidimensional framework for assessment within the social work curriculum. Adapted from the source document.

Caregiving Roles of Co-Resident Grandmothers in Three Generational Households

Author: Mulder, Cray

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714138?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article considers the phenomenon of grandparent caregiving within three generational households through a theoretical lens of role theory, and from the perspectives of co-resident adolescent mothers and their mothers. Twenty-six pairs of household members described grandmother caregiving experiences during in-depth qualitative interviews. Grandmother caregiving roles varied from nearly co-parent status to relationships with clear boundaries. In addition, grandmothers were frequently identified as family matriarchs, teachers, and role models. Role strains resulted from emotional, physical, and financial caregiving for co-resident grandchildren. Close relationships and good health facilitated role enhancement among grandmother caregivers. Adapted from the source document.

Child Welfare Supervisors -- "Stuck in the Middle": The Impact of Middle Management Status

Author: Austbrooks, Angela

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714172?accountid=14925

Abstract: Staff turnover rates in child welfare have been the focus of research for several decades (Arches, 1991; Baumann, Kern, McFadden, & Law, 1997; Ellett, Ellett, & Rugutt, 2003; Fox, Miller, & Barbee, 2003; Maceachron, Gustavsson, Lavitt, & Bartle, 2009; Morris, 2005). However, the impact of organizational climate on the crucial role of child welfare supervisors has scarcely been explored. A qualitative study was conducted with 50 child welfare supervisors to determine aspects of the organizational climate that contributed to employment longevity. Results of the study indicate that supervisors experience high levels of dissatisfaction with the agency related to their middle-management status and perceived lack of power. In addition, supervisors whose personal mission was synonymous with the agency mission were more likely to remain employed. These findings are discussed as well as implications for child welfare and social work education. Adapted from the source document.

A Survey of Continuing Education Programs Conducted by Professional Development: The International Journal of Continuing Social Work Education

Author: Cochran, Gerald; Landuyt, Noel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714143?accountid=14925

Abstract: The needs of individuals and the most effective ways that can be used to help them are constantly evolving. Therefore, social workers involved in helping efforts must continually be engaged in learning and education to stay informed. In order to accomplish this, continuing education (CE) is an integral part of the social work profession. As a result of the importance of continuing social work education for professional practice, states and provinces, through governmental authority, have made obtaining CE hours a requirement for maintaining professional competency and skills. However, CE requirements and administration are operated on a location-by-location basis. As a result of this reality, there are different jurisdictions and little connection or coordination in CE program information. A first step in increasing this coordination and communication is to gather information from the various CE programs. The collection and dissemination of programmatic information would act as a benchmark and a resource for CE program directors, program administrators, and the broader social services community. Also such data would operate as an impetus in shaping future collaboration between programs, which has the potential to improve the overall quality and effectiveness of CE programs. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: In recent decades, children's rights have attracted special notice from social work, largely due to the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 (UNCRC). Children's rights were included, under a broader umbrella of human rights, in the 2000 revised definition of social work, stating that "principles of human rights and social justice are fundamental to social work" (IFSW, 2002). Because of the importance of human and children's rights for social work, Hare (2004: 416) claimed that social work can be considered as a "human rights profession". Children's rights, in particular, are increasingly regarded as a frame of reference for social work, where they are considered to be a key lever for commitment in the social work practice (Roose & De Bie, 2008). In contrast to the great weight given to the children's rights framework in social work, the relationship between social work practices and children's rights education receives very little attention, this despite some landmark initiatives from the mid-1990s onwards, when children's and human rights education were placed on the international agenda. In 1994, the United Nations declared the 'Decade for Human Rights Education' (1995-2004), which was succeeded by the 'World Programme for Human Rights Education' (2005-ongoing). The aim of these initiatives was to urge governments and civil society organisations to develop activities in order to implement the 'human and children's rights agenda'. Social work was held to redound to this agenda, e.g. the development of training manuals for human rights education (Centre for Human Rights, 1994) and children's rights education (IFSW, 2002). However, the relation between social work practices, on the one hand, and children's rights education, on the other, still remains quite unclear. Linking both concepts raises the question whether children's rights education should be considered as a distinct practice in the broad field of social work practices? If so, then what characterizes this practice? Or should children's rights education be considered as a learning process that makes part of every social work practice involving children that strives towards greater respect for the human dignity of children? Although dominant conceptualisations tie in with the former interpretation, in this paper we argue for the latter understanding of children's rights education. Adapted from the source document.

Re-Examining Relationships Between Experience, Knowledge, Ideas and Research: A Key Role for Recipients of State Welfare and Their Movements

Author: Beresford, Peter11 Brunel University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114263?accountid=14925

Abstract: The focus of this paper is the emergence of new understandings and paradigms of care and support and their implications for mainstream policies, services and professions. These have major implications for social work, which is a profession particularly concerned with issues of care and support. What distinguishes these new approaches is that they come from people with direct experience of such care and support. They are associated with the new movements of service users which over the last 20 to 30 years have developed internationally, in both the west and the majority world. These movements and their organisations - of disabled people, older people, mental health service users/survivors, people with learning difficulties and others - have developed in different ways and at varying paces in different countries and settings. However, what they have in common, is that their discourses and critiques are crucially informed by their lived experience on the receiving end of such policies and provision and their shared identities as 'service users'. In some countries, including the UK, they have begun to have an impact on legislation, policy, politics and even popular culture. It is the new ideas from service users, the experiential knowledge which they are based upon and the issues these have raised and the ramifications they have, which this article explores. The emergence and engagement of these 'service user' perspectives represents a major departure from the development of care and support services historically, where other perspectives and sources of knowledge and 'expertise' have traditionally been prioritised. The discussion here is concerned with the implications of this involvement of service users for the economics, planning, policy, and practice of care and support. But it focuses particularly on the ramifications of the experiential knowledge of service users and service user research for the conceptualisation, theory-building, knowledge base, research and evaluation of care and support. This has particular relevance to social work where work on the involvement of service users in policy, practice, learning and research is especially advanced and has gained considerable international interest.

Positioning Social Work in a Socially Sensitive Society

Author: van Ewijk, Hans11 University for Humanistics (UvH) and University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (HU)

Abstract: As a practitioner, a manager and a scientist in social work for 40 years, I am still intrigued by the social work positioning and legitimating processes. Its recognition by users and financiers is often diffuse and its fragmentation sometimes hinders effective interventions. In social work itself, we see a range of positioning processes, most of them either legitimating social work as a promoter of social justice, a supporter of emancipation and anti-oppressive practice, or positioning social work as a therapeutic approach, treating people with socio-psychological and psychiatric disorders. Social work is often promoted as a 'real' profession, in need of formal recognition and in need of a precise profile. In this article it will be argued that the core of social work is about supporting people in their social functioning and should position itself in the centre of the post-modern quest: the social-psychological disorientation, the lack of meaning, and the problems of isolation and exclusion. Modern professionalism is not about demarcating and regulating but much more about 'Entgrenzung' and openness. Adapted from the source document.

People with Disabilities and the Role of Social Workers in Lesotho

Author: Chitereka, Christopher11 Department of Anthropology, Sociology and Social Work, The National University of Lesotho, Southern Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114272?accountid=14925

Abstract: Some of the most vulnerable members of society the world over include the elderly, children, women and people with disabilities (PWDs). The latter group usually faces serious problems emanating from society's negative attitudes towards PWDs. According to African Decade 1 (2005) there are more than 600 million people with disabilities worldwide and 180 million are children, 400 million live in developing countries and 80 million in Africa. This paper examines the situation of people with disabilities in Lesotho. It argues that although Lesotho is a signatory to many international conventions and treaties such as the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights; United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women among others, it still does not have specific legislation on disability. This often results in the plight of PWDs not being adequately addressed in many spheres of their lives. The paper provides insights into the roles of social workers in dealing with PWDs in Lesotho. Adapted from the source document.

The Increasing Importance of Administrative Practices in the Shaping of the Welfare State

Author: Blomberg, Staffan1; Petersson, Jan1 School of Social Work, Lund University, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114454?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article we analyse changes in the Swedish welfare state through the example of the municipal social care services for older persons. It is shown that one can trace a transformation to three different processes (layers) of change. When looked upon as complementary phenomena they show why and how administrative practices have become the dominant locus in the re-shaping of the welfare state. The incorporation of managerialism as the prevailing mode for delivering the services and organizing social policy leads to the main conclusion, that we are witnessing the move away from a moral/political to an administrative welfare regime. In the ending paragraph, we argue that this move weakens social citizenship and transfers values and principles in social policy to the administrative sphere. We further argue that this focus has some broader implications in characterizing and analyzing cross-national differences as to welfare regimes. Adapted from the source document.

Beyond the Pro and Contra of Evidence-Based Practice: Reflections on a Recurring Dilemma at the Core of Social Work

Author: Nothdurfter, Urban11 Free University of Bozen/Bolzano

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114051?accountid=14925

Abstract: Currently, social work is witnessing a quite polarized debate about what should be the basis for good practice. Simply stated, the different attempts to define the required basis for effective and accountable interventions in social work practice can be grouped in two paradigmatic positions, which seem to be in strong opposition to each other. On the one hand the highly influential evidence based practice movement highlights the necessity to base practice interventions on proven effectiveness from empirical research. Despite some variations, such as between narrow conceptions of evidence based practice (see e.g. McNeece/Thyer, 2004) and broader approaches to it (see e.g. Gambrill, 1999, 2001, 2008), the evidence based practice movement embodies a positivist orientation and more explicitly scientific aspirations of social work by using positivistic empirical strategies. Critics of the evidence based practice movement argue that its narrow epistemological assumptions are not appropriate for the understanding of social phenomena and that evidence based guidelines to practice are insufficient to deal with the extremely complex activities social work practice requires in different and always somewhat unique practice situations (Webb, 2001; Gray & Mc Donald, 2006; Otto, Polutta &Ziegler, 2009). Furthermore critics of evidence based practice argue that it privileges an uncritical and a-political positivism which seems highly problematic in the current climate of welfare state reforms, in which the question 'what works' is highly politicized and the legitimacy of professional social work practice is being challenged maybe more than ever before (Kessl, 2009). Both opponents and proponents of evidence based practice argue on the epistemological, the methodological and the ethical level to sustain their point of view and raise fundamental questions about the real nature of social work practice, so that one could get the impression that social work is really at the crossroads between two very different conceptions of social work practice and its further professional development (Stepney, 2009). However, this article is not going to merely rehearse the pro and contra of different positions that are being invoked in the debate about evidence based practice. Instead it aims to go further by identifying the dilemmas underlying these positions which - so it is argued re-emerge in the debate about evidence based practice, but which are older than this debate. They concern the fundamental ambivalence modern professionalization processes in social work were subjected to from their very beginnings. Adapted from the source document.

Historical Consciousness in Youth Work and Adult Education

Author: Lorenz, Walter1; Coussee, Filip; Verschelden, Griet1 Free University of Bozen/Bolzano

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835113992?accountid=14925

Abstract: During the past decades, the fields of youth work and adult education are concerned with questions concerning their identity. Questions that cannot receive a full answer without taking into account our (shared) social and pedagogical histories. For many practitioners, policymakers and researchers the confrontation with our history means a renewed acquaintance with social and pedagogical questions that constitute our field, often in a rather 'natural' way, which means that they are not open for critical inquiry (Heyting, 2001). So, in discovering the past we also hope to renew the 'social pedagogical eye' (Stickelman, 1993) in our work by investigating how pedagogical questions are always related to social problems or broader questions concerning social cohesion. Adapted from the source document.

Decision-Making and Ethical Dilemmas of Child and Family Social Workers

Author: Bertotti, Teresa11 University of Milano Bicocca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114059?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child protection services are characterized by the task of constantly balancing the need of protecting the child and the need to help parents, with the mission in order to achieve a better standard of living for children of evaluating the situations where problems of family life and parental behaviour create risks for children's lives. In their daily work, social workers have to make decisions taking into account different levels of judgement and evaluation, in situations where there is a structural ambivalence and no clear evidence of the 'right way' to act. Viewed from an ethical perspective, this uncertainty raises perennial questions about "what is right" and "what is good" and professional and organizational cultures should contribute to help practitioners in dealing with these dilemmas. In Italy, the child protection 'system' was developed during the 90's, more thanks to a professional movement from the bottom, than to a wide and systematic national child welfare policy. The way to protect children in danger was based on a sort of 'patchwork of rules' that works due to a coherent and collaborative interaction between the Juvenile court and the Welfare system, social and health services; those principles allowed Italy to developed it's child protection system somehow akin to that of other western European countries. In this field, professional decisions about what is in the 'best interest' of the child are influenced to what happens in two macro areas, the organization of Welfare and the legal system which have being characterized by deep changes in the first years of 2000's. The former with cuts in spending, managerialism, subsidiarity, and separation between social and health services, localization. The latter with the demand of 'new' role of Justice related to a liberal view and guaranties for the people involved. Adapted from the source document.

Transnationalism

Author: Kongeter, Stefan11 University of Toronto

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114060?accountid=14925

Abstract: The term "transnationality" is a reference point for research activities in such varied disciplines as anthropology, sociology, political science, geography, economics, history, etc. The field of "transnational studies" (Khagram/Levitt 2008) that has expanded so strongly in the last two decades encompasses a broad range of social phenomena: ranging from transnational migration circuits, families and communities, to transnational practices, identities and citizenship, to transnational networks, social fields, corporations, politics and capital flows. In view of this heterogeneity, Glick Schiller and Levitt (2006: 5) propose a broad definition of transnationality: "The term transnationalism or transnational processes emphasizes the ongoing interconnection or flow of people, ideas, objects, and capital across the borders of nation-states, in contexts in which the state shapes but does not contain such linkages and movements." This (supposed) ubiquity of transnational phenomena (Vertovec 2009: 1) raises the issue of what constitutes the common ground and the specificity of the field of research which falls under this term. The distinction between this concept and the "picture of the nation state as a container, in which a clearly defined territory confines culture, politics, economy, and community" is one of the basic starting points of transnational research. For the fact is that this notion of a (national) space as a container has for a long time prevented one from perceiving and studying practices through which border-crossing social fields are created. Fields of this type arise from continuous migratory movements, resulting not only in the development of transnational identities and lifetime projects but also in a material infrastructure, social institutions, basic political and legal conditions, and much more.

Influential Social Workers: A Preliminary Exploration of Social Work Faculty

Author: Greif, Geoffrey L1; Chaiklin, Harris; Timlin, Stacy1 School of Social Work, University of Maryland, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114482?accountid=14925

Abstract: The profession of social work in the U.S. has been influenced and is being influenced by a wide-range of advocates, politicians, practitioners, and educators. This paper is a preliminary attempt to systematically examine who social work faculty consider influential in shaping the field. Identifying influential social workers is an important step in understanding the history of a profession, its current state, and its future trajectory. Adapted from the source document.

Beyond the Margins: Analyzing Social Exclusion with a Homeless Client Dataset

Author: Ramos, Javier1; Varela, Albert1 e-Democracy Centre, University of Zurich

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114189?accountid=14925

Abstract: A great share of literature on social exclusion has been based mainly on the analysis of official survey data. Whereas these efforts have provided insights into the characteristics and conditions of those people living at the margins of mainstream social relations, they have however failed to encompass those who live beyond these very margins. Meanwhile, research on these hidden subpopulations, such as homeless and other vulnerable groups, remains generally less abundant and is significantly detached from the theoretical core of the debate on social exclusion. The concern about these shortcomings lies at the heart of our research. We seek to bring some light to the area by using data made available by an organization that provides services to people experiencing homelessness in Barcelona (Spain). The data sample contains clients in early stages of exclusion and others in chronic situations. Thus, we attempt to identify some of the variables that operate in preventing the "chronification" of those individuals in situation of social exclusion. Our findings suggest that certain variables such as educational level, income and housing type, which are considered to be central predictors in the analysis of poverty, behave differently when analyzing differences between stages of social exclusion. Although these results cannot be extrapolated to the whole Spanish or European reality, they could provide useful insight for future investigations on this topic. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Practice and Hegemony in the German School to Work Transition System

Author: Humme, Mark11 Munster University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114313?accountid=14925

Abstract: School to work transition in Germany is institutionalised by two thresholds: the first is school to vocational education, and the second vocational educational to employment. This research project focuses on the first threshold, that is, vocational education under the university system. As a backdrop to the study, it is necessary to understand the German school system which qualifying degrees are obtained and access to vocational education is acquired. In Germany there are three main kinds of general schools and accompanying qualifications: 1. Basic Secondary School (Hauptschule) leads to the Certificate of Compulsory Education (Hauptschulabschluss) after five years (nine including primary school). This track typically prepares young people for vocational education. In most cases students complete secondary school by age 15. 2. Middle Secondary School (Realschule) provides a Certificate of higher status after six years (ten in total), with approximate age of completion by 16 years of age. 3. Grammer School (Gymnasium) provides a qualification (Abitur) giving access to higher education after nine (thirteen in total) years. This diploma from German secondary school allows for university admission or matriculation and the university-entrance diploma (Abitur) prepares young people for university education. This is complete by 18 or 19 years. Adapted from the source document.

The Philanthropy Scale: a Sociological Perspective in Measuring New Forms of Pro Social Behaviour

Author: Schuyt, Theo1; Bekkers, Rene; Smit, Jan1 Department of Philanthropic Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, VU University Amsterdam, Netherlands

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114254?accountid=14925

Abstract: In wealthy countries, philanthropy is conspicuous back on stage. It appears in new forms, worldwide. As a result, scholarly attention for philanthropy is growing. Philanthropic goals refer to persons, groups and communities who, in most cases, are not personally known to the giver. In research, however, philanthropic motivations of individuals are usually measured by socio-psychological scales which presuppose direct interactions. Measuring philanthropy could therefore be improved by incorporating a sociological frame of reference as well. As a starting point, this article presents a preliminary version of the philanthropy scale that has been tested in the panel survey of the Giving in the Netherlands (GIN) study. The results are discussed in terms of shortcomings and challenges for further research. Adapted from the source document.

Going Beyond the Bounds of Possibility: Questioning the Delimitation of the Social in Social Work

Author: Roose, Rudi1; Coussee, Filip; Bradt, Lieve1 Ghent University, Department of Social Welfare Studies

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114498?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the late twentieth century, neo-liberal ideologies have put great pressure on European welfare states and on social work that seemed to be forced into a role of managing social exclusion (Scherr, 1999). All European countries, albeit in varying ways, held on to the project of the welfare state through pursuing the transformation of a passive welfare state into an active welfare state. This reframing of the welfare state re-emphasises the moral and pedagogical role of social work (Lorenz, 2001). This evolution revalues the perennial pedagogical tension between emancipation and control as the core of social work. Many social workers, however, feel they lack space to cope with the inherent tensions and paradoxes resulting from this dilemma. They deal with it in very different ways. Some social workers put their hopes in an emerging belief that social work practice could be based more fundamentally on 'evidence'. Others emphasise the need for integrated services and seamless provisions, while still others strive to establish social work as a more recognised profession. All these tendencies imply ambiguity as, on the one hand, potentially the boundaries of social work are broadened out and, on the other hand, new restrictions on social worker's room to move (McDonald and Marston, 2006) are created. The repedagogisation of social work seems to go hand in hand with an individualisation (or desocialisation) of social work practices and theories. The paradoxical nature of discussions all too often leads to sterile debates between believers and non-believers. For this thematic issue we asked some authors to go beyond these yes-no debates and to tap new sources of inspiration by exploring the key question: what is actually the significance of the social in social work? Adapted from the source document.

From Charity to Welfare Rights? A Study of Social Care Practices

Author: Maeseele, Thomas11 Ghent University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114276?accountid=14925

Abstract: In social work a transition is observed from charity and philanthropy to a right to social welfare as the base for social service delivery (Jacobs 1984; Goodin 1988; Harris 2008). After the Second World War, welfare states were developing rapidly and social security systems were introduced (in Belgium, through the social pact of 1944). In Belgium, the public social services developed through successive changes in the legislation. The most important turning points were the adoption of the law on a Basic Minimum Income (BMI) in 1974 and the law on the Public Centres for Social Welfare (PCSW) in 1976. The BMI was the final piece of the social security system (Simoens et al. 2001). In the law on the PCSW, in article 1 it is stated that everyone has the right to social welfare with the aim of guaranteeing that every citizen can live a life in human dignity. In article 57, it is stated that the community is bound to guaranteeing the right to social welfare and that this right has to be ensured by the PCSW. The law of 1976 is characterised by several scholars (Pieters 1980-1981; Luyten 2008) as a Copernican revolution in the perspective on social welfare and as the transition from charity and philanthropy to a right to social welfare in Belgian social welfare provision. Several scholars however criticise the specific translations made of this right and state that charity is still institutionally and ideologically embedded (Notredame 2005). In that vein, Hubeau (1995) states that the current interpretation of this right tends to be minimalistic. Because rights can be interpreted and implemented in different ways (Ife 2001) and because social workers should be considered as policy makers (Lipsky 1980; Evans & Harris 2004; Roose 2006) it is essential to study concrete social practices to gain insight about the actual situation and consequently about the observed and above mentioned transition. A case study about vagrancy is set up with the aim to study whether there was a transition, how this transition was/was not visible in concrete social work practices and what this meant for vagrants. We consider vagrancy as an interesting case in the light of the criminalisation of this social problem until 1993. The decriminalisation movement (e.g. Neirinckx 1989) in the eighties of the previous century based themselves on this right to social welfare to state that the law of 1891 Law to Curb Vagrancy and Mendicancy, under which vagrancy was still criminalised but which replaced the penal sentence by measures, had lost its object. By this they meant that by the right to social welfare of 1976 and the right to a basic minimum income of 1974 vagrants would have sufficient means. One of the constituting elements of the penal definition of vagrancy was exactly not to have sufficient means. When vagrancy was decriminalised in 1993, the Secretary of State for Social Integration emphasised that the 1976 right to social welfare was the gateway to provide help for vagrant persons (Onkelinx 1993). Adapted from the source document.

Social Integration and New Realities in the Swedish Welfare Society

Author: Montesino, Norma11 Department of Social Work, Linne University, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114093?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article argues that there is a discrepancy between the perception of social realities held by professionals of welfare (school teachers and social workers) in Sweden and the social realities of migrants, especially migrants depending on social assistance. The views held by professionals are rooted in an old model of social integration within the framework of the nation-state. This perception contrasts with the life conditions, expressed here in the consumption practices of migrant families who, in their daily life, are linked to both local and transnational places. Consumption is an "old question" that has been linked both to poverty and immigration. The article is focusing not on consumption as such; instead on consumption as an illustration of the mismatch existing between the professionals' view and the migrants' description of their own consumption. The analysis is based on a qualitative study including interviews with migrant families and welfare officers in a neighbourhood in Malmoe, a city in the South of Sweden with some 300,000 inhabitants, of which 29 % are born outside Sweden. Adapted from the source document.

Women's Empowerment and Microcredit: Emerging Spaces for Social Work Practice

Author: Meenai, Zubair11 Department of Social Work, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992489?accountid=14925

Abstract: Gender disparities among the poor contribute to significant risk and vulnerability in the face of personal or family crisis and during economic shocks. In addition, gender inequalities tend to be greater among the poor. The costs of gender inequality are particularly large in low-income countries, and within countries the costs are largest for the poor. If women are excluded from access to productive resources, public services or employment, it results in reduced output and productivity in farms and enterprises. To meet women's expressed need for improved access to credit - particularly to small loans, which allow them to engage in risk-averse, multi-production strategies and thereby improve the livelihoods of their families - thrift and credit or SHGs have been promoted. The SHG offers the canvas to conduct social intermediation, which would in turn provide women the opportunity to acquire the ability and entitlement to control their own lives, set their own agenda, gain skills, solve problems and develop autonomy. Empowerment sets the tone for converting the 'welfarist ability' to 'entitlement', where women do not take hand-me-downs, but demand and claim rights. The SHGs offer great potential for social work practice. Social intermediation implicitly acknowledges that many poor clients of microcredit are simply not in a position to use loans productively. Social workers have an important role to play in the social intermediation process. This article highlights the knowledge base of social work and the skills required at each stage of the development of an SHG to prepare social workers to take up their rightful role effectively. Adapted from the source document.

Revisiting the Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana

Author: Purushotham, P11 Centre for Self Employment and Rural Enterprises, National Institute of Rural Development, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753991774?accountid=14925

Abstract: A review following the implementation of the national rural self-employment programme that is, the Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana suggests a strong need for re-designing the programme features to improve the abysmally low levels of performance. The requisite changes are: (a) creating a professional and dedicated umbrella institutional structure at the state, district and block levels; (b) improving the quality of SHGs through capacity-building, training and hand-holding; (c) networking of SHGs in the form of federations to enable them acquire greater strength in market participation; and (d) most importantly, developing a highly proactive role of central and state governments in creating, experimenting and innovating a large number of livelihoods for self-employment seeking rural poor. Adapted from the source document.

Development of Mobbing Questionnaire for Educators in Turkey

Author: Gokce, Asiye Toker11 Faculty of Education, Kocaeli U, Izmit/Kocaeli, Turkey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611359?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable measurement tool for mobbing among educators. The sub-scales include aggressive acts that can trigger mobbing, causes of mobbing, and coping strategies against mobbing. The sample for the study were teachers (n=596) and school administrators (n=381) from public elementary schools, and teachers (n=593) and school administrators (n=272) from private elementary schools. Data was gathered using the 'mobbing questionnaire' that was specifically developed in order to determine factor structure of the scale by applying exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. For reliability of the scale, Cronbach Alfa coefficients of the sub-scales were calculated. Results reveal that the mobbing scale is valid and reliable. The analysis of its application provides empirical insights about how educators can be mobbed in the Turkish educational system. The results indicate that female educators were mobbed more than their male counterparts. Adapted from the source document.

Interface between State, Voluntary Organisations and Tribes: A Perspective towards Tribe-Centred Social Work Practice

Author: Akhup, Alex11 Centre Social Justice Governance, School Social Work, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612031?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article critically examines the role of the state in facilitating tribal development with a specific focus on the Grant-in-Aid scheme instituted for voluntary organisations (VOs) working for Scheduled Tribes (STs). Based on empirical data drawn from 146 VOs working for the welfare of the STs across 26 states, what is revealed is that there has been a high degree of 'fragmentation of the community' as an outcome of such a 'paradigm of intervention' and strategisation. The author argues that the premise of state-tribal community interface must be revisited and strategically reformulated within the avowed Constitutional vision and commitment to the protection and development of the STs 'along the lines of their own wisdom and genius'. Within these parameters of the debate and in keeping with the state's stated Xth Five Year Plan's three-pronged approach of social empowerment, economic empowerment and social justice, the author proposes a reformulation of the state's approach leading towards a perspective for tribe-centred social work practice in India. Adapted from the source document.

Comparative Study of Social Intelligence: Children from Planned Housing and Slums in Kolkata

Author: Sanwal, Tanushree11 Management Dept, Krishna Engineering Coll, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741609154?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study was designed to compare the social intelligence of two groups of children from Kolkata-those residing in planned housing and the others living in slums. Kolkata was specifically chosen as life is hard for those living in the slums of this city. The sample was selected using the purposive sampling method from different schools in Kolkata using criteria like age, sex, family pattern, family income and community. Questionnaire was the method chosen to collect data pertinent to the study. The tools used were Chadha and Ganesan's Social Intelligence Scale. The data was statistically analysed and results indicated significant differences in most measures of social intelligence between these two groups of children. The study indicates that children from planned housing have higher social intelligence than slum children due to better environment and child-rearing practices. Adapted from the source document.

Rural Development of West Bengal Districts: A Taxonomic Analysis

Author: Kumar Ghosh, Bidyut11 Dr. P.C. Mahalanabish School Management, Supreme Knowledge Foundation Group Institutions, Mankundu, Hooghly, West Bengal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613141?accountid=14925

Abstract: West Bengal is one of the more agriculturally progressive states in India, especially in foodgrain production. Introduction of some institutional and technological changes, mainly Operation Barga, and the introduction of high yielding varieties during the 1980s have turned the state into a progressive foodgrain producing state. However, this has not guaranteed that all districts of the state have achieved the desired level of rural development. The fact remains that rural development depends on several other socio-economic-infrastructural variables such as transport, education, rural marketing, rural electrification, and employment generation in rural areas. The question that needs to be answered in West Bengal rural economy is: Is there any tendency of regionalisation in the pattern of rural development in the state? If yes, then what factors contribute to the regionalisation trend in West Bengal? This article attempts at ranking the districts of West Bengal on the basis of some selected rural development indicators like yield of food grains, cropping intensity, rural transport, rural electrification, level of education, rural workforce participation, and so on. The study clearly establishes the fact that the development performance of the districts of the state varies widely. The study also reveals that there is an imbalanced regional development in West Bengal favouring the central and southern districts as compared to the northern districts of the state. The taxonomic analysis makes it clear that the state lags in the areas of stagnancy of foodgrain productivity, cropping intensity and rural road infrastructure. Adapted from the source document.

The SARS Crisis in Hong Kong: A Feminist Challenge to Social Policy

Author: Leung, Lai-Ching11 Dept Applied Social Studies, City U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61358458?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper concerns the risk that women faced during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003. The concept of a "risk society," which is developed by Ulrich Beck, has made a major contribution to our understanding of the SARS crisis. He points out that risk is not equally distributed among all people in society, but adheres to patterns that are based on class and gender. He also suggests that the increasing trend of individualization has created a set of obligations and responsibilities to people, any individuals who failed to avoid risk are seen as personal failure and to be blamed. During the SARS crisis, women were more likely to be infected by the virus, as the primary care takers of the family, in the community, and being health care workers in hospitals. However, women were at risk not only due to their role as carers, but the dominant and authoritative discourses that undermined their claims for protection. This paper attempts to deconstruct the discourses of the roles of women in health crises, and to discuss how the discourses interplay with other social structures to construct a "reality," to marginalise and silent women in a crisis situation. Adapted from the source document.

Socialism and Social Dimension of Work -- Employment Policies on Disabled Groups in China

Author: Chau, Ruby C M11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong rubychau@hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380409?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper is about employment policies on disabled people in China. It argues that the Chinese government has constantly emphasised the social dimension of work. Employment has therefore been regarded as an important means for disabled people to integrate into the society and to contribute to public interests. Various measures have been introduced in legislation and in policies on education and employment to enhance job opportunities for disabled people in the last two decades. However, the effectiveness of these measures is limited. In face of the keen competition in the expansion of the private market, many enterprises and welfare services do not have sufficient capacity or enthusiasm to promote employment for disabled groups. The paper argues it is important for the government to provide more support and incentives to enterprises, services, disabled people and their family in order to realise the social dimension of work among the disabled groups.

Abstract: This article begins with historical review on the roles of social exclusion and social inclusion in social welfare policy research in European area. And then critical reflect on the difficulties of social-exclusion-focused research model which domains the Chinese social welfare policy area. Basing on the literature review, through discussing on the current difficulties and insufficiencies of peasant workers' social welfare in China, the integrated model which should view social inclusion and social exclusion as one whole to be social welfare policy research model was proposed to meet the ultimate goal of social welfare policy. The importance of the integrated model was also discussed in the article as: First, integrating social inclusion perspective is consistent with the social harmony tenet which is highlighted by government; Second, integrating social inclusion perspective pays more attention on the functions of social capitals which may play an important role in facilitating peasant workers to adapt to urban cities, at the same time, social capitals may reduce the social welfare economic burden which can be easily accepted by government and facilitate the collaboration with government. Third, integrating social inclusion into social welfare policy research may facilitate the collaboration with government and reduce the tension between urban and rural. Forth, under the integrated model, social welfare policy researches may communicate with government flexibly and get more government support to make the policy realized; and finally, the agencies who can stand for the voices of peasant workers, such as social work team, NGO institutions can be developed rapidly.

Mental Distress and Internal Stigma in Seeking Professional Help among Women in Tin Shui Wai (TSW), Hong Kong

Author: Chiu, Marcus Y L1; Ho, Winnie W N; Sze, Fiona S F1 Dept Social Work, Hong Kong Baptist U, Kowloon Tong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61359505?accountid=14925

Abstract: Alarmed by a series of family crisis and suicidal incidents, both the government and non-government bodies have invested substantial amount of manpower and resources in TSW to promote professional services and prevent domestic violence. Yet, the effectiveness of such social investment was largely unclear. In response to this situation, a number of studies have emerged to reflect the community's needs. However, none of them have collected information specifically from female respondents, who are frequently the targets of domestic violence or psychiatric distress. In view of this, the authors purposed to investigate the psychiatric health and the help seeking pattern of female dwelled in the community. The present community study has three major objectives: 1. To estimate the proportion of female experiencing psychiatric distress in TSW district, 2. To explore the determinant of psychological distress among the subjects, 3. To explore the association between help seeking attitude and selected demographic variables. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding Social Theory for Social Work

Author: Pandya, Samta11 Centre for Equity for Women, Children and Families, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61379585?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article has attempted to deliberate on the various dimensions of social theory as a lens to social reality. Social theory provides 'sensitising conceptual schemes' to understand society, backed by epistemology. The sojourn displays paradigm shifts in comprehending the 'lifeworld', the antagonisms and contradictions inherent in society. The key to studied and reflexive practice in social work lies in building a base of ideologies and perspectives. These ideologies and perspectives draw their epistemic alignments from the array of discourses posited in social theory. The submission herein is that the internalising of social theory tenets thus becomes imperative to grasp ideologies and perspectives. In effect, there is a building onto positions in practice that then form a cogent whole. Some nuances of the connections with practice approaches have also been highlighted as a commencing point for further deliberations. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Abolfathi Momtaz, Yadollah1; Aizan Hamid, Tengku; Yahaya, Nurizan; Ibrahim, Rahimah1 U Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378294?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous studies in gerontology posit that widowhood significantly affects the psychological well-being of the elderly. This study examines the mediating effect of social network on the relationship between widowhood and psychological well-being. Data for this study consisted of 1,409 widowed and married older Malaysians. The results of a 3-step multiple regression analysis and Sobel-test (t=-2.22, p<.05) indicated that the negative effects of widowhood on psychological well-being is significantly mediated by social network. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Singh, Kuldeep11 Department of Political Science, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61358799?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article attempts to shed light on Dalit politics and leadership after Babasaheb Ambedkar by evaluating the role of Dalit-oriented parties and leaders in leading the Dalit Movement in the post-Ambedkar era. Attention has been more sharply focused upon the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), due to which considerable and significant political developments have taken place in Indian politics. The study of Dalit politics and leadership has been made in the context of both before and after the emergence of the BSP. Adapted from the source document.

Evolving Capacity-Building Strategies of NGOs for Financial Sustainability

Author: Siwach, Raj Kumar11 Public Administration, Choudhary Devi Lal University, Sirsa, Haryana

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61372710?accountid=14925

Abstract: The role of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the socioeconomic transformation of the powerless has been recognised at both national and international levels. But market-inspired and globalisation-induced funding priorities and conditionalities have compelled these NGOs to re-think and re-examine their resource mobilisation strategies. Having discussed the repercussions of these funding mechanisms prevalent in India, the author investigates some recent trends and changes in foreign funding and explores the possibilities of the applicability of new funding paradigms in India, which have already been tested in Latin America and elsewhere. The author opines that NGOs should reach out to local communities to establish their credibility and then, step-by-step, take up issues. They should also enhance their professional capacity in areas as mentioned in this article. Adapted from the source document.

Financial Tsunami, Economic Insecurity and Social Protection: The Case of Hong Kong

Author: Lee, Kim Ming1; Cheng, Ching Yin1 Division Social Studies, City U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992612?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rising economic inequality becomes an important concern for both advanced and developing countries. Nonetheless, political and business elites around the world never question the neoliberal agenda, despite economic crises happening every now and then. The year 2007 may mark the turning point of neoliberal globalisation. As the global financial tsunami kicked off from the burst of the subprime mortgage bubble in the United States in 2007, the global economy is facing an economic hardship never heard of since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Hong Kong as a highly open economy is also severely hurt by the financial tsunami. In every economic recession, all Hong Kong people suffer, but lower classes suffer most. This raises a serious question about whether the current social protection system adequately protects people against an increasingly risky global economic environment. By examining the social policy package adopted by the HK government in fighting against the financial tsunami, we show the lack of long-term strategies and commitments of the government in protecting HK people against globalisation risks and economic insecurity. By drawing experiences from other countries, we suggest that active labour market policies (ALMPs) may be the social policy tools the government can use to reform the social protection system. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Hong Kong Christian Service Jockey Club Lodge of Rising Sun (LRS) has commenced its operation in 2003. The centre aims at providing one-stop and humanistic drug treatment and rehabilitation service for opiate and poly-drug abusers aged under 30. The focus of the treatment method adopted by the center is not merely to solve the clients' addiction problem. Rather, it is to assist the clients in their growth process, so that they can cope with current problems as well as future problems better. All effort aims at building a loving environment and creating opportunity for clients' growth. An evaluative research, which was done from 2006 to 2008, aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the service provided by LRS through using a quantitative-qualitative mixed mode method. The result revealed that the service users have a significant improvement in their drug problems, and growth and development after receiving humanistic service provided by LRS.

Using Global and International Community Practice Case Studies to Enhance Critical Thinking about Domestic Community Participation, Social Power and Global Connections in United States Professional Social Work Education

Author: Gant, Lary; Paley, Julia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714209?accountid=14925

Abstract: In an effort to connect local domestic issues in a Midwest post-industrial city to global issues of economy and politics, the authors developed a variation of a "think globally, think locally, act locally" paradigm. This article discusses the infusion of global content into two professional social work education courses that comprised core content for an urban Community Based Initiative (CBI) in a large Midwestern public university located forty miles from the urban area. "Conceptual infusion" includes critical thinking about power relations, multiple meanings of participation, and the importance of global political and economic trends. "Structural infusion" includes application of theory to community practice. The impact of curriculum change was assessed by pre- and post-course questionnaires completed by course participants. The researchers used a grounded theory approach for qualitative data coding, analysis, and interpretation of 26 pre- and post-course questionnaires. Findings show improved understanding of global connections, power analysis, and participation in United States, Latin America, and Africa. The article concludes with implications for continuing social work education and macro community practice. Adapted from the source document.

Working in the Borderland: Implications for Social Work Education

Author: Peralta, Felipe; Anderson, Stephen C; Roditti, Martha

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714257?accountid=14925

Abstract: The U.S.-Mexico border area provides a rich learning environment for professional social workers, and at the same time poses challenges to social work practitioners as they graduate. This paper will explore some of the unique demographic and socio-cultural features that are barriers to the delivery of social services in the border area. These distinctive factors have implications both for the teaching of social work and the continuing education needs of social work graduates. Adapted from the source document.

Mexico: Past, Present and Future

Author: Lauderdale, Michael

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714240?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the beginning throes of vast economic decline and with a new presidency, the United States faces enormous decisions. None is greater than the response to events underway in Mexico, and yet the events do not have the deserved attention in either country. This is one article in a Special Edition of our journal examining aspects of issues between the United States and Mexico. The article covers well-known but often forgotten historical occurrences in Mexico, looks at Mexico's efforts to pattern itself as an economy like the United States, and concludes with an enumeration of some of the great challenges that loom for Mexico and the United States. Adapted from the source document.

Best Practices for Working with Pregnant Latina Adolescents along the Texas-Mexico Border

Author: Pittman, Sharon A; Feldman, Janis B; Ramirez, Noe; Arredondo, Sonja

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714261?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Latina/o population, the fastest growing minority group in the U.S. (Pew Hispanic Center, 2008), encounters problems similar to those of other ethnic groups in utilizing health care; however, they are largely misunderstood and underserved mostly because Anglo models that incorporate the importance of individuality and independence do not resonate with the Latina/o culture. This paper presents a best-practices framework for working with pregnant Latina adolescents that includes salient Latina/o cultural values of familismo, personalismo, simpatia, and respeto. While it is recognized that Latina/os are a diverse group, generalizations based on our target pregnant adolescent population of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Texas-Mexico border area are applicable to working with most Latina/os. Adapted from the source document.

Gender, race, job satisfaction and the social services

Author: Negi, Nalini

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714213?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social service work provides very low antecedents to job satisfaction mainly due to the high stress, relatively low financial reward, and often heavy work load. This study contributes to the sparse research on job satisfaction among social service employees. The study of job satisfaction is particularly relevant in these times due to rapid demographic shifts as well as often deep budget cuts in the social services. These dynamics have frequently led to social service employees shouldering the burden of higher demand with fewer resources. An understanding of job satisfaction is then essential to equip and to retain social service workers for these ongoing challenges. This study compares the satisfaction of women and men in social service employment. The understanding of gender relationship to job satisfaction is crucial as the majority of social service providers are female. Race is equally important in the study of job satisfaction due to the strong emphasis social service work places on multicultural understanding and inclusion. The results of this study reveal significant differences in the levels of job satisfaction for female and male employees, as well as those of different ethnic/racial minority backgrounds.

Evaluating Two Agency-Based Training Programs From The Perspective Of The Participants: What Worked For Whom?

Author: Crohn, Helen; Berger, Roni

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714217?accountid=14925

Abstract: A cross-sectional survey was used to evaluate two agency-based training programs. Program-specific questionnaires were administered to 85 clinical staff of diverse personal and professional backgrounds to study the degree to which these educational endeavors achieved their goals from the perspectives of the participants. These programs were offered by a large urban mental health and social service agency. Findings indicated a moderate to high perceived efficacy. Three unexpected findings are reported here: (1) participants valued collegial contact and the opportunity to discuss their work most highly; (2) participants valued gaining cutting edge knowledge less highly; and (3) participants of color perceived that the training programs helped them feel more valued by the agency, boosted their morale, and contributed to their retention at the agency significantly more so than the white study participants. Implications for social work professional development will be discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Moving Around to Get By and Try to Get Ahead: Immigration Experiences in New Settlement Communities of the Midwest

Author: Valdivia, Corinne; Dannerbeck, Anne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714264?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study is part of a three-year project to understand how Latino immigrants get by and get ahead in three new settlement communities in the Midwestern United States. In the last decade, immigrants have spread out from their traditional settlement areas along the southwestern region, as well as Florida, New York, California, and Chicago. While migrant labor has long been an element of the rural agricultural economy, the increasing number of meat and poultry processing plants has attracted newcomers to rural, new settlement communities, places which had not previously experienced an influx of foreign-born workers. Many of these newcomers are Latino, particularly of Mexican origin. Adapted from the source document.

Caring For The Genetics Services Needs Of Children And Families: Exploring Information Needs Of Health Care Providers

Author: Tijerina, Mary S; Selber, Katherine; Hernandez, Virginia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714220?accountid=14925

Abstract: A web-based survey explored perceptions of medical and allied health practitioners (n=86) about the statewide genetics services delivery system and types of knowledge needed to care for persons affected by suspected or diagnosed genetic conditions. Respondents viewed the system as fragmented, with service availability concentrated in urban areas. Cost of genetics services and practitioners' lack of knowledge about available services were identified as barriers to referral. Practitioners were perceived as knowledgeable about risk assessment, e.g., recognizing need for genetics services, but less knowledgeable about the clinical application of genetics information and identifying psychosocial problems requiring referral. Implications are discussed for strengthening the genetics system and for enhancing the genetics education of allied health professionals. Adapted from the source document.

Journey to the Drop House

Author: Westbrook, Max

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714268?accountid=14925

Abstract: While slowly it dawns on the public, law enforcement and human services professionals that Mexican immigration is exploding with serious and complex consequences, less is understood about the lives of those that risk crossing illegally. Drawn from a variety of case examples this article provides an all too typical illustration of that passage, and it details the reasons and some of the characteristics of the growing numbers of "drop houses" that appear in towns now miles beyond the immediate Mexican border. Adapted from the source document.

Mexico's Drug Wars: Implications and Perspectives from California and California's San Joaquin Valley

Author: Montana, Salvador; Cooper, Stephen

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714251?accountid=14925

Abstract: This essay discusses Mexico's drug war along the California-Mexico border occurring in the Tijuana, Mexico, border region. The authors also discuss Mexican drug trafficking into the United States from the San Diego-Tijuana border region and moving north to the San Joaquin Valley of California, one the most prosperous agricultural regions in the country. The authors examine the intersection of Mexican drug wars along the border, drug trafficking to the north, immigration from Mexico, and the San Joaquin Valley's agricultural economy and its relationship to socioeconomic conditions in the area. The human cost of the drug trade on residents of the San Joaquin Valley is also presented. The authors suggest that the San Joaquin Valley, one of the most economically depressed regions in the U.S. despite its successful agribusiness, may be more vulnerable to the influences of Mexican drug trade than other areas of the country, and also to current U.S. immigration policy meant to secure the U.S.-Mexico border.

Tuberculosis and Stigma: Two Case Studies in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico

Author: Moya, Eva; Lusk, Mark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714271?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two cases illustrate the social implications of tuberculosis in a low-income border region. Like many other people, the two women highlighted in this study have paid an enormous personal price for having encountered this infection. It has led to job loss, isolation, rejection, and the burning sting of stigma. The stories also illustrate the positive impacts that the TB Photovoice project had on them personally. However, most persons with TB are rejected by society, and unfortunately tuberculosis continues to be associated with lack of hygiene. Adapted from the source document.

Change in Frontline Family Workers' Burnout and Job Satisfaction: Evaluating The Missouri Family Development Credential Program

Author: Smith, Deborah B

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714227?accountid=14925

Abstract: Frontline family workers have stressful jobs. The Missouri Family Development Credential (MO FDC) program teaches frontline workers how to create partnerships with families they assist. This may relieve some of the burden of the job by assigning responsibilities to both worker and family members. To evaluate the program we use a quasi-experimental research design to gather data from program participants and from a comparison group of other social service workers for a total sample size of 229. Evaluation results indicate positive impacts for workers. At the bivariate level, we find significant differences in the amount and direction of change documented between pre- and post-training data collection with MO FDC participants' scores of global self-esteem, mastery, and professional self-esteem increasing and the comparison group's scores decreasing. The MO FDC participants also report a decrease in feelings of burnout while the comparison group feels more burnt out. At the multivariate level, after controlling for demographic and work environment characteristics, FDC participants are significantly more likely to report being less burnt out at Wave 2 than at Wave 1, and FDC participants are also significantly more likely to report bigger increases in their feelings of mastery than the comparison group. Adapted from the source document.

Globalizations: Unanticipated Consequences

Author: Lauderdale, Michael

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714276?accountid=14925

Abstract: Globalization in several forms has been a dominant theme at times in the world since Cyrus the Great of Persia, and later, the Romans, both empires which pushed far from home to distant lands. In more recent times -- since 1648-- globalization was driven by the colonial powers of Europe. Late in the 20th century globalization was generated by international capitalism as well as technological advances and the search for cheaper resources, including labor. This phase of globalization is likely ending as cheap oil and other resources critical for industrialized societies become dearer, and with the United States spread thin with foreign responsibilities and mounting debts. Yet the impact of globalization continues to play out with unforeseen events. Some of those that first affected the American Southwest and Mexican Border are examined. These events will force new directions upon the United States. The directions chosen are not clear but the direction that is chosen will have a substantial impact on the nation and its neighbors. We end with a consideration of strategic and tactical alternatives to deal with the Mexican collapse, and the resulting high levels of refugees, and the growing violence in Mexico and on the border that are being projected into the United States. Adapted from the source document.

Veterans Return to Civilian Life: A Review of the Factors Associated with a Resilient Outcome and How Social Workers Can Prepare to Help

Author: Smith-Osborne, Alexa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714230?accountid=14925

Abstract: Public concern over the treatment of returning injured service members from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom has escalated as deployment periods have lengthened, recuperation periods have shortened, and reports of inadequate case management and services have proliferated. Even before military operations began in Iraq, the Veterans Administration had noted a surge in the number of disability claims for PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder). Significant delays in processing disability claims and accessing timely treatment for veterans have also been identified as problems. These trends suggest the need for rapid mobilization of updated social work staff development in all areas pertaining to services for veterans and their families. Adapted from the source document.

Orphan Care: An Introduction

Author: Bailey, Jo Daugherty11 Dept Social Sciences, U Houston-Downtown baileyj@uhd.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61341850?accountid=14925

Abstract: This collection aims to cast light on the social work profession and its care for orphans in middle and low income nations. Four countries are profiled in this work, and the focus in each portrayal is the work done by professionals as well as the socio-political context of this work in the area of care for orphaned children. As will be argued later, both our international perspective and our understanding of the needs and care of orphans around the world are limited in the English language social work literature. This work represents an attempt to address these limitations. I whole-heartedly embrace Watts' urgent call,. Adapted from the source document.

Leadership: A Crucial Ingredient in Unstable Times

Author: McDonald, Catherine1; Chenoweth, Lesley1 School Global Studies/Social Science/Planning, RMIT U, Melbourne, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382656?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work is experiencing an unprecedented degree of institutional instability, particularly in the advanced industrial nations which, to varying degrees and via differing paths, have abandoned the Keynesian Welfare State. It has been replaced with a fundamentally different workfare regime in which operates on quite different assumptions -- all of which pose fundamental challenges to social work. The degree of change is such that it can be understood as institutional change. The profession needs a number of strategies in response the contemporary de-stabilization. Drawing on theoretical and empirical literature about institutional change we show why it is that professional leadership is crucial in the current environment. The paper reviews what in currently know about leadership, both in general and in relation to social work. Referring to the notion of institutional entrepreneurs and on the role played by other non-social work professional associations in situations of change, we articulate what role leadership can play. We conclude with recommendations about how leadership could be promoted, particularly by the professional associations. Adapted from the source document.

Orphan Care in Russia

Author: Schmidt, Victoria11 Dept Social Policy & Social Work, Faculty Social Studies, Masaryk U, Brno, Czech Republic schmidtvica@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365740?accountid=14925

Abstract: Current public opinion about the residential care system in contemporary Russia is extremely negative. A majority of Russians, both citizens and professionals, consider that family placement is the best arrangement for orphaned children. The year 2007 was announced as the Year of the Child in Russia. The majority of officials interpreted it as the year of de-institutionalization of the residential care system for children in Russia. De-institutionalization is mostly identified as reform focused on family placement instead of placement in institutions. Vladimir Fridlyanov, the executive director of the Ministry of Science and Education, announced in May, 2007 that the government is going to transfer 120,000 children from institutions into families every year from 2007 until 2010 and reduce the number of residential care institutions by one-third (Nesterova 2007). But the likelihood of family placement is small, with the exception of the adoption of infants without serious pathologies, and the attempts of precipitant de-institutionalization (when children's homes are closed and children are distributed among families) have failed (children were returned into children homes). According to the opinion of the Ministry, the key obstacle to effective de-institutionalization is the lack of professionals in adoption and foster care (Vazhdaeva 2006). Adapted from the source document.

Care for Children in Botswana: The Social Work Role

Author: Maundeni, Tapologo11 Dept Social Work, U Botswana, Gaborone Maunde@mopipi.ub.bw

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382601?accountid=14925

Abstract: The world over is experiencing an increase in the numbers of children who need care. The existence of children in need of care is not peculiar to contemporary Botswana society, it also prevailed in traditional Tswana society. What has changed is the volume of children who need care, and the resources available for their care. Like other African countries, Botswana is going through a process of rapid social, economic and cultural change. One of the characteristics of this change is the disintegration of the extended family. Consequently, the extended family can no longer cope with both the quality and quantity of care that children in need of care require (Botswana Human Development Report/BHDR 2000). Adapted from the source document.

The Care and Shelter of Children and Adolescents in Brazil: Expressions of Social Issues

Author: Garcia, Maria Lucia T1; Fernandez, Cristiane Bonfim1 Dept Social Work, Espirito Santo Federal U, Bento Ferreira Vitoria, Brazil lucia-garcia@uol.com.br

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390302?accountid=14925

Abstract: The future of Brazilian children who have the protection offered by familial bonds is threatened by social inequities that force them to seek shelter and grow up in shelters. According to the Institute of Applied Economic Research, an estimated 20,000 children and adolescents are served by institutions. The majority of these children are afro-descendent males between the ages of seven and fifteen years old. Of those researched, 87.6% have families (58.2% receive visits from their families, 22.7% are rarely visited by their families and 5.8 are legally prohibited from contacting or being by their families). The percentage of children and adolescents "without families" or with "missing families" is 11.3%. There is no information available for 2% of the children and adolescents residing in shelters. The principle factors that necessitate the placement of Brazilian children in institutions that provide care and shelter include poverty (including children forced to work, sell drugs or beg, for example); domestic violence; chemical dependence of parents or guardians; homelessness; death or parents or guardian; imprisonment of their parents; and sexual abuse committed by their parents or guardians. The issue of abandoned children and adolescents and their care and shelter in the Brazilian context expresses a perverse violation of Child and Adolescent Rights. Adapted from the source document.

Orphan Care in China

Author: Liu, Meng1; Zhu, Kai1 Dept Social Work, China Women's U, Chaoyang, Beijing,

Abstract: Orphan care in China was once provided by the central government as a means of social control. The centralized welfare delivery guaranteed some of the poorest orphans to be protected by the government. Since the economic reform, the central government started to relinquish its control over social welfare delivery, new forms of orphan care were introduced into China, sharing the responsibilities and burdens for caring the orphans. Yet, many issues and problems exist in social delivery due to a lack of finances, professionals, and policy support. In this chapter, we will discuss the background of social welfare changes in China, as pertains to orphan care, focusing on the different types of orphans as a result of social issues, service delivery, barriers and solutions. It is claimed that during the reform, the burden of orphan care in China may not be reduced in the coming future, and we offer suggestions to cope with that. Adapted from the source document.

Edna Chamberlain (1921-2005): A Leader through Times of Transition and Change

Author: Cooper, Lesley11 Faculty Social Work, Wilfrid Laurier U, Waterloo, Ontario lesleycooper@wlu.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61359650?accountid=14925

Abstract: Professor Edna Chamberlain was an outstanding leader in Australian social work. She contributed extensively to social work education at the University of Queensland, the social work profession through her leadership of the Australian Association of Social Workers and to the community through advocacy for progressive social policies. Her life experiences were influential is shaping her career and her particular teaching and research interests. Early in her life, Chamberlain was exposed to individual deprivation as a result of the Great Depression. This provided the incentive for a career in social work. She worked as a social work practitioner for some years and entered the academic world until after the death of her husband. In the university and profession, she was confronted by conflict between traditionalists and those wanting immediate reform. In managing these tensions, she tried to find the common ground but these tensions also moderated and changed her views about the purpose and practice of social work. Her rich practice and later research and teaching background provided a strong basis for her professional leadership, research activities and curriculum initiatives. Whilst social casework methods were influential early in her career she sought in later years to integrate the private pain of individuals with social policy and community planning by focusing on the purpose of social work -- demonstrating her commitment to the disadvantaged in the context of social justice. Adapted from the source document.

Marked Silence, Neo-Feudalistic Reactions and the Stabilized Moral Regime -- The Current De- and Reformation of "the Social"

Author: Kessl, Fabian11 Faculty Educational Science, Duisburg-Essen U, Germany fabian.kessl@uni.due.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61359593?accountid=14925

Abstract: The German chancellor and leader of the German conservative party, Angela Merkel, said in an interview a few weeks ago: "Nobody could have imagined a few months ago to what extent we would be pushed into state intervention programs. Of course, Merkel spoke on, this intervention is not easy for anybody. Therefore, she recommended turning back to the former course as soon as possible" (tagesschau.de, 11. Marz 2008, zit. nach Bildzeitungsinterview mit Angela Merkel, own translation). The worldwide celebrated new president of the United States, Barack Obama, said in an interview on CBS-News a few weeks before Merkel: "(...) there's no doubt that we have not been able yet to reset the confidence in the financial markets and in the consumer markets and among businesses that allow the economy to move forward in a strong way. And my job as president is gonna be to make sure that we restore that confidence" (CBS News, 16. November 2008, Obama On Economic Crisis, Transition; http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/16/60minutes/main4607893.shtml; Stand: 16. April 2009). These are only two examples, but other statements are almost the same in the last months -- particularly from political leaders in the OECD governments: The current crisis is seen as a period of an economic destabilization, distrust and lost confidence. Therefore, all solutions aim at re-building trust, confidence and, thereby, at a re-stabilized financial and economic institution and program structure. Consequently, the current crisis is primarily discussed as a crisis of the financial and economical system, as a period of economical weakness. Only one other aspect is also publicly present: the dimension of climatological and ecological questions. But this dimension seems to be a fig leaf of almost all current changes in rhetoric and is tied back to economical calculations, too: "Large-scale investment to fix global finances is an opportunity to move quickly to a low-carbon economy", like the Guardian wrote in the mid of March (17th March 2009). Questions of welfare, social security or social support are almost completely faded out in the current debates. The so-called Group of Twenty passed a its "Global plan for recovery and reform: the Communique from the London Summit" in London on April the 2nd this year. Here, for instance, the term "welfare" or "welfare state" does not appear, and the same applies for "social security", "social services" or "social work". "Social support" and "social protection" are only used twice regarding to the amount of $50 billion which should be available for the "poorest countries" -- and even with regards to the term "public" the paper only uses it in connection with "finance" at one point: "public finance" and the promised "public report" at another one. The crisis seems to be discussed as a crisis of a (capitalist) economy and solutions should, therefore, be solutions by way of (capitalist) economical instruments and programs. Other political or even cultural and social aspects are not present in the current discussions -- or almost represented only in very marginal notes. This economical mould of the current crisis debate is not only a hegemonic pattern, but also backed by other political actors or better by their silence: the marked silence of social movements, but also of social support agencies, like social services or social work agencies. Adapted from the source document.

The Core Life Values as Viewed by Turkish Women

Author: Ozmete, Emine11 Department of Social Work, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ankara University, Turkey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388626?accountid=14925

Abstract: Values refer to one's ideals and ultimate standards that are considered important in life. These are the principles for action encompassing abstract goals. This article evaluates the core life values of Turkish women. The results show that women give more importance to life values such as health, happiness and love. On the other hand, the life values of wealth and richness and a comfortable house are not considered important by women. Adapted from the source document.

Teaching History and Ideologies of Social Work: Some Reflections

Author: Pandya, Samta P11 Centre for Equity for Women, Children and Families, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61361177?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper is an outcome of several reflections and key questions that have arisen in the course of teaching 'History and Ideologies of Social Work.' Positioned as a basic course, the main endeavour is to study the historical evolution and the multiple ideological stances that the profession aligns to and draws from. But the very fact that neither the historical nor the ideological journey is linear, poses several questions and debates in terms of range, depth, pedagogy and context. Further, whether there exists one single rejoinder to the apparent brouhaha is in itself under contestation. If selection of tenets of few key ideologues and deliberating in-depth is the answer, then finding an appropriate ideological basket to suit the rendition is in itself a challenge. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding Parenting Practices of Indian Parents Living in Hong Kong for Development of Culturally Sensitive Child Abuse Prevention Services

Author: Lam, Gladys L.T.1; Chan, Yuk-Chung1 Department of Applied Social Sciences, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61341041?accountid=14925

Abstract: Indian mothers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire in this pilot study. Findings show that Indian parents are moderately supported in carrying out their parental responsibilities and working on their household chores. A small number of parents use abusive child-disciplining methods, and a number of them have a rather greater acceptance of the practice of authoritarian parenting. Indian parents in Hong Kong should be helped to understand children and develop skills to use non-violent methods in discipline. Adapted from the source document.

Social Inclusion, Social Exclusion and social Cohesion: Tensions in a Post-Industrial World

Author: Phillips, David11 U Sheffield, UK d.phillips@shef.ac.uk

Abstract: This paper intends to discuss several major theses on social inclusion, social exclusion and social cohesion. The first thesis is that there is a strong but complex relationship between social inclusion (mostly as an outcome but also as a process), social exclusion (mostly as a process but also as an outcome) and the social cohesiveness of societies. This has direct parallels with citizenship theories which will be discussed in passing. The second is that migration has a major impact on inclusion, exclusion and cohesion both in the migrants' country of settlement and their country of origin. The third is that national and personal identity have become extremely complex because of the massive increase in migration at present times under the influence of factors associated with globalisation.

Author: Chui, Wing-Hong11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong ericchui@hkucc.hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388682?accountid=14925

Abstract: Fieldwork is valued as an essential element in social work education. A partnership between students, agencies and universities is essential to a practical learning experience. Although this article is primarily concerned with issues surrounding field education in just one Australian university, this paper also makes comparisons with cases in Hong Kong where appropriate. Several aspects of field education including the dynamics of power in the fieldwork relationship, roles and status of field educators, on-going training provided for field educators and ways to strengthen collaborations will be discussed. The purpose of this analysis is to look at the basic principles of good fieldwork practice. Adapted from the source document.

Coping with Multiple Family Transitions: Experiences of Stepchildren in Hong Kong

Author: Tai, Lianne Yau-Yee1; Wan, Christina Wai-Kuen; Yan, Phyllis Fung-Ling1 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61349593?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study explores the experiences of young adult stepchildren who have gone through multiple family transitions of parental divorce and remarriage in their childhood or adolescence. The findings reveal that the stepchildren experienced an unsettling life in multiple homes. Despite having no choice or control over the family events, they seemed to have accepted well their role as passive participants, and perceived having both gains and losses in the process. Having a stable significant figure as well as something to look forward to seem to have brought them a sense of stability that was so important in helping them survive the serial changes in their lives. Various types of coping strategies have been identified as having contributed to the amazing resilience shown by the stepchildren in this study. Adapted from the source document.

Chinese Marriage and Divorce in Transition -- Divorced Women Being Trapped

Author: Hung, Shirley Suet-Lin11 Dept Social Work, Hong Kong Baptist U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61356450?accountid=14925

Abstract: While marriage leading to reproduction thus extending the family line has been taken for granted in traditional Chinese culture, divorce has been regarded as its evil opposite which is to be condemned. All, particularly women, should preserve their marriage and prevent its dissolution at all cost. To what extent it have these values been changed in a modern Chinese society -- Hong Kong? Reviewing local studies related to marriage and divorce, including two studies conducted by the author on meanings of divorce, this paper attempts to examine how divorce has been constructed and experienced by women in the Chinese society of Hong Kong. The specificity of Chinese meanings of divorce with reference to the uniqueness of the Hong Kong cultural context can be identified which reveals that marriage and divorce have been changing in the past few decades from traditional to modern models. Yet, the extent of changes is different when comparing the dominant values of marriages and divorce. Implications on social work intervention with divorced women who are caught in this transition are then drawn. Adapted from the source document.

The Ideological Orientation of the New Dawn Project

Author: Yu, Sam Wai-Kam11 Dept Social Work, Hong Kong Baptist U samyu@hkbu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355287?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the ideological dimension of the New Dawn project. It focuses on two analytical tasks. The first is to show that this project is not an independent reform measure. Instead it is a part of a series of pro-market welfare-to-work programmes launched by the Government to tackle social exclusion. The second is concerned with the debate on the desirability of this project in reducing social exclusion. As the design of this project is heavily indebted to market values, it is highly supported by those analysts and policy-makers who stress the importance of the labour market in helping socially excluded groups achieve social inclusion but it receives criticisms from those analysts who question the ability of the private market in tackling social exclusion. By carrying out these two tasks, the paper raises our awareness of the fact that whether people support the New Dawn project or not reflects not only their judgment on the effectiveness of this project in meeting the needs of single parents and carers on the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance scheme but also their views on market ideologies. Adapted from the source document.

Who Decides? Who Implements? Political Structure, Governance and Rural Development in Meghalaya, India

Author: Nongkynrih, A K11 Department of Sociology, North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong, Meghalaya, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61455593?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rural Development is one of the major objectives of India's planning and development. Since 1950 the central government has formulated various rural development programmes or schemes and state governments implement them. The paper explores, whether or not the political structure and governance is serious or competent enough to promote rural development. The paper examines this question based on field-based interactions in the Khasi and Jaintia Hills Districts, and consulting secondary materials. The paper demonstrates that the political structure and governance for rural development is centralised, and controlled by elected representatives and the bureaucracy. The outcome shows that rural development is not taking off, as it should; instead, it is benefiting only a few people at the expense of the rural poor; and the causal factor is the existing political structure and governance. Adapted from the source document.

In their Own Words: Learning about Child Sexual Abuse by Listening to the Perpetrators

Author: Sharma, Alankaar1; Gilgun, Jane F1 School of Social Work, University of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421230?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this article is to contribute to knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual abuse in India. We do so by challenging certain myths and discuss what perpetrators themselves say about their sexually abusive behaviours towards children. In their own words, perpetrators show that how they think about child sexual abuse is very different from widespread assumptions and beliefs. Adapted from the source document.

Human Rights Perspective in Social Work: Illustrations from Health Social Work

Author: Nadkarni, Vimla V11 Dean of the School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (February 2006-July 2008)

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61350238?accountid=14925

Abstract: The approach to social work in the field of health has been changing with the emerging discourse on human rights. This article establishes the relationship between social work and human rights, traces the history of health as a human right, and uses case examples from the field to discuss health social work in the context of three major approaches to human rights practice: empowerment, strengths perspective and anti-oppressive practice. Adapted from the source document.

Dalit Women at the Intersections: Voices from the Margins

Author: Kumar, Shewli11 Centre for Social Justice and Governance in the School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366580?accountid=14925

Abstract: The situation of Dalit women is intimately related to their location within the Indian society facing 'intersectional discrimination' as Dalit, as women and most of all as poor women.

Working with Individuals in Urban Settings

Author: Das, Shankar11 School of Health Systems Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375776?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social workers are required to work in a variety of settings on account of the constantly changing global and local environment, which is adversely affecting individuals and their families. Keeping the individual as the focal point, this article discusses the need to use a multi-theoretical approach such as the task-centred, behaviour modification systems, and crisis intervention approaches at micro, mezzo and macro levels. The knowledge and skills of practitioners must evolve with time and context. Adapted from the source document.

Revisiting Community Organisation in a Rural Context

Author: Bhide, Amita11 Centre for Urban Planning, in the School for Habitat Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61376723?accountid=14925

Abstract: Concepts such as community and models of community organisation (CO) have been defined in static terms for a fairly long time. They need to be revisited and their complexity appreciated. The current article demonstrates the potential of dialectical engagement of CO faculty in the field with a view to opening up theory to critical questioning. The nature of knowledge so generated is uncertain, dilemmatic, but it is more in correspondence with the realities of the day. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Practice for Rural Development: Some Reflections

Author: Kulkarni, Anjali11 School of Rural Development, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Tuljapur, District Osmanabad, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61328996?accountid=14925

Abstract: The experience of practising social work in rural areas is different from that in urban areas. This has led to the development of a rural specialisation in the social work profession. In this article, the author draws upon her experience of many years as a social worker in a rural setting, to explore the relationship between rurality and professional social work practice and education. Adapted from the source document.

Ethics for Social Workers in the Era of Globalisation

Author: Joseph, Josantony1; Joseph, Helen1 College of Social Work, Nirmala Niketan, University of Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366634?accountid=14925

Abstract: In today's globalising world, two starkly opposing ethical approaches seem to be holding sway: the individual-based teleological approach, and the tradition-based deontological approach. The social work profession needs to struggle to find a middle path, by identifying the values it wants to foster, learning to use rational ethical principles, and finally having the courage to openly state its ideological or moral stance. Adapted from the source document.

Privatization of Child Welfare Services: Lessons Learned from Experienced States

Author: Flaherty, Chris; Collins-Camargo, Crystal; Lee, Elizabeth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322715536?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent emphasis on improving efficiency, service quality, and innovation in child welfare services has prompted some jurisdictions to explore privatization or expand it to a broader segment of the service array. This extension of public/private partnerships has created new challenges in establishing effective contractual arrangements and in developing optimal mechanisms for oversight and quality assurance. Lessons learned by public agency administrators, private providers, and community stakeholders are reported. Method: Seventy-nine participants from 12 states participated in multiple focus groups. Findings: Numerous shared themes emerged including the evolutionary nature of the public/private partnership, the necessity for high levels of open communication between partners to problem solve, the complexity of defining appropriate and measurable performance standards, and the complexity of establishing contract monitoring and quality assurance systems that strike the correct balance between government accountability and the opportunity within privatized systems to promote creativity and efficiency. Adapted from the source document.

Exploratory Factor Analysis of the Index for Training Need (ITN) Interest Scale with Practicing Rural Social Workers

Author: Conley, Timothy; Schantz, David; Aronson, Sarah; Shae, Sarah

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322715558?accountid=14925

Abstract: All licensed social workers in a geographically large rural state were surveyed by direct mail concerning their addiction-training needs. Of these 382 licensed social workers, 76.9 percent responded to the survey (n = 294). The 20-item Index of Training Need's interest scale was included in the survey and subject to exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Alpha reliability for the scale is .95. EFA of the scale provides initial evidence of a three-factor structure, but scree plot interpretation and subsequent analysis processes do not support this. The scale effectively quantifies a single general construct of addiction training need for this population, and its items provide valuable information for social work addictions educators. Adapted from the source document.

Building Social Capital and Creating Innovation in Organizations

Author: Kelly, Michael; Lauderdale, Michael; Landuyt, Noel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322719195?accountid=14925

Abstract: Building social capital and successful organizations begins with participation; specific steps that can be taken to establish organizations that have remarkable success in reaching goals, securing the dedication of members and being aware of environmental change and improving the quality and effectiveness of their efforts. The approach of the Organizational Excellence Group has always been one of developing partnerships with organizations that choose to use tools -- such as The Survey of Organizational Excellence -- and take the path toward developing organizations that have transformational properties, including openness, trust and transparency. Adapted from the source document.

A Professional Development Model for Increasing Substance Abuse and Mental Illness Knowledge of the Child Welfare Workforce

Author: Sar, Bibhuti; Wulff, Dan; Sullivan, Dana; Weeks, Pamela; Wadlington, Kim

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322715563?accountid=14925

Abstract: The field of public child welfare is continuously challenged to identify ways to professionalize its workforce to address the problem of the increased incidence and prevalence of substance abuse and mental health issues among the families it serves. Kentucky has addressed this challenge by partnering with its state universities to jointly develop a specific curriculum focused on increasing child welfare workers' substance abuse and mental health assessment and case management skills.

Social Capital: Implications for Human Service Organizations and Child Welfare

Author: Montana, Sal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322719201?accountid=14925

Abstract: This is an exploratory study of the concept of social capital using a public human-service organization providing child welfare services as the basis for the study. Americans' perceptions of public human service organizations remain largely negative. Public child welfare organizations epitomize these negative perceptions. Some have suggested that social learning theory and organizational learning perspectives can guide efforts aimed at improving the performance of public agencies. This study builds on these perspectives by examining organizational life through the conceptual lens of social capital. Findings from this study suggest an operationalization of social capital is possible using more definitive conceptualizations and definitions of the concept. Implications for social work/child welfare knowledge and practice, human service organizations, organizational leaders, and social work education are drawn. Adapted from the source document.

Organizational Culture in Social Work Professional Education: A Case Evaluation

Author: Mason, Susan; Heft-LaPorte, Heidi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322715540?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports on a two-year sequenced evaluation of social work field education for employees of a large, urban, child welfare agency. A third year had been planned but an unforeseen crisis in the city where the study took place caused the third year to be aborted. A child protection center attached to an urban teaching hospital was the field education site for child welfare workers on temporary leave from their full-time jobs at a public child welfare agency. In returning to school for their masters degree in social work the students were required to adapt to the host agency's organizational culture, which differed substantially from that of the child welfare agency where they were employed. The host-agency staff reported equally difficult tasks related to working with the employee/students. The theoretical perspective of organizational culture helps to explain the varying and often conflicting perspectives of the students and the agency staff. This analysis focuses on four groups directly involved in the education experience: the students, the host agency staff, the supervisors from the public child welfare agency assigned to monitor the students' progress, and the field education advisors from the schools. The two-year qualitative evaluation, illustrates how a project evaluation can help bring to light areas of conflict and of potential resolutions. Adapted from the source document.

Attachment: Indicators from Caregivers and Toddlers -- Implications for Adult Treatment

Author: Fitton, Victoria; Mooradian, John

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322719171?accountid=14925

Abstract: An ethnographic study was conducted to observe indicators of healthy and pleasurable attachment between women caregivers and toddlers in natural environments. Nineteen dyads were observed for an average of 20.3 minutes. Data were collected in three ways: field notes, sketches, and reflexive writing. Six indicators of healthy and pleasurable attachment evolved from the coding process. Another fundamental component emerged from the study. Caregivers contained the environmental space for toddler safety and exploration. This supports the secure base functions of the attachment relationship. The indicators, and use of environmental space, provide categories for consideration in adult treatment and clinical education. Adapted from the source document.

Organizational Excellence and Employee Retention in Social Work

Author: Yoon, Dong Pil; Kelly, Michael

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714168?accountid=14925

Abstract: Turnover is an important cost, performance, and morale challenge for any organization. Any turnover must be balanced against a number of factors. To understand and control the level of turnover it is important to have a working theory of variables that may account for turnover. One might suspect that pay, working conditions, education, gender, job satisfaction, and general organizational morale might all contribute. To see if these variables do account for turnover and to provide some insight into how organizational leadership is involved in understanding and controlling turnover, the authors turn to data from a standard organizational assessment and data recently gathered from a moderately sized human service organization in a Midwestern state. The tool used to assess organizational members' attitudes on these variables is the Survey of Organizational Excellence. Some conditions -- such as low wages, poor facilities, and skimpy benefits -- will make people dissatisfied and prone to leave. These are the hygiene conditions. Other conditions -- such as challenging work, recognition, ability to pursue quality -- are factors that speak to the quality of leadership and opportunity to participate in the organization. They motivate people to work and to stay at the organization. When both conditions are met people stay, work hard, and build strong organizations. Organizations can utilize survey methods to assess factors that lead to employee retention or, conversely, high turnover. Adapted from the source document.

The Path to Partnership: Revisiting the Five Key Elements of University-Community Partnership

Author: Gass, Eric

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322715545?accountid=14925

Abstract: A new theoretical model of university-community partnerships was unveiled supporting five key dimensions of partnership deemed necessary for a partnership to function. Surveys have been collected and analyzed, and interviews have been conducted, with the goal being a deeper understanding of the partnership process, identification of dimensions that can be incorporated into social work curricula, and creation of a process that can be replicated to benefit the people and communities in which we live and work. Specifically, this article validates the prediction of the five key dimensions of university-community partnership. The relevant literature and content of the previous article will be reviewed, prior to discussion of the method and results of the current study. The results will then be linked to relevant curricular issues, as they relate to the continuing education of social workers. Adapted from the source document.

Influence of Workplace Features on Child Welfare Service Quality

Author: Faulkner, Monica; Borah, Elisa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714171?accountid=14925

Abstract: An ethnographic study was conducted to observe indicators of healthy and pleasurable attachment A substantial body of research exists documenting the impact of workplace features on the retention of child welfare workers. However, little evidence exists examining how those same workplace features affect services provided to children and families within the child welfare system. In this study, we examine the effects of multiple workplace characteristics on service quality perceptions. We use data from the Survey of Organizational Excellence, a biennial survey of all state agencies in Texas. We examine data from Texas Child Protective Services employees. Multiple regression was used to examine the impact of workplace features on service quality perceptions based on employee rank. Results suggest negative workplace environments lead to lower service quality perceptions. Employees most likely to be working directly with clients report low job satisfaction. Overall, employee perception of service quality is influenced by positive work accommodations and a positive organizational climate. Implications for professional development and training that incorporate these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Evaluating the Mentoring Program within Children's Protective Services

Author: Brooks, Richard; Montero, Rigo; Netardus, Tanya

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322719179?accountid=14925

Abstract: Retention of child welfare workers is a problem nationwide. The problem has existed for decades as evidenced by the Children's Bureau 1960 report "In Search of Staff for Child Welfare," which reported "staffing shortages nationwide, and urged aggressive recruitment and retention strategies" (Bernotavicz, 1997). Although many retention programs have been developed over the years to address the problem in Children's Protective Service agencies, the problem persists. In order to determine if the mentoring program was effective, evaluation of the program was necessary. The purpose of evaluating the mentoring program is to assist in obtaining further information regarding retention of child protective workers. This information will be helpful in determining the need for continuation of a mentoring program within Bexar County and to find out if there is a need to implement the program in stages of service other than Investigations, or throughout the agency statewide. In evaluating the Retention Agent Program, follow-up surveys within the organization were conducted to gather feedback on program efficacy and data on possible barriers to the program. Adapted from the source document.

Promoting Competent Service Delivery through Multidisciplinary Training: New Roles for Undergraduate Social Work Education

Author: Thompson, Gloria; Richardson, Roslyn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322715550?accountid=14925

Abstract: In addition to preparing students for generalist social work practice, social work programs are also called upon to take a leadership role in the development of relationships with community organizations. This goal is often accomplished through grant activities that create collaborative efforts between social work programs and local and state social service agencies. This article describes a collaborative relationship between an undergraduate social work program and a state agency that focused on the coordination of mandatory training for early intervention providers throughout the state.

Teamwork as a Remedy to Prevent Turnover amongst U.S. Public Child Welfare Workers

Author: Kyonne, Jinman

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322714205?accountid=14925

Abstract: The high turnover rates among caseworkers have emerged in the past decade as one of the most serious issues within U.S. public child welfare agencies. Studies have found that high burnout rates, low job satisfaction, difficult organizational climates, and educational background are the major reasons for turnover. One area that has not been well explored is teamwork. This study develops a construct of "teamwork" to study its relationship to turnover. Logistical regression analysis was conducted on an anonymous random sample of the responses of 319 public child welfare caseworkers to an organization-wide survey conducted in one U.S. Midwestern state in 2005. Findings indicate that the workers' positive perception of teamwork decreases their stated intentions to leave, whereas the workers' burnout increases their stated intentions to leave. Based on the findings, implications for social work practice, social agency policy, and directions for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Voices from the Past -- Examining Some Unintended Consequences of Searching for Cultural Antecedents: The Mungiki Gang in Kenya

Author: Ndande, Mary

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322719190?accountid=14925

Abstract: African nations were preceded by cultures that were hundreds of years old that were absorbed by the nation states that emerged from the colonial period in the 1950's and 1960's. Much of Africa, to varying extents, has adopted the characteristics of nation states found in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Common institutions such as education and government, a national language and currency, social welfare support programs, and a national identity have developed. However, tensions often remain between the nation state and the pre-existing cultures, and those tensions may present considerable challenges for professionals such as social workers, teachers, and police that provide human services. Kenya's history is like that of much of Africa. It has an ancient past of thousands of years, and it is still largely agricultural but with rapid movements of rural populations to urban areas. The Mungiki, initially emerged as a cultural group whose ideals were supported by some members of the Kenyan parliament who complained about the adulteration of Kikuyu culture, and wanted Kikuyu youth to shun Western ways and instead learn the original Kikuyu values (Kikechi, 2007). Adapted from the source document.

Reflections on Global Experiential Learning: A Participant's Perspective

Author: Jarolmen, JoAnn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322715554?accountid=14925

Abstract: Having learned and taught global social work issues and examined the different social policies and institutions of various cultures and countries, I was very attracted by an opportunity that arose at NYU and Case Western University. These universities were sponsoring a continuing education trip to the Netherlands to explore firsthand some of the social institutions of that country. Palliative care, euthanasia, substance use, and prostitution were the emphasis of this investigation. The journey was to be one week and included not only classroom lectures but actually observing the institutions and how they functioned firsthand. The group itself was composed of faculty, students, and graduates of various schools of social work. The age range was also varied. Very few of the participants knew each other, and the 30+ sojourners were to meet at Newark airport and commence the adventure. Adapted from the source document.

Homelessness, Social Work, Social Policy and the Print Media in Australian Cities

Author: Zufferey, Carole11 U South Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61331480?accountid=14925

Abstract: Homelessness is a significant social problem worldwide. This paper describes an Australian study that examined print media representations of homelessness and social work, social policy and social work responses to homelessness in three Australian cities. The research included a content analysis of seven Australian newspapers and semi-structured interviews with 39 social workers employed in the field of homelessness in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. The detailed results of these studies have been published separately elsewhere. This paper reports on how discourses in the print media, social policy and social work practice co-exist in constructing homelessness as a particular social problem, influencing social work responses to homelessness. The research found that individualism is central to many dominant discourses evident in the print media, social policy and social work practice, and that social work is practiced within unequal power relations embedded in organizational contexts. Adapted from the source document.

Professionalism and Information Technology: Positioning and Mediation

Author: Ley, Thomas1; Seelmeyer, Udo1 U Bielefeld, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61353569?accountid=14925

Abstract: The starting point of this paper is the assumption that -- on the one hand -- information technology (IT) is increasingly shaping the professional knowledge base and on the other the relation between organization and profession. IT is changing the role, responsibilities and practices of social workers and therefore it is important to deal with the impact of IT on social work (representative for many: Harlow and Webb 2003; Burton and van den Broek 2008).Hence, the general aim of this paper is to stimulate a basic discussion on 'IT application in social work', or rather, in a more general way, on 'technology and professions'. Secondly, it is about an analytical differentiation of the process of informatization, respectively formalization. Thirdly we want to discuss the assumption and overall combination of efficiency, effectiveness and IT. Therefore this paper is arranged as follows: After some opening remarks (chapter 1) we outline case management systems as research object (2). Further on, we confront the approach of reflexive professionalism (3) with the process of formalization (4). Subsequently, we touch on the debate of 'technologies of care' (5) and conclude with some short remarks on a research program (6). Adapted from the source document.

Tackling Youth Exclusion in the UK: Challenges for Current Policy and Practice

Author: Fahmy, Eldin11 U Bristol, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61349312?accountid=14925

Abstract: Addressing the situation of marginalized youth has been central to policy initiatives directed at tackling poverty and social exclusion in the UK in recent years. The period since 1997 has therefore witnessed a renewed emphasis upon the development of a coherent framework for youth policy in the UK with the goal of promoting youth inclusion and participation. Nevertheless, understanding the nature and prospects for policies designed to tackle youth exclusion involves a deeper interrogation of the concept of 'social exclusion' and its applications within UK policy debates. Here, it is argued that whilst considerable progress has been made in the promotion of a coherent and integrated strategy for youth inclusion in the UK such policies are unlikely to be effective without a re-conceptualization of the nature of social exclusion, its causes and consequences. In particular, a more holistic understanding is called for which extends beyond an emphasis on labor market activation policies as a response to the circumstances facing marginalized youth in the UK and elsewhere, and one which interrogates exclusionary processes and institutional practices rather than addressing only the symptoms of disadvantage. Adapted from the source document.

Marginalized Youth, the 'Modern' Professional and the 'Modern' Workplace: A Note on the Need for a Critical Approach to 'Modernizing' Strategies

Author: Garrett, Paul Michael11 National U Ireland, Galway

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61362098?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper briefly examines plans to 'transform' social work services for socially marginalized children and young people in England. More specifically, it will focus on moves to privatize social work services for children and young people who are in public care, or 'looked after'. In what follows, the focus will be on how the promotion of 'social work practices' (SWPs) -- the name of these envisaged new structures -- is discursively embedded in the idea the idea that 'liberation' and worker fulfillment can only be delivered within a privatized sphere. In this context, it will be maintained, the work of Boltanski and Chiapello may help to illuminate how the government and other primary definers are seeking to 'win hearts and minds' for further neoliberal 'transformations' within Children's Services in England. Adapted from the source document.

Marginalization of the Youth -- A Current Societal Development?

Author: Jensen, Niels Rosendal11 Aarhus U, Denmark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61357424?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article are partly inspired by and partly referring to Katrin Hjort. As a parallel to what Katrin Hjort is telling in her article, the author introduce the discussion by referring to a similar 'invention': Nearly 8-9 years ago as the author was still employed at 'The University of Applied Pedagogical Sciences' in Copenhagen a handful of my students was as part of their diploma work doing developmental work in a municipality in the southern part of Zealand. During their research and ideas on how to develop kindergartens to become more inclusive they were asked to 'prove' that an early intervention towards small children stemming from ethnic minority families was worthwhile. In other words: they were asked to do a cost-benefit-analysis. They were not only astonished, but directly shocked. So do the author, as they asked the author to supervise their analysis. Until then the author had naively it showed up -believed that early interventions had to do with children at risk, and that such interventions were part of the Danish welfare state arrangement in order to avoid the children to become later on really exposed. At least 10 years ago one could still get shocked. To day nobody would get surprised. We have over the recent decade got used to the argumentation that welfare should pay off for us. We are not supposed to love our neighbor as we love us self, we love our neighbors because of our selves (Petersen, L.H. and Petersen, J.H. 2007). Looking a little more in depth we are experiencing a displacement or even a shift in our understanding of the reasons for having a welfare state and likewise a displacement of what a democratic society is understood as. In brief: we are confronted with more competing models of welfare and democracy. Adapted from the source document.

What's the Problem? Precarious Youth: Marginalisation, Criminalisation and Racialisation

Author: Clarke, John11 Open U, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61383585?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since the nineteenth century invention of adolescence, young people have been consistently identified as social problems in western societies. Their contemporary status as a focus of fear and anxiety is, in that sense, nothing new. In this paper, the author try to combine this sense of historical recurrence about the youth problem with some questions about what is different about the present asking what is distinctive about the shape of the youth problem now? This is a difficult balance to strike, and what the author have to say will probably lean more towards an emphasis on the historical conditions and routes of the youth problem. That balance reflects my own orientations and knowledge (the author is not expert on the contemporary conditions of being young). But it also arises from the author's belief that much contemporary social science is profoundly forgetful. An enthusiasm for stressing the newness, or novelty, of the present connects many varieties of contemporary scholarship. One result is the construction of what Janet Fink and the author have referred to as 'sociological time' in which 'distinctions between past and present persistently offer over-unified accounts of a stable and settled past against which can be set a view of the present as dynamic, mobile, and fluid. Instead, the author think there may be some merit in 'historicising the present'. Rather than stressing the difference of the present, we might look for continuities in the conditions, relations and processes that underlie the construction, destabilisation and reconstruction of [social political and cultural] formations' (Clarke and Fink 2008: 228). In that vein, this paper begins by recovering some aspects of the history of the youth problem as it has been defined in western industrial-urban capitalist settings since the middle of the nineteenth century. Adapted from the source document.

Disconnected Youth? Social Exclusion, the 'Underclass' & Economic Marginality

Author: MacDonald, Robert11 U Teeside, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61383708?accountid=14925

Abstract: Most young people in the UK make relatively 'successful', unproblematic transitions from school to work and adulthood. What do we call those that do not? Labels imply explanation, not just description. Terms with academic and policy currency tend to define such young people by something they are not or by their presumed social and economic distance and dislocation from 'the rest'. How we might best describe, explain and label the experience and problem of so-called 'socially excluded', 'disconnected youth' is the focus of the paper. It draws upon extensive qualitative research with young adults growing up in some of Britain's poorest neighborhoods, looking particularly at their labor market transitions. Some of the problems and inaccuracies of underclass theory and orthodox conceptualizations of social exclusion are discussed in the light of empirical findings. Following CW Mills, the youthful biographies described are set in a wider panorama of social structure and economic opportunity, particularly the rapid de-industrialization of the locality studied. Understanding these historical processes of socio-economic change leads to the conclusion that, in short hand, 'the economically marginal' is the best descriptive label of the research participants and 'economic marginalization' is the best explanation of their condition. Adapted from the source document.

Social Integration Policies for Young Marginalized: A Capability Approach

Author: Bonvin, Jean-Michel1; Moachon, Eric1 U Applied Sciences Western Switzerland, Lausanne

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355270?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this context, activation is frequently identified with compliance with the expectations defined by officers of the public administration. Thereby, it is claimed that activation can take place without, or even against, the beneficiaries' consent. In other words, the prevailing view of activation or empowerment is imposed in a top-down way, and this applies especially to the most disadvantaged beneficiaries, who are also those submitted to the harshest requirements or sanctions. By contrast, the capability approach (henceforward CA) insists that genuine empowerment cannot be achieved if the empowered, i.e. the activated, person is not willingly participating to the process. In this alternative framework, the enhancement of individual capabilities requires both empowerment and free participation: if the former is missing, the individual recipient's freedom remains formal (in the Marxian sense); if the latter is not guaranteed, then empowerment boils down to paternalism. Hence, the challenge that the CA poses to the activation strategy is to design programs able to both empower the beneficiaries and respect their freedom to lead the life of their choice. This task is particularly requiring for the most disadvantaged people, among whom marginalized youth. This paper aims at providing an analytical and normative framework for assessing social integration policies set up for marginalized youth. Section 1 presents in some detail this framework, i.e. it proposes a concrete way to implement the CA in this specific field. Section 2 applies it to a specific case, i.e. a program developed for marginalized youth in a Swiss canton. The concluding section summarizes the main teachings of the case study both in normative and methodological terms. Adapted from the source document.

Women in Prostitution and Social Responsibility

Author: Bruckner, Margrit11 U Applied Sciences, Frankfurt/Main, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61361992?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to show how prostitution is embedded in historically changing gender relationships regulated by the state and part of each societies understanding of sexuality. An important role to improve the situation of women in prostitution is played by engaged social work, often linked to the women's movement on a local, national and an international level in spite of differing positions on the institution of prostitution. The authors argumentation is based on qualitative and quantitative empirical findings concerning shared experiences as well as differences between women in prostitution and findings on professional possibilities and limits of supporting the women. Important dimensions of heterogeneity amongst the women are legality versus illegality, decision making possibilities respectively dependencies und choice versus force, which also are the base of different political and professional positions taken by experts.

Citizenship Education -- Between Social Inequality and the Promises of Modernity

Author: Dorf, Hans11 Dept Educational Sociology, Danish U School Education, Aarhus U hado@dpu.dk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61443955?accountid=14925

Abstract: For several reasons citizenship & democracy has moved into political & research focus. Socio-cultural tensions & inequalities created by globalization processes boosted by neo-liberal modes of government seem to inspire a concern with "social cohesion," & the European Community assigns a key role to education in engendering European democratic citizenship. It can be questioned whether it is within the scope of educational programs to ensure social integration & democracy. However, to clarify the perspectives of the educational issue, the article discusses the conflicts & relationships between cultural identity & democracy within a framework of modernity before returning to the issue of education for democratic citizenship. It is shown on the basis of empirical studies that family background interacts with school factors in the reproduction of democratic inequalities. It is also indicated, however, that this must not be considered an unchangeable pedagogical fact, & the article briefly sketches a set of pedagogical & research challenges concerned with educating for democratic empowerment at different levels of school practice. Although this paper focuses on education & the educational system, the arguments & findings presented can also claim relevance for social pedagogy & social work, esp. in respect of recent developments that stress the educational dimensions of social work.

Governing the Local: Sovereignty, Social Governance and Community Safety

Author: Stenson, Kevin11 Crime & Conflict Research Centre, Middlesex U, Queensway, UK k.stenson@mdx.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61478576?accountid=14925

Abstract: There has been much commentary about the re-ordering of the relations between nation state government, geographical territory, and populations in the advanced liberal democracies. This is seen as a product of: increasing demographic and cultural diversity due to legal and illegal migration; economic, cultural, and political global interdependence; footloose mobility of capital and the outsourcing of jobs to poorer countries; the growing power of international corporations and financial markets; and the growth of supra-national bodies like the European Union and The North Atlantic Free Trade Association, the World Trade Organisation, and (debatably), the UN. These developments are held to be associated with the gradual demise of the model of the increasingly secular nation state first crystallised by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. This conception provided a mutual, guarantee of states' jurisdiction over territory and populations through their legitimated attempts to monopolise the use of force. Though, the relations between these states have always been asymmetrical and often challenged (Hunter 1998). This article explores the continuum of commentary about these issues, including tensions between a cosmopolitan universalistic ideology deployed by liberal professional elites and the more communitarian and nationalist ideologies deployed by politicians of the right. The latter emphasise the struggle for sovereign control of populations and neighbourhoods at local level. In exploring these themes this article develops a realist version of Governmentality theory, highlighting the interaction between governance from above and below. This is applied in a grounded way to the analysis of the local governance of community safety in the UK Thames Valley region. It identifies the political economic shifts in the region, then examines the local governmental responses to these changes, emphasising how, notwithstanding the hegemony of the political right in the region, well organised liberal networks of crime control professionals. They created a protective shield of cosmopolitan, universalistic values and policies against deeper communitarian and nationalistic sensibilities and strategies of governance. This facilitated the pioneering of a range of liberal, holistic, community safety initiatives that reconstruct 'social' governance at local levels. Finally, the wider implications of these governmental shifts are explored, and tensions in the struggles to maintain collective solidarity in the contested terrain of the nation state, represented at local level.

Jane Addams (1860-1935): Social Worker and Peace Builder

Author: Allen, James D11 St. Louis U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61381500?accountid=14925

Abstract: The name Jane Addams is typically associated with the Settlement House Movement. As a founder of Hull House, the first settlement house in the United States, Addams worked tirelessly on behalf of the poor and oppressed. Less widely known is the depth of her concern about peace and her efforts as a peace builder. A more careful review, however, of Addams' words and works reveals her passionate commitment to the abolition of war and the restoration of peace. This biographical sketch highlights the breadth and depth of Addams' work both as an advocate for the poor and as an advocate for peace. Adapted from the source document.

Evidence-based Social Work: The Actuarial Re-Casting of Social Work

Author: Webb, Stephen11 School of Social Work and Social Care, University of Sussex, United Kingdom

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378882?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article draws together some preliminary observations that suggest social work is being re-cast in the form of an actuarial programme of low-level functional tasks. The overall effect of this may turn out to be a de-skilling of the social work task. Actuarialism attempts to predict where and who in society poses the greatest risk, such that they are targeted in advance and acted against. A distinctive re-territorialisation of social work is at work involving professional claims and contests of jurisdiction over new tasks, problems, treatments, interventions and academic research. This entails strategies seeking to provide legitimation by formal knowledge and is rooted in particular values about what counts as relevant in social work. It is projected that new forms of technical expertise such as actuarial science come to play a dominant role in defining social work, especially within the neo-liberal political context. In establishing a foundation for this argument, various 'technologies of care' -- such as evidence-based practice -- are identified as emerging via the tutelary complex in social work. The fantasy of actuarialism is that experts -- in social work, mental health and criminal justice -- can be like weather forecasters, predicting the risk of anything from the next outbreak of child molestation to organised community drug dealing in advance. Adapted from the source document.

Accessibility and Affordability of Higher Education in the 21st Century in Lesotho: Role of Social Workers in the 21st Century

Author: Chitereka, Christopher11 The National University of Lesotho, Department of Anthropology, Sociology and Social Work, P.O. Roma, Lesotho

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61351342?accountid=14925

Abstract: Developing countries face new challenges in the 21st century, especially in the higher education sector. Both opportunities and threats are arising out of these new challenges. Higher education, therefore, seems central to the creation of intellectual capacity on which knowledge, production and a country's social and economic development depend. Chefa (2004) notes that higher education is a multi-purpose project that contributes to production and application of knowledge, training of a highly skilled labour force, social development, educational up-grading and generation and transmission of ideology. Utilising Lesotho as a case study, this paper will argue that because of its importance, the majority of Basotho are now seeking higher education. While higher education is growing in size and importance for Lesotho, it is also becoming more competitive, more global in nature and more influenced by the impact of technology. Most significantly, it is more and more functioning as a market rather than a regulated public sector. The article further argues that the majority of Basotho are no longer able to access and afford higher education because of a variety of reasons. The article begins by conceptualising education in general and higher education situation in Lesotho highlighting the challenges being faced by the nation in this sector. Finally, the role of social workers in this scenario will be examined. Adapted from the source document.

Teacher Motivation: Role of Values and Social Support

Author: Khora, Sthabir11 Centre for Studies in Sociology of Education, School of Social Sciences, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61376641?accountid=14925

Abstract: Teacher motivation is important for enrollment, retention and minimum levels of learning, which are the major problems of primary education in India today. The present study is an exploration into the relation between social support to the teachers at the local level and their motivation. Eighty-eight teachers from two blocks in Orissa were interviewed. Two factors were found to be important -- the values held by the teachers before they come to the teaching profession and the social support they got after they come to the teaching profession. Adapted from the source document.

Children in Conflict with the Law: Need and Scope for Social Work Interventions

Author: Dabir, Neela11 Centre for Equity for Women, Children and Families, School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378976?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children in conflict with the law belong to one of the most vulnerable categories of children in India. In India, most children in conflict with the law are caught for petty offences, and the incidence of recidivism is quite high. This paper highlights possible interventions by social workers/social work agencies in order to protect their rights, to prevent recidivism among the children in conflict with the law, and to work towards bringing them in mainstream. Adapted from the source document.

Reconceptualising 'Immigrants': The Idea of Transnational Citizens and its Implications for Social Work

Author: Sahoo, Ajaya Kumar1; Sangha, Dave1 Centre for Study of the Indian Diaspora, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388830?accountid=14925

Abstract: The social work profession has tended to conceptualise immigrants as 'citizens in development'; that is, individuals who are undergoing a process towards becoming citizens of the receiving country/society. By reviewing some of the literature on emigrants from India and from the literature on diasporic communities, we will consider the implications for social work. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Poor women lack the capital required for enterprise start-ups and although lending mechanisms exist in their economy, mainstream financial institutions are not oriented towards providing them with the funding they require. However, Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) in India have promoted microfinance through women's self-help groups. This paper takes a look at a non-governmental organization operating in six villages with six self-help groups formed by BPL women in Khed block in the district of Pune. The results showed that self-help groups have a positive impact on the socioeconomic development of beneficiaries, and helped to improving decision making, marketing and communication skills, building self-confidence among beneficiaries through schemes meant for them. Adapted from the source document.

Field Work Training in Social Work Curriculum: Reflections on Learning and Teaching

Author: Mallick, Anupriyo11 Eastern Institute for Integrated Learning in Management, Kolkata

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382225?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social Work is a profession that applies a working body of knowledge to the resolution of social problems and the enhancement of social functioning. Field education is an integral part of the social work curriculum. While classroom learning focuses on discrete knowledge and theoretical background, the field work curriculum exposes students to a wide range of problems and possibilities. It teaches students to assess situations and to develop, implement, and evaluate social interventions for actual persons, families, groups, organisations, and communities. In the field, students practice social work techniques in a variety of human service settings. There are opportunities for (1) building on and applying principles, concepts, and theories taught in classes and (2) developing discipline and insight into the use of self as a professional person.

Perspectives on Social Protection in Welfare Policy and Experience from Finland

Author: Backman, Guy11 Abo Akademi U, Finland gbackman@abo.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398344?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article aims to give some perspectives on social welfare in a globalizing world. The focus is on the West & East in a narrow sense; West from a European Nordic & East from an East Asian cultural perspective. Undoubtedly, modernization & globalization have brought about economic, technological & social progress & therefore, favorable effects on the development of postmodern society. However, progress is also followed by new risks & uncertainties which are not only found in the daily lives of individuals & families, but also the need to redesign social protection systems. Of course, risks always exist & are as old as industrial society, but in modern times, life is more complex than ever & the increase in complexity has probably been the most rapid in parts of the world where the economic, technological & social changes have escalated. In economically & technologically advanced societies, individuals & families are exposed to multiple risks & this can be disturbing to their social reality. In Finland, where the principles of the Nordic welfare model have been adopted, many people are still without work & financial resources of their own in maintaining an adequate standard of living. Young families with children have been affected the most. A welfare policy question is: "How can the social protection system succeed in handling all new & changing problems in modern living?"' In order to minimize risks in the future & provide a fair standard of living for individuals & families, social investment in children seems to be an important challenge for social policies & social work. Both in the West & in the East, there is a growing call for a joint responsibility that addresses an appropriate social protection against risks & uncertainties. People in modern times have more diverse & specific welfare needs than previously. The fulfillment of new & changed needs by welfare providers is becoming more difficult due to slowness in paradigm & policy renewals. It is a challenge for researchers to generate new knowledge from the study of different welfare systems. Scenario modeling & fuzzy logic may be good planning tools for future visions. While countries in the West are slow to adjust to new circumstances, their counterparts in the East have a new welfare climate for change, but there also exists unique resistance against policy changes.

Volunteerism and Self-Esteem of Young People

Author: Lee, Francis Wing-Lin1; Chim, Boby Moon-Cheung1 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong fwllee@hkucc.hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395035?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies on the relationship of volunteerism & self-esteem of young people have been scarcely conducted in Hong Kong. This paper reports such a study. Conceptually, Borba's five building blocks of self-esteem -- Security, Selfhood, Affiliation, Competence & Mission -- were employed in this study. Based on the concepts of the five building blocks, a measuring inventory was developed. Some 218 young respondents, who had more than a year of volunteer experience, were invited to complete a questionnaire. Their responses were compared to a control group of 129 young respondents who had no volunteer experience. The findings indicate that volunteer experience of young people can promote their self-esteem. Based on the findings, some recommendations on working with young people in order to promote their volunteerism & directions of further studies are suggested. Tables, Appendixes, References.

Power Games in the Pub: The Power Negotiations of Pub-Hostesses and Their Implications

Author: Leung, Catherine Lai-Yee1; Pang, Anthony Woon-Kei; Mak, Max Wai-Chee; Fung, Alex Lei-Kei1 Dept Social Work, Hong Kong Baptist U, Kowloon Tong clyleung@hkbu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61394838?accountid=14925

Abstract: Pub-hostesses are women who work in pubs whose job is to play drinking games such as "guessing the dice number" & "guessing the number of fingers" with customers to increase the amount of alcohol sold. Research was conducted by the Hong Kong Baptist University & the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals during summer 2005 to explore the power negotiations between pub-hostesses & society, their employers, & customers. Thirty pub-hostesses were interviewed & 25 pubs observed. Foucault's theory of power relations is used to explain the dynamics observed among the parties. The findings indicate that pub-hostess can only exercise weak resistance to the limitations imposed on them by the various parties, & that to improve their situation, changes at the structural, work, & individual levels are necessary.

Social Work Intervention in End of Life Care

Author: Stanley, Selwyn1; Selwyn, Sheeba1 University of Plymouth, Plymouth, United Kingdom

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61351296?accountid=14925

Abstract: Bereavement, death and dying are phenomena that social workers often deal with in various practice settings. Working with families of terminally ill patients and enabling them to cope better with their life situation is an important social work function. A wide array of professional skills, a mature and realistic attitude towards death and compassion and fortitude in intervention is hence required. This article examines several thanatological aspects, and discusses how social work intervention with end of life issues can be rendered with greater professional acumen. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: An attempt has been made in this article to briefly review the nature of practice and forms of manual scavenging in different areas in Andhra Pradesh, the castes which are engaged in this practice, their social profile, work conditions; and the impact of programmes taken-up to eliminate the practice and rehabilitate the scavengers. Efforts of NGOs involved with the upliftment of scavengers, and the movements led by them have been examined followed by a reflective review of future strategies to bring the scavengers into the mainstream of social life. The study is exploratory in nature and semi-structured interviews were used to collect information from the sample respondents comprising leaders who are involved with the issues of Safai Karmacharis, and other dalit NGO leaders. Respondents purposively selected from the scavenger communities were interviewed to obtain first-hand information about their work, living conditions and problems confronted by them. Checklists of questions were used to guide the interviews with the respondents. In addition, the official statistics drawn from different sources were used to supplement the information. Adapted from the source document.

Family Interaction Patterns and Dysfunction Analysis in Suicide Attempters

Author: Stanley, Selwyn1; Ramakrishnan, K1 Department of Social Work, Bishop Heber College, Tiruchirappalli

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388481?accountid=14925

Abstract: The literature on suicide reveals that this phenomenon has been frequently investigated in several specific groups such as the elderly, adolescents, substance abusers, the terminally ill, and other clinical populations. While literature on suicidology has been forthcoming in the international media, sufficient exploration has not occurred in the Indian context. The present study was conducted with a group of 50 suicide attempters admitted to a private psychiatric facility in India following a failed suicide attempt. Instruments to assess their family interaction pattern as well as the extent of dysfunction experienced in several domains were administered, besides studying their suicidal intent and the stressful life events faced. Poor family interaction pattern, particularly with regard to cohesion and leadership were observed. Dysfunction was high across all domains. The analysis was also based on gender and comparison of marital status. It was observed that while female respondents reported better family interaction, their dysfunction levels were higher than that for men. Unmarried respondents reported better family interaction, while the married respondents experienced greater dysfunction. The implications for therapeutic intervention have also been discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Growing Up in an Adverse Milieu: Education and Occupation of Sex Workers' Children

Author: Adhikari, Harasankar11 Department of Social Work, Visva Bharati, Sriniketan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61364117?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rehabilitation of sex workers, like their trade, is a perennial issue. To ameliorate the condition of the sex workers, attempts are being made to promote the development of children of sex workers through education, health care, skill training, and so on. The aim is to seek rehabilitation for the sex workers' children in jobs other than prostitution so that they can slowly integrate with the larger society. But the measures, both at the level of the female sex workers (FSWs) and their children, have not been successful. While the recruitment process of FSWs is a complex and multi-dimensional one preventing easy isolation of factors, its treatment is a challenging task. The measures aimed at taking out the FSWs' children out of the ambit of the FSWs' life are also equally important, but have not received the adequate attention that it deserves. Adapted from the source document.

Partnership to Improve the Lives of Children across the Spectrum of Child Welfare Services: A Land Grant University's Opportunity

Author: Collins-Camargo, Crystal; Flaherty, Chris; Weeks, Pamela

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61401957?accountid=14925

Abstract: The use of Title IV-E funding for child welfare has served to create new bonds between state child welfare agencies and schools of social work. Many current university-child welfare partnerships go well beyond early efforts to train new child welfare workers. Land grant universities are charged with improving the welfare of citizens within their respective states through a triadic mission of teaching, service, and research. The expansion of university-child welfare partnerships has created a unique opportunity for maximizing the impact of the land-grant university's mission in service of the state's most vulnerable citizens.

Achieving Desired Outcomes by Privatizing Child Welfare Service Delivery: Lessons Learned through the Kansas Experience

Author: Ensign, Karl; Metzenthin, Jaymee

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61369239?accountid=14925

Abstract: A decade ago, the State of Kansas privatized its child welfare services delivery system in an attempt to achieve desired outcomes. Within a couple of years, all family preservation, foster care, and adoption case management and service delivery was carried out by private agencies. Thus, the reform was comprehensive and implemented relatively quickly. This paper summarizes key reform elements and how these have evolved over the last decade. It also explains the many factors which complicated the reform's intended objectives -- politically, fiscally, and administratively. Along the way, many important lessons have been learned that can help inform other efforts to privatize child welfare services delivery and introduce performance measurement. Adapted from the source document.

The Privatization of Child Welfare Services: Issues and Efforts at the Federal Level

Author: Wright, Vicki; Radel, Laura

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61369957?accountid=14925

Abstract: There has been significant interest in privatization in child welfare, as in other sectors, from officials within the federal government and in some states. This article identifies several policy issues raised by privatized child welfare systems within federal child welfare programs, and describes two federal efforts to understand state and local child welfare privatization initiatives. These efforts are intended to provide information to those who may be considering privatization as a path to child welfare systems reform. Adapted from the source document.

Evaluating a Social Work Supervision Model in a Real-World Child Welfare Setting

Author: Smith, Carol H; Russell, Regina; Giddings, Martha M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365862?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Integrative Supervision Model (ISM) was implemented in a public child welfare organization to provide clinical supervision to MSW employees who desired clinical licensure, and to test the effectiveness of the ISM in a real-world practice situation. Data indicates that use of the ISM encouraged a more comprehensive review and clinical approach to child welfare cases on the part of participants, and resulted in a significant increase in their knowledge and skills as defined by the model. The findings were confirmed by LCSW Supervisors. The low response rate of child welfare supervisors will be discussed as well as other organizational and clinical implications. Adapted from the source document.

Knowledge Development and Transfer on Public/Private Partnerships in Child Welfare Service Provision: Using Multi-Site Research to Expand the Evidence Base

Author: Collins-Camargo, Crystal; Hall, Jennifer; Flaherty, Chris; Ensign, Karl; Garstka, Teri; Yoder, Brian

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61367541?accountid=14925

Abstract: Quality Improvement Centers (QIC) were established by the Children's Bureau of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to promote knowledge development and the effective transfer of that knowledge into practice in the child welfare field. An area identified as in need of research and resources is the privatization of services that have traditionally been provided by the public child welfare agency, as some states have begun to move in this direction. This was identified as a topic in critical need of research based on a knowledge-gaps analysis conducted by the QIC PCW. This article describes the purpose and preliminary data collected by the National Quality Improvement Center on the Privatization of Child Welfare Services (QIC PCW) regarding the nature of public/private partnership in this field. It also outlines a multi-site research initiative testing the impact of innovative performance-based contracting and quality assurance systems on organizational and client outcomes in three states. Adapted from the source document.

Is Social Work Education Relevant to Child Welfare Practice? A Qualitative Analysis from the Adult Learner Perspective

Author: McGuire, Lisa E; Lay, Kathy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365560?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work education has become increasing challenged to provide relevant curricula for child welfare practitioners. This study presents results of a qualitative evaluation of one Title IV-E-funded program for MSW student/workers of a public child welfare agency. Data analysis identified several themes that were used to develop a conceptual model of how social work education may impact worker retention in pubic child welfare with practice implications for the structure and process of IV-E-funded MSW programs. Adapted from the source document.

The Role of Self-Efficacy in Mediating Personal and Environmental Factors that Influence Practice with Crime Victims: Implications for Professional Development

Author: Davis, Fran S; Yoon, Dong Pil; Anderson, Kim M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391159?accountid=14925

Abstract: Assistance to crime victims has emerged as a practice issue that cuts across many social work fields of practice. Based on a mail survey conducted with 1,406 licensed social workers, a conceptual model is presented that explores the relationships among personal factors, environmental factors, professional self- efficacy, and knowledge and skills for working with crime victims. Using structural equation modeling, the following conceptual linkages were supported: those with more personal experiences and more support from their practice setting were more likely to have higher levels of professional self-efficacy, and, therefore, were more likely to have the knowledge and skills necessary to provide services to crime victims. Implications for professional development include roles and responsibilities of administrators and supervisors to provide access to continuing education, in-service training, consultation, and policies that provide both knowledge and skills for working with crime victims and a supportive environment that addresses the potential for compassion fatigue. Adapted from the source document.

Gender Inequality and Lack of Sexual and Reproductive Rights of Women in Ghana: Implications for Social Work Education

Author: Sossou, Marie-Antoinette

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61364051?accountid=14925

Abstract: Decades after the first international conference on women and the United Nations' conventions for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, inequalities between women and men still exist in Ghana. This phenomenological study made visible Ghanaian women's experiences of their lack of reproductive and sexual rights. A purposive sample of 68 female participants -- all with different educational, socio-economic, and occupational backgrounds, and from both rural and urban settings -- took part in six focus group discussions. The participants were asked only two questions, both related to their right to demand safe and protected sex and to practice family planning and birth control without permission from their spouses. Textual analysis, based on an adaptation of Smith, Jarman, & Osborn, (1999) interpretative phenomenological analysis, was used to develop two major themes, namely, "Reproductive Decision- making Is Not Easy for Us," and "Demanding Safe Sex Is a Thorny Issue." These themes are illustrated with commentary and direct quotations to depict a general sense of the experience of the phenomenon. Implications for social work education and policy advocacy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Striving for Excellence: Extending Child Welfare Performance-Based Contracting to Residential, Independent, and Transitional Living Programs in Illinois

Author: Kearney, Kathleen A; McEwen, Erwin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393703?accountid=14925

Abstract: Performance-based contracting for foster care case management services has been in effect in Illinois since 1997. It is credited with reducing the number of children and youth in out-of-home placement by over 65% in the last decade. Despite the success of this initiative in moving over 34,000 children into permanent homes, Illinois failed to achieve substantial conformity on any of the seven child welfare outcome measures in its 2003 Child and Family Services Review (CFSR). This article discusses the history of performance-based contracting in Illinois; lessons learned from foster-care case management contracting; the challenges in expanding this initiative to residential, independent living, and transitional living programs; the planning and implementation process used; and the proposed evaluation design. Adapted from the source document.

Compressed Social Work Education: An Innovative Approach to Continuing Education

Author: Zastrow, Charles; Weeden, Mary

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61370344?accountid=14925

Abstract: Compressed MSW education involves offering courses in a more intensive format, with the length of a course being substantially shorter than the traditional semester-long format. The compressed education format for an MSW program in the Midwest is described, and the results of an evaluative study of this format are summarized. The current students enrolled in this program overwhelmingly favor this format over the traditional semester-long format. The students also see a number of advantages in being a member of a cohort group. Adapted from the source document.

Court Training for Public Child-Welfare Social Workers: An Evaluation of a Training Program

Author: Bruce, Emily J; Lee, Stanley; Martinez, Cecilia; Lee, Peter Allen; Clark, L Michael

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398008?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of a forensic child-welfare social work training program. We sought to assess whether the professional ability of public child-welfare social workers was improved as a result of their participation in the training program. The program provides public child-welfare social workers with training in courtroom procedures and practices to improve workers' effectiveness in the juvenile court. The research team found that increased training was the most salient influence on the workers' perceptions of their improved professional ability. Adapted from the source document.

Maintaining Positive Public-Private Partnerships in Child Welfare: The Missouri Project on Performance-Based Contracting for Out-of-Home Care

Author: Watt, J Wilson; Porter, Rebecca; Renner, Lynette M; Parker, Laura M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368129?accountid=14925

Abstract: For many years, the State of Missouri Children's Division has worked in conjunction with private agency service providers and with the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Social Work to improve the quality of service delivery to children and families in the state. After an introductory, brief review of the recent movement for privatization and the use of performance-based contracting in child welfare service delivery, this article provides a conceptual overview of The Missouri Project on Privatization of Out-of-Home Care for Children, which builds on the past public-private collaborations in Missouri. The article discusses earlier research on the initiation of performance-based contracting and presents the rationale for the current project. This project examines both process needs of public-private partnerships for successful maintenance, including the renegotiation of performance-based contracts for out-of-home care, and the case-outcome results of the privatized service delivery. The Missouri project's relationship to the two other projects selected by the University of Kentucky Quality Improvement Center's project on Performance-Based Contracting and Quality Assurance in Public Child Welfare are delineated. Adapted from the source document.

Improving Practice and Outcomes through Collaboration and Performance-Based Contracting in Florida's Child Welfare System

Author: DeStefano, David; Elder, Jean K; Cooper, John; Schuler, Cynthia A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393452?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes the first six months of the Florida QIC-PCW demonstration project between the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) and Kids Central, Inc., a private agency contracting with DCF to provide child welfare services. The goal of this project was to demonstrate how to create a vision of service and performance expectations shared by DCF and the agencies that DCF contract with in a local child welfare network, utilizing performance-based contracting and financial incentives. This shared vision was developed by creating contractual performance-based measures through an inclusive planning and consensus-building process. We anticipate positive outcomes for children and families. Preliminary results indicate that case-management agencies are ready to incorporate performance-based outcomes and to establish front-line practice strategies. Adapted from the source document.

Everyday Sexuality and Social Work: Locating Sexuality in Professional Practice and Education

Author: Dunk, Priscilla

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496472?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work has seen increased intellectual interest in sexuality. However, little attention has been paid to the relevance of everyday sexuality for professional practice or how this might be integrated within existing social work curricula. This paper proposes that knowledge about everyday sexuality is vital to social workers as they deal with a variety of clients faced with the increasing complexities brought about by late-modernity. Additionally, it is argued that this knowledge base is congruent with the ethical and political dimensions of the profession. The PLISSIT model is presented as a possible pedagogical framework for social work education in this area. Adapted from the source document.

Enabling Access to Welfare Services -- The Place of Social Solidarity and Dialogue

Author: Patni, Rachana11 Brunel U, UK

Abstract: The welfare state in the UK presents immigrant communities with a set of institutions, which are potentially new and unknown. What is the best way to ensure that the questions of access to the welfare institutions are best managed? Trusting, understanding and feeling solidarity with the welfare state will obviously help with this problem. In order to shed light on this phenomenon, this paper presents a qualitative exploratory study dealing with elements of solidarity as perceived by members of the South Asian Community in the UK. Six in-depth interviews with South Asian first generation immigrants who had never experienced mental health problems were conducted. They were asked questions about who their support networks would be in the event of them experiencing mental health problems. The thematic analysis of the interviews suggests that the respondents believed that solidarity and support ties are found to be present in families, within the south Asian community and also with welfare institutions. It is concluded that there although things are far from perfect, assimilation and integration based on dialogue is an observable positive aspect of mental health service provision in the UK.

Social Service Territory and the University

Author: Bini, Laura11 U Florence, Italy

Abstract: Although - or because - social work education in Italy has for some 15 years now been exclusively in the domain of the university the relationship between the academic world and that of practice has been highly tenuous. Research is indeed being conducted by universities, but rarely on issues that are of immediate practice relevance. This means that forms of practice develop and become established habitually which are not checked against rigorous standards of research and that the creation of knowledge at academic level pays scant attention to the practice implications of social changes. This situation has been made even worse by the dwindling resources both in social services and at the level of the universities which means that bureaucratic procedures or imports of specialisations from other disciplines frequently dominate the development of practice instead of a theory-based approach to methodology. This development does not do justice to the actual requirements of Italian society faced with ever increasing post-modern complexity which is reflected also in the nature of social problems because it implies a continuation of a faith in modernity with its idea of technical, clear-cut solutions while social relations have decidedly moved beyond that belief. This discrepancy puts even greater strain on the personnel of welfare agencies and does ultimately not satisfy the ever increasing demands for quality and accountability of services on the part of users and the general public. Social workers badly lack fundamental theoretical reference points which could guide them in their difficult work to arrive at autonomous, situation-specific methodological answers not based on procedures but on analytical knowledge.

Neighbourhoods Mobilise the Troops -- Community Organising, Violence and Governmentality

Author: Stovesand, Sabine11 Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61419702?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article reflects on the difficult relation between community work against domestic violence and local crime prevention under the conditions of the neoliberal state that cuts down on social benefits and promotes self-help, active citizenship and self-responsibility instead while at the same time restoring the punishing state with its strict regime of law-and-order. The author describes a project Tarantula - she started herself while being a social worker in Hamburg, Germany. Tarantula was aimed at strengthening social networks and the neighbours' willingness to get involved in favour of affected women. Although conceptualized as an emancipatory approach referring to community organizing in the tradition of social movements it is questionable whether and how this can really work in the current situation. At present, the field of crime control is being reconfigured as a result of political and administrative decisions, which, for their part, are based on a new structure of social relations and cultural attitudes. The demolition of the 'welfare state' means the re-coding of the security policy that facilitates the development of interventionist techniques that govern and control individuals through their own ability to act.

Social Work Students' Use of Knowledge in Direct Practice -- Reasons, Strategies and Effects

Author: Blom, Bjorn1; Nygren, Lennart; Nyman, Cia; Scheid, Carina1 Umea U, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397519?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes a study of Swedish social work students' use of knowledge during their field practice. Data was collected by using short written narratives, where the students reflect on situations from practice, situations they experienced as critical or problematic. The narratives were analysed with a method inspired by the interpretation theory of Paul Ricoeur. The article starts with a discussion adhering to the present trend of evidence-based social work practice. This is followed by a study of 144 narratives from social work students containing critical or problematic events. A quantitative description of the material as well as qualitative model of two type-strategies, that social work students use, is presented. The results show, among other things, that students use several forms of knowledge, where facts/evidence is one of several. The study also shows that there is a strong adaptation to varying critical situations. A conclusion is that it is difficult to a priori define the types and proportions of knowledge to use in social work practice. Adapted from the source document.

Theory and Practice: A Matter of Words. Language, Knowledge and Professional Community in Social Work

Author: Fargion, Silvia11 U Trento, Italy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61423259?accountid=14925

Abstract: The relation between theory and practice in social work has always been controversial. Recently, many have underlined how language is crucial in order to capture how knowledge is used in practice. This article introduces a language perspective to the issue, rooted in the 'strong programme' in the sociology of knowledge and in Wittgenstein's late work. According to this perspective, the meaning of categories and concepts corresponds to the use that concrete actors make of them as a result of on-going negotiation processes in specific contexts. Meanings may vary dramatically across social groups moved by different interests and holding different cultures. Accordingly, we may reformulate the issue of theory and practice in terms of the connections between different language games and power relationship between segments of the professional community. In this view, the point is anyway to look at how theoretical language relates to practitioners' broader frames, and how it is transformed while providing words for making sense of experience.

Contingencies for Intercultural Dialogue in Virtual Space: An Empirical Research on the Role of Internet in Fostering Intercultural Competences from the Perspective of Migrant Youth

Author: Wang, Yafang

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61407000?accountid=14925

Abstract: Against the background of the emerging multicultural migration society, acquisition of intercultural competences is getting vitally important for youngsters to actively and effectively engage with intercultural dialogue in a co-existent life context. Contingencies for such intercultural dialogue and to foster intercultural competences of youngsters are opened in virtual space when youth with different ethnic, social and cultural background go online. However, differences in Internet use and competences acquisition as 'digital inequality' also exist among youth with different socio-cultural background. This article reports on a quantitative survey of 300 Turkish migrant youth in Germany as empirical sample about how Internet use generally fosters their intercultural competences, what differences exist among them and which indicators can explain the differences. Preliminary findings show that the contingencies of Internet in fostering intercultural competences are still not much employed and realised by Turkish migrant youth. Four online groups connected with bonding, bridging, both (bonding and bridging) and none socio-cultural networks are found out based on the cluster analysis with SPSS. These different networks, from the perspective of social cultural capital, can explain the differences concerning development of intercultural competences among them. It is indicated in this research that many Turkish migrant youth still lack recognition and capabilities to construct their intercultural social networks or relations through using Internet and further to employ the relations as intercultural social capital or social support in their life context. This therefore poses a critical implication for youth work to help migrant youth construct and reconstruct their socio-cultural networks through using Internet so as to extend social support for competences acquisition.

Quality Management and Formalization in Social Service Organizations -- A Survey on Home-Based Family Intervention Services

Author: Beckmann, Christof1; Otto, Hans-Uwe; Schaarschuch, Andreas; Schrodter, Mark1 U Wuppertal, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61410905?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the effects of quality management on social work are still widely unexplored, critics suspect that it will lead to a negative standardization of working conditions, whereas supporters of quality management hope for a greater transparency and effectiveness of service delivery. This article reports on a survey of 30 managers, 261 professionals, and 435 families in 30 family intervention service organizations. It uses cluster analysis to explore the relationship between quality management and different forms of work formalization. Results showed that working conditions generally are enabling for professional practice, but differences exist between what is called here a managerialist machine bureaucracy, an atomistic professional organization, and a collegiate professional organization. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article sets a stage for an interface between the process of political struggle vis-a-vis empowerment of Dalits and the deconstruction of development drive amongst the post-modernists in the development debate. It specifically aims at discussing the socioeconomic and political deprivation/development of Dalits historically. As a response to the post-development celebration of local culture, this article exposes the dominant local culture in India as a site of oppression leading to development exclusion of Dalits. It explores the specific political context of Dalit exclusion and locates modernity', both in the colonial and post-colonial period as a necessary socio-political condition facilitating change. Adapted from the source document.

India's New Caste War: The Archaeology of a Perpetual Conflict

Author: Mohan, Brij11 School of Social Work, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422583?accountid=14925

Abstract: Caste as a system of stratified inequality has globally survived in different forms since times immemorial. Its functionality on the subcontinent, however, is sustained by a mythologised social reality that runs contrary to the ideals of a secular democracy. This article seeks to theorise caste as a conceptual anomaly and a source of perennial strife-ascribed status, discontent and conflict-that pervade a civilisational crisis at the crossroads of progress. Adapted from the source document.

State, Market and Development of Dalits

Author: Teltumbde, Anand11 Petronet India Ltd., Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418970?accountid=14925

Abstract: Neo-liberal reforms have disoriented the developmental discourse around the State versus the market Dalits, as resource-poor people, have always relied on the resources of the State for their development. It was the State during colonial times that catalysed the emergence of the Dalit movement and associated development that created an impression among them about the neutrality of the State vis-a-vis their struggle for social justice. The neo-liberal paradigm tends to blame the persistent lack of development of Dalits to the State and promises to open up flood gates of opportunity for them. It was reinforced by the argument that globalisation, much like colonisation, would weaken the castes. Much of the resultant confusion, as the article argues, is due to the dichotomous conception of both the State as well as the market. While welfarism is not an essential feature of the State, as reflected by the statist position of Dalits, markets are incapable of channelling resources to them. Markets that necessitate the State in its primal coercive form can never benefit Dalits. Adapted from the source document.

Development of the Dalits: Some Observations

Author: Jogdand, P G11 Department of Sociology, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61407749?accountid=14925

Abstract: Development has acquired different meanings with the change in emphasis from economic growth to the development of the capacities of people. It is evident that socioeconomic development is explained in terms of an overall change, including social progress, economic growth, and change in perception and attitude of the people. In the case of Dalits, development is to be understood in terms of bringing them out of their degraded social status, acute poverty and exploitation. Undeniably, the reservation policy and other policies and programmes initiated by the Indian Government have helped the Dalits in getting access to different jobs in the public sector undertakings, educational institutions, and the political arena. However, much remains to be done. In a changing situation, emphasis should be given for entrepreneurship to take up self-employment in all sectors of the economy through training, education and provision of financial and other facilities. Adapted from the source document.

Global Standard of Social Work Education: An Asian Critique

Author: Yip, Kam-Shing11 Department of Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378782?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article intends to respond to the recent endorsement of the Global Standard of Social Work Education proposed by the international Federation of Social Workers and the International Association for Social Workers. A close look shows that the document is still unable to reflect the specific needs of social work education in Asian countries with the various dilemmas faced by the countries. In this article, the author discusses these dilemmas in detail and concrete suggestions are given to facilitate a meaningful discourse among various parties. Adapted from the source document.

Combating Alzheimer's Disease: Immediate Concerns and Implications for Social Workers

Author: Sinha, Debotosh1; Dey, Namita1 Department of Social Work, Viswa Bharati University, Sriniketan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378827?accountid=14925

Abstract: Dementia is a common pathology in late life and a term used to describe a number of physical disorders of the brain arising from different causes. Dementia is usually progressive, irreversible and ultimately fatal. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting for approximately 50 per cent of all cases. Of the 18 million people currently in the world with Alzheimer's, about 66 per cent live in developing countries. As the population grows and people live longer, these numbers will increase manifold by the year 2050. Lack of awareness about Alzheimer's disease and lack of knowledge on how to care for such patients leads to inappropriate care-giving. This article makes an attempt to see what exactly is Alzheimer's disease, its causes, the extent of the problem, diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment. The different stages of the disease, role of the care-givers, and the personal and emotional stress they face will also be dealt with. Discussions on the role of professional social workers are highlighted in the article. Adapted from the source document.

Poverty and Human Rights: The Role of Social Security and Especially Child Benefit

Author: Townsend, Peter11 Social Policy Dept, London School Economics & Political Science

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61406776?accountid=14925

Abstract: Poverty has been reduced by too little, or not at all, in recent years. A fifth, perhaps a quarter, of the world's population are living in extreme poverty. The measurement of the phenomenon, & especially of annual trends in the rates & severity of poverty, is not acceptably precise, consistent, & generally agreed. Nor is policy being analyzed & justified in precise correlation with such trend reports as have been published. The first Millenium Development Goal- to halve world poverty by 2015 -- has become an unlikely prospect. The reasons lie in the present form of the globalization of the market, together with continuing preference shown to neo-liberal economic & social policies. If poverty is to be systematically reduced, the orthodoxies of definition, measurement, explanation & resolution, which as key elements of the problem necessarily reinforce each other, have to be re-examined & re-formulated quickly. In re-examining approaches to measurement & policy the new human rights instruments, endorsed by a majority & in some cases by an overwhelming majority of governments, must playa vital role. Their potentialities are considerable for the measurement of poverty, deprivation, exclusion & development. But, crucially, they can help to engineer an international, as well as scientific, consensus in the war on poverty.

Abstract: This article is aimed to outline the features of Macao's social welfare system & identify its welfare model. The analysis shows that the welfare system is characterized by its low social welfare expenditure, mixed economy of welfare, underdevelopment of social rights, restricted impact on social stratification & the dominant role of the political-economic factors in social policy-making. It is argued that Macao's social welfare system has shared most of key features of other East Asian welfare regimes & therefore it can be regarded as a productivist welfare model.

Social Withdrawal of Young People in Hong Kong: A Social Exclusion Perspective

Author: Wong, Victor1; Ying, Winnie1 Dept Social Work, Hong Kong Baptist U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61402442?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the light of the social exclusion perspective, this paper discusses the indicators & different forms of social withdrawal experienced by young people in Hong Kong. The study examined the case records of 88 service users aged 13-24, & conducted 4 focus group interviews with a team of social workers involved in outreaching & reengaging the socially excluded users. Youth's personal agency exercised in their reaction to life events & crisis in the form of social withdrawal is arguably a complex social process, which is shaped, amongst other factors, by the hegemonic definition of youth trajectories & transitions to adulthood, & equally important by social exclusion at the institutional, cultural & relational levels. It is argued that both the structural & subjective dimensions of social withdrawal & reengagement work deserve critical examination in order not to further reproduce social inequalities & disadvantages. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

International Recruitment of Social Care Workers and Social Workers: Illustrations from the UK

Author: Evans, Sherrill1; Huxley, Peter; Munroe, Maria1 Social Carework Research Centre, Swansea U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395063?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper presents the results of a survey of international recruitment of social workers & social care workers into the United Kingdom. The literature on international recruitment, especially in relation to social care workers, is extremely sparse. Reviews conducted by the authors for the UK Department of Health did not find any definitive answer to the question of the numbers at present in the UK workforce, their movement between jobs, & their length of stay in the UK. The present study is based on qualitative interviews with three senior managers, four human resources managers, one employment agency manager, one senior social services inspector & three inspectors & three staff from the voluntary & private sectors. The interviews confirmed some of the major benefits associated with international recruitment: a reduction in vacancy rates; filling gaps in key shortage areas; improved sickness records; & once training has been provided the standards of care have improved. In addition, recruitment from overseas has the effect of creating a more diverse staff mix through the appointment of people with more varied experience & experiences. There may also be cost benefits associated with the reduction in costs of employing agency staff. The challenges involved are: having an ethical recruitment policy; the transferability of qualifications & skill sets, & cultural expectations & differences. Employers need to recognize that higher levels of induction are needed in order to meet the unique local knowledge requirements of an overseas candidate. Generally however, there are very few problems, & employers recruiting from overseas find that any problems that exist diminish with each round of recruitment, that is, as employers learn from their previous mistakes. Nevertheless, international recruitment is only a short term strategy, &, alone, does not solve the fundamental domestic problems that lead to the shortages in the first place. References.

Abstract: Domestic abuse is a major issue for a lot of major cities. Mandatory counseling and treatment programs provide external motivation, pressure, and encourage the participant to complete the program. Based on evidence, mandatory counseling and treatment play a major role in reducing and preventing family violence. If the counseling centre works in conjunction with the courts, this can force the offender to participate in the program. Court ordered treatment has a better success rate in comparison to voluntary programs. In such a program, the social worker can keep better track of the offender's progress, assess needs better, ensure that the victims are protected, and make appropriate referrals. Government support of the programs are necessary for the success of the program. References. Chean-Shin Ngo

Abstract: Social work mainly consists of helping people and improving society. Social work education is facing a lot of barriers. For example, lack of public recognition, lack of employment opportunities, and lack of quality professors. Often, the goal of social work education is unclear. To keep students motivated, and element of incorporating the 'social spirit' into the curriculum is needed. Other methods to increase the quality of instruction include; field method instruction, recognition of individual and group work, and a connection to the community. Society, schools, and the student need to work together to examine the barriers to a quality education. Tables, References. Chean-Shin Ngo

Record Keeping in Interdisciplinary Practices

Author: Kulbeth, Susan1; Cheung, Monit1 Graduate Coll Social Work, U Houston

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418066?accountid=14925

Abstract: Health care services today require an extensive amount of interdisciplinary effort & collaboration. Mutual knowledge among the variety of disciplines that interact within health care is essential in the process of promoting a teamwork concept. This study addresses issues that can arise when professionals from diverse disciplines work together in a health care setting. A systematic analysis of literature regarding documentation efforts necessary for client record management in the care team is focused upon, with special attention given to the role of social workers. Four major gaps in record keeping practices were found & highlight the need for an integrated approach to the design & maintenance of standardized & comprehensive patient records, but such incorporation has not yet been practically defined. The hindrances to record keeping practices define the need for establishing an evaluative component in record keeping. References. Adapted from the source document.

Factors Affecting Family Resiliency: Implications for Social Service Responses to Families in Hong Kong

Author: Y.C., Chan11 Department of Applied Social Sciences, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61419879?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study used the Family Hardiness Index to study the resiliency of families in Hong Kong. Results show that less resilient families are those in the low income group; those with family relationship problems; and those struck by a lot of family problems. Multivariate analysis found that only family income and family relationship problem are significant factors affecting family resiliency. Implications to social service responses are discussed in the light of these findings. Adapted from the source document.

Beyond Private and Public: New Perspectives on Personal and Personalist Social Work

Author: Chatterjee, Arnab11 Centre for Study in Social Sciences, Kolkata, West Bengal, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61408276?accountid=14925

Abstract: The slogan 'Personal is Political' has been deployed by feminist social work as an invitation for all of us to take oppressive private matters for public-political redressal. What is glossed over in this urgency is that the personal has been allowed to coincide with the private! This article argues that the personal is not private and urges us to go beyond private/public binaries. It concludes that the personalist social work reckons better with this corrective to aid feminist social work in the latter's emancipatory journey. Adapted from the source document.

Dimensions of Vulnerability, Agrarian Communities and Social Work Intervention

Author: Kumar, Ajit11 Matru Seva Sangh Institute of Social Work, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61370777?accountid=14925

Abstract: Land, an issue fraught with political implications, is central to the quest for removing rural poverty. This article traces two themes - the evolution of village politics in selected villages in Nagpur District; and charting out a conceptual framework of social work intervention for an agrarian community. This framework for intervention was based on both qualitative and quantitative data. The study reveals that, numerically, there are more poor among the land-owning Kunbi caste than the backward castes. The problems of castes other than the land owning ones and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is as yet unacknowledged. Adapted from the source document.

Social Services Workers' and Supervisors' Perceptions of Domestic Violence Training

Author: Payne, Brian K; Carmody, Diane Cyr; Respass, Gina; Hoofnagle, Kara

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716567?accountid=14925

Abstract: The lack of college coursework on family violence has resulted in a need for professional development focusing on the role of social services workers in domestic violence cases. Very little research, however, has considered how workers define their experiences with domestic violence cases as compared to their perceptions of training in this area. To fill this void, focus groups and in-depth telephone interviews were conducted to assess how social workers and supervisors described their experiences with domestic violence cases and their perceptions of the appropriate forms of training. Results show differences between the experiences and perceptions of workers and supervisors. Adapted from the source document.

The Children's Bureau Quality Improvement Centers: Knowledge Development Through Research Collaborations in Child Welfare

Author: Hafford, Carol; Brodowski, Melissa Lim; Nolan, Catherine; Denniston, Jack

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716164?accountid=14925

Abstract: With the renewed emphasis on evidence-based practice in child welfare the U.S. Children's Bureau has reinforced its commitment to empirically sound demonstration projects as a means of furthering best practices in this field. One critical thrust in this initiative has been the creation and funding of Quality Improvement Centers (QIC). Through involving intermediary organizations in grant making, managing the required research and disseminating findings, Children's Bureau sought to not only improve child protective practices but make demonstrations specific locality relevant and foster local and regional collaborations that would extend beyond the funding periods. This article summarizes finding from the interim national evaluation of the initial cluster of four QIC's focusing on some of the lessons already learned from this innovation and potentials for this model in future demonstrations. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Doctoral Students and Online Technology

Author: Swiefach, Jay S; Heft-LaPorte, Heidi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716570?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work practice today requires that practitioners be proficient in the use of online technologies. Although social workers can use information technology for such purposes as conduction research, sharing ideas, communicating with colleagues, and publishing work, very little is known about how social workers use these resources, and the extent to which online activities have supplemented and enhanced scholarly and professional capabilities. This article reports the findings of a study which examined the manner in which social work doctoral students use online technology, the patterns of its use, and perceptions regarding benefits and self efficacy. The implications and findings are discussed as well as some strategies to enhance the use of these resources among social work students, faculty and practitioners. Adapted from the source document.

University/Child Welfare Agency Partnerships: Building a Bridge Between the Ivory Tower and the State Office Building

Author: Collins-Camargo, Crystal; Hoffman, Kay

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716170?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the potential for true partnerships between university social work programs and public welfare agencies. This partnership has a deeply moral foundation related to the purpose of social work which is potential symbiotic and nature. Social work education and public child welfare both have a stake in the generation of evidence based practice through collaborative research. A rationale for the development of child welfare agencies as learning laboratories, in which the partnership with universities builds upon but extends beyond Title Iv-E training and education programs, is offered. Aspects of this potential collaboration include field education, professional education of practitioners, informing and conducting applied research, development and testing of theory-grounded practice techniques and practice protocols, maintaining the relevance of social work education, integration of field innovations into the curriculum, engagement in non-voluntary practice, understanding and interpreting public policy decisions, and the use of practitioners as social work educators. The comprehensive exploration of such a partnership offers much to both child welfare and academia. Adapted from the source document.

Meeting the Addiction Education and Training Needs of Rural Master's Level Social Workers

Author: Conley, Timothy B; Schantz, David L; Shea, Sarah; Vaillancourt, Mavis

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716572?accountid=14925

Abstract: A comprehensive statewide survey of Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSW's) concerning graduate level and continuing education training needs in addictions finds inadequate preparedness for work with addicted constituents, and high interest in and need for training. Respondents advise that addiction training be infused throughout the MSW curriculum or be separately required. Survey respondents numbered 294 which is 76.9 percent of the entire population of LCSWs serving a large rural state, all of whom were surveyed. Selected for survey because they are experienced providers, the group received education in social work schools across North America. Results from this sample confirm calls by others for increasing social worker's addiction related education. Implications for social work educational environments concerning addictions training and work force development missions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Secondary Traumatic Stress in Child Welfare Workers: Exploring the Role of Supervisory Culture

Author: Bride, Brian E; Jones, Jenny L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716172?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine relationships between symptoms of secondary traumatic stress and child welfare worker's perceptions of the culture of supervision in their organizations. A convenience sample of 307 child protection services workers responded to a web based survey that included measures secondary traumatic stress and supervisory culture and practice. Results suggest that action-oriented (active) rather than emotion-oriented (passive) support from supervisors is most helpful in preventing or reducing secondary traumatic stress among child welfare workers. Further, it is the qualitative aspects of supervision rather that the quantity of supervision that is most important in preventing STS. Adapted from the source document.

Personal and Organizational Correlates of Outcomes in Child Welfare: Implications for Supervision and Continuing Professional Development

Author: Ellett, Alberta; Collins-Camargo, Crystal; Ellett, Chad D

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716216?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes the finding from recent research focused on personal and organizations factors related to organizational outcomes in child welfare and discusses the implications of these findings for supervision and continuing professional development of child welfare staff. The results of several recent large-scale studies using quantitative and/or qualitative methods are reviewed as a continuing line of inquiry concerned with child welfare employee retention and organizational outcomes (including selected CFSR variables). The critical role that supervisors play in strengthening organizational culture and personal characteristics of staff (e. g. self-efficacy beliefs) as a means of enhancing organizational outcomes is emphasized and suggestions for future research are provided. Adapted from the source document.

Examining the Major Barriers to Employment Among TANF Recipients and the Role of Continuing Education in Preparing the Professional Workforce

Author: Thomas, Rebecca Leela; Fierro, Rita S; Novakowski, Scott

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716153?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper highlights the barriers to employment of TANF recipients. The dual goals of employment and family reunifications demanded clients to comply with the sometimes opposing demands of the service delivery systems. This paper underscores the importance of continuing social work education in informing workforce development efforts. These efforts include; 1) developing practice models of intervention; 2) creating a forum for service providers to network amongst themselves; 3) helping service providers understand and modify the demands placed on clients; and 4) developing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for social programs. Continuing education programs can provide important training in all these areas. Adapted from the source document.

Making a Mission Statement a Realty in Child Welfare: Resiliency and Solution-Focused Therapy as Core Strategy

Author: Anderson, Kim; Sundet, Paul

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716218?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child welfare agencies regularly espouse a philosophy of 'family-centered' and 'strengths-based' practice but factors including traditional practice, court auspices and deficient technology combine to impede attaining the worthwhile goals contained in the typical mission statement. In a three-year demonstration project designed to promote organizational culture change and increase clinical competencies of workers, this issue was added by adopting a human behavior base of resiliency and care intervention strategy of solution-focused therapy. This article details the implementation of that process and the empirical results on worker attitude and case performance. Adapted from the source document.

From Isolation to Teamwork: Mississippi's Story of Cultural Change in Child Welfare

Author: Shackelford, Kim; Sullivan, Kathleen; Harper, Maxine; Edwards, Tiffany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716220?accountid=14925

Abstract: Professional isolation is a major impediment to positive morale among public child welfare supervisors in rural settings. In this project in Mississippi supervisors in two regions were provided the opportunity for ongoing peer support by engaging in structured learning laboratories of their own design followed by regular mentoring sessions with university faculty. Using a quasi-experimental design an external evaluation team assessed the perceived changes in organizational culture, supervisee assessment of self-efficacy and worker turnover rates between the experimental and control areas and found significant positive impact from the model employed. The article offer practical suggestions on implementation of organizational change through supervisor development. Adapted from the source document.

Translating Group Learning into Individual Behavioral Change: The Role of Critical Analysis Tools in Professional Growth

Author: Sundet, Paul; Kelly, Michael

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716225?accountid=14925

Abstract: Improving supervisors' ability to teach, supervise and develop clinical skills in front line child welfare workers is critical to improving the quality of services and retention of skilled workers. However, Supervisory development presents a dilemma for the employing agency. Empowering supervisors to develop worker's critical analysis abilities, which are essential to effective case work, will likely involve questioning dearly held assumptions, values, and policies of the organization. This article explores the dilemma of training and development where such an approach is attempted. Should a staff development initiative for child welfare professionals be directed toward learning within agency defined boundaries, i.e. true learning? This article details a three year supervisory development programs designed to empower teaching and application of critical reflective skills in front line workers. Adapted from the source document.

Clinical Supervision in Public Child Welfare: Themes from Findings of a Multisite Study

Author: Collins-Camargo, Crystal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716234?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article summarizes the themes from findings of a multisite study conducted in four states' child welfare agencies to test the impact of the implementation of clinical casework supervision. The studies were conducted through the work of a ten state collaborative administrated by the Southern Regional Quality Improvement Center on Child Protection and funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Overall quantitative and qualitative findings of the intervention's impact on satisfaction with supervision, organizational culture, worker practice in assessment and treatment, and client outcomes are summarized. While the outcomes varied across sites, the overall findings support the potential for clinical supervision approaches to be used in this setting. The utilization of learning collaborations on the site and multisite level was successful in promoting positive findings as well as comprehensive dissemination activities targeted toward impacting practice. In addition, themes regarding the use of a university, public agency, community partnership, and factors impacting the implementation and evaluation of the projects are described. Adapted from the source document.

Toward the Development of a Research-Based Employee Selection Protocol: Implications for Child Welfare Supervision, Administration, and Professional Development

Author: Ellett, Alberta J; Ellett, Chad D; Westbrook, Tonya M; Lerner, Betsy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716230?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes components and procedures for the development of a new research-based child welfare Employee Selection Protocol (ESP). This protocol represents a model that child welfare agencies can use to better select employees with the requisite entry-level knowledge, skills, abilities, and values (KSAVs) that are considered minimally essential for effective job performance. The long-term goals of developing and implementing the new ESP are to: (a) improve the validity, reliability, and job-relatedness of current child welfare employee selection and hiring processes; (b) enhance the standardization of new employee selection who are suited for work in child welfare; (copyright) develop procedures to strengthen application screening of new employee who are suited for work in child welfare; (d) increase child welfare employee retention rates; and ultimately; (e) strengthen services provided to children and families. Implications for employee selection, supervision, and retention are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article introduces a complex partnership developed in a Northeastern state. Its aim is to optimize and stabilize public child welfare workforce and thereby improve outcomes for clients as well as results for county and borough agencies. To achieve this aim, this partnership has implemented a comprehensive, multi-faceted strategy. Intermediaries play pivotal roles in this partnership system. Originating with a focus on social work education, this partnership quickly focuses on research. Participatory workforce research aimed at understanding turnover led to hybrid, complex intervention involving team-driven participatory action research and learning in local agencies. These design teams, facilitated by social worker, connect professional development and organizational development to retention planning and ultimately, to workforce optimization initiatives.

Abstract: This article reports on the development and implementation of a 6-session child welfare and mental health training series developed in response to identified training needs by a local Department of Youth and Family Services and Department of Mental Health. A team of five facility members (four full-time and one part-time) delivered the training content to direct line workers and supervisors over a 2-month period. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation data are reported from the training sessions, followed by a discussion of the lessons learned from this training series. Suggestions regarding future trainings are offered. Adapted from the source document.

Capabilities and Education

Abstract: Argues that the "capability approach" that focuses on the individual's ability to exercise agency has the potential to offer a more comprehensive idea of a "pedagogy of inclusion" within education. The capability approach's capacity to deliver "just education" in light of increased social heterogeneity & inequality is assessed. Special attention is given to distinctions between "O-capabilities" & "S-capabilities" as complementary parts of a person's "capability set" & the tendency of the capability approach to blur this distinction in favor of a relationally combined perspective. It is maintained that the capability approach emphasizes personal, social, economic, cultural, & institutional factors that allow individuals to do & to be what is needed for their fulfillment. The definition of freedom that is at the heart of the capability approach is examined, along with what "just education" should encompass; & the provision of democratic "capability inputs" in the field of education. It is concluded that education not only incorporates basic capabilities but also promotes & expands higher, more complex capabilities. Figures, References. J. Lindroth

Czech Republic: Is Social Work a Science or Is It Just a Profession?

Author: Chytil, Oldrich11 Zdravotne sociallni fakulta, U Ostrava, Czech Republic oldrich.Chytil@osu.cz

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365671?accountid=14925

Abstract: A look at whether social work in the Czech Republic is a profession or a science focuses on the importance of education. The review of the history of social work education since the founding of the first school of social work in 1918 highlights post-1935 attempts to develop social work as both an independent profession & scientific discipline; recognition by physicians of the need for social workers in medicine; the 1945 establishment of university education in social work that included research clinics; the near liquidation of social work in the 1950s & early 1960s; political suppression of social workers by the Soviets; & social work research carried out by the Research Institute of Work & Social Affairs in the 1970s & 1980s. Since 1990, social work education has become one of the fastest growing fields in the Czech Republic. Newly created educational programs, including doctoral programs, are described, to conclude that social work in the Czech Republic is now both a profession & a theoretically grounded science.

What Price Social and Health Care? Commodities, Competition and Consumers

Author: Penna, Sue1; O'Brien, Martin1 Dept Applied Social Science, Lancaster U, UK s.penna@lancaster.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397119?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines changes, problems, & controversies that affect the organization & funding of health & social care services (HSCS) in member states of the European Union. It is noted that health & social services were excluded from a Framework Directive on Services of General Interest that was adopted by the European Commission in 2004. These services are now the subject of further initiatives. The increased interest in HSCS among member states is explored, along with difficulties stemming from both ambiguities in the economic/legal status of HSCS & the need to reconcile cohesiveness & competitiveness. It is suggested that many of these problems are the result of tensions arising from the contradictory characteristics of the complex networks of cultural, political, & economic spheres of action within which HSCS are situated. Special attention is given to conflicts that arise between the often conflicting goals of expanding markets & stimulating competitive economic development while simultaneously attempting to deliver social rights & secure social solidarity.

Dictionaries as Representations of the State of the Social Professions -- Some Preliminary Observations from an Italian Perspective

Author: Campanini, Annamaria11 Facoltadi Scienze Politiche, U Calabria, Italy annamaria.campanini@libero.it

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396281?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines the status of the social work profession in Italy where it has become a recognized profession but still lacks a clear disciplinary profile, is classified under Sociology, & offers limited opportunities for lecturers to undertake research or develop a theoretical foundation. However, numerous social work publications have appeared since the 1980s, including a "Dictionary of Social Work" that documents the profession's history, code of practice, theory, epistemology, & methodology in Italy. The Dictionary is used to consider the position of Italian social work in relation to the "European Platform for Worldwide Social Work" established in 2002 by the U of Parma in collaboration with 50 European partners, as well as other social work dictionaries published in France, Germany, Scandinavia, & Latin America. Cultural limitations involved in making valid comparisons are discussed, along with difficulties related to clearly defining the meaning of terms used in social work; efforts to develop a multilingual glossary; & the importance of identifying the point of view from which proposed definitions emerge.

Co-Operation between Social Service Providers -- A Comparison between Germany and Greece

Author: Claudius, Petra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61376905?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide an understanding of the co-operation between social service providers, delivering personal social services for the family as target group, in two municipalities in Germany and Greece. Based on a cross-national comparison between Germany and Greece, patterns of co-operation, and the influence of the socio-political context in terms of the respective legal framework, and the socio-cultural context in terms of the attitudes trust and solidarity will be explored. As methods, both analytical literature research and quantitative instruments, in particular a semi-structured self-completion mail questionnaire, were employed. As the German and Greek case shows, patterns of co-operation between social providers do not exclusively depend on the former stipulation by legal regulations. As in the Greek case, the existence of a wide range of forms and contents does not mean that there are a lot of linkages between the providers, and furthermore, that co-operation is frequent. As the Greek case shows, informal agreements as basis for co-operation implicate voluntary co-operation. Although the latter may be related to motivations of solidarity or contrary self-interest, they indicate stronger involvement in co-operation, and thus more action in terms of linkages and frequency.

To Work with Households That Are Facing Eviction -- An Advice Bureau of Housing Rent and Its Outcome

Author: Holmdahl, Johan11 Dept Social Work, Stockholm U, Sweden johan.holmdahl@socarb.su.se

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365625?accountid=14925

Abstract: A research note describes an evaluation of the effectiveness of a rental housing advice bureau in Solna, Sweden that is intended to help tenants in danger of eviction from losing their place of residence & becoming homeless. The evaluation was carried out within the frame of the Centre of Practical Knowledge established in 2002 through cooperation between the Department of Social Work at the U of Stockholm & eight municipalities in northwest Stockholm. A group of 76 clients who received help from the bureau was compared with a control group of 27 individuals that did not seek assistance. Data were gathered from both a quantitative analysis of information obtained from questionnaires & qualitative interviews with clients, landlords, & advice bureau staff members. The results showed no clear-cut difference in outcomes between those who received support from the advice bureau & those who didn't. However, it was indicated that households that contact the bureau have a good chance of avoiding the acute threat of eviction. The implications are discussed. References. J. Lindroth

Researching the Impact of Partial Labour Migration on a Child: Failure of Attachment Theory

Author: Malinauskas, Gedas11 Dept Social Work, School Social Work, Vytautas Magnus U Rovaniemi

Abstract: The aim of the article is to introduce a research report revealing the peculiarities of children experience when their parents are in the process of partial labour migration. Partial labour migration is a specific form of migration when one or both parents leave to work abroad (for more than 3 months) and the rest of the family stays in Lithuania. In case of departure of both parents, children are looked after by grandparents or other family members (for example, aunt). The article is based on the data of the quantitative survey Trends and Peculiarities of Labour Migration in Kaunas undertaken in all kindergartens of Kaunas city (N=88). Parents who had the experience of working abroad were surveyed using questionnaire. A special focus in the article is on the review of the attachment theory drawbacks. With reference to the attachment theory, a hypothesis was put forward that children under 6 should experience separation difficulties when parting with one of parents for a long time since they loose the object of attachment related to safety. According to the theory, this should especially be revealed in cases when children are fostered by grandparents. The research showed that a quarter of children experienced short-term difficulties, whereas 10% of children were negatively influenced by the departure. The hypothesis that children who stayed with their grandparents experienced more problems was rejected for there was no differences between parents' opinion and that of grandparents found. The question is posed in the article: what theories are needed to define in greater detail the experience of children "in the family brake process" when parents work abroad for a long time.

Welfare Reform, Accumulation and Social Exclusion in the United Kingdom

Author: Grover, Chris11 Dept Applied Social Science, County Coll, Lancaster U, UK c.grover@lancaster.ac.uk

Abstract: Jordan (2000) notes how while there is a possible confluence between social work practice and New Labour's social inclusion agenda, social work has been excluded from it. The explanation for this lays in the narrow definition, focusing almost entirely on exclusion from paid employment that frames political concerns with social exclusion in the UK. However, the policies designed to tackle social exclusion even in this rather narrow approach should be of concern to social work because it is possible that they will exacerbate rather than tackle the exclusion that many social work clients face. To explore these issues this paper draws upon Penna's (2001) argument that there is a tension between the desire to tackle social exclusion at a national level and global economic governance that constructs neo-liberalism as being the only way forward to economic prosperity and stability because the operation of neo-liberal political economy creates social exclusion. The paper examines these tensions by focusing upon what Adler (2004) identifies as a new model - the employment model - for the relief of poverty in the UK. The paper discusses the antecedents of the employment model in the shift from Keynesianism to neo-liberalism. The paper demonstrates that the employment model is concerned with regulating a number dilemmas related to labour power and the wage relation that have emerged from the acceptance of the global neo-liberal economy as being the only viable economic paradigm. It then goes on to discuss the contingent nature of this process, highlighting the contradictions raised by the employment models in terms of economic development and the tackling of social exclusion.

Migration, Urban Poverty and Underclass -- "Working in the Garbage"

Author: Acar, Hakan1; Akar, Seyhun; Akdemir, Gurhan; Aksakalli, Ulas; Alatas, Yilmaz; Engin, Mehmet1 School Social Work, Hacettepe U, Ankara, Turkey hacar@hacettepe.edu.tr

Abstract: With its socio-cultural and economic indicators and its location, Turkey has a contradictory social structure. At one hand, Turkey is one of the leading economies in the world. IMF (International Monetary Fund) informed that Turkey was the 21st biggest economy in 2004. It also indicated that Turkey would be the 17th biggest economy in 2006. It means Turkey will have a bigger economic power than Taiwan, Belgium or Switzerland. In contrast to its economic growth, governments of Turkey still fight for eliminating and reducing deep poverty rates. The State Statistic Institute (2004) stated that the number of poor people in Turkey has reached to 20 million in 2003. 23% of families and 37.8% of pre-school children live under poverty line. People need to find new strategies to cope and manage their lives. In this manner garbage collecting can be considered as a new employment field for the new urban poor in Turkey. Today, thousands of people and their families in Turkey have been involved in garbage collecting process as low-paid workers. This research aims to present one of the proofs of urban poverty and lack of social regulations towards the new urban poor. This study is a describing field research regarding the workers who work in city garbage in Ankara, Turkey. Research was conducted with 51 workers in 2003. Data were gathered by using a questionnaire prepared by the researchers. Researchers have used field observations and interviews as a secondary data gathering method in order to provide a rich presentation of results. At the end of the work, it is revealed that a majority of the workers in Mamak Garbage are adolescent and younger adults and have extremely low educational level. Significant numbers of the workers have immigrated to Ankara within the last 6 months from rural areas of the hinterland of Ankara. It is understood that these workers have been engaged in marginal jobs before. The garbage workers show typical characteristics that apply to members of the underclass. They have been living in poor conditions, generally employed in junk jobs for short-term periods and they continue to have little chance to develop their conditions. This can be characterized as typical poverty cycle. The workers have to work in difficult conditions such as long working hours and lower wages without social insurance. References.

Abstract: Robin Huws Jones, President of the International Association of Schools of Social Work from 1976 to 1980, lived a life of challenge and change. Born in Wales in 1909, he often remarked that learning to speak Welsh at age two was such a challenge that he didn't bother to learn English until he was six. The death of his mother when he was three led to the first of many changes in a life that was not easy in the formative years. Robin remained in the care of his father while his sister became the ward of two aunts. With his father, a draper's assistant, he left Wales to live in a crowded boarding house in Liverpool.

Three Decades of Social Work in France: From Security within the Welfare State to a State of "Disembedded Modernity"

Author: Ward, John11 IRTS, IDF Montrouge Neuilly sur Marne, France john.ward@gni.asso.fr

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387578?accountid=14925

Abstract: An overview of the changing status of social work in France over the last three decades contends that the move from security within the Welfare State to a "state of disembedded modernity" has created uncertainty & controversy over the place of social work in French society. Historical factors & key trends that have contributed to this state of self-doubt include the increasing complexity of the various social work professions; decentralization of the state; & a more politicized definition of social work tasks. The new social work role as an agent of insertion is examined, along with a shift in social work objectives that targets the growing population living in poverty; complications arising from urban development; the diversity of training programs; & the replacement of academic paradigms with action-based knowledge. Consideration is given to the viability of traditional social work in light of these changes & the absence of what Anthony Giddens (1991) referred to as embeddedness. The need for a redefinition of the fundamental aims of social work is emphasized. References. J. Lindroth

Domestic Violence: Local Activities -- International Issue

Author: Bruckner, Margrit11 Department 4: Health & Social Work, U Applied Sciences Frankfurt/Main brueckn@fb4.fh-frankfurt.de

Abstract: Since violence against women in the family has been made public by the international women's movement beginning in the 1970ies in Western States and after 1989 also in Eastern Europe a rapidly growing number of institutions and networks emerged. There exists a growing number of networks on the level of the European Union, which supports the anti violence work and research on this topic. About 30 years of research mainly in Western post-industrial societies show that in the analysis of violence towards women it is important to differentiate between culturally induced individual (or group) oppression by men and the way this is made possible by societal structures based on gender inequality. Therefore hierarchical family relations and personal behavior of men are one aspect to look at, the structural societal set-up the other. The extent of gender-specific violence can be interpreted as an extreme consequence of the hierarchical construction of gender relations, which seem to justify a personal and sexual subjugation of women and in the extreme even violence towards women. Without this structural component individual violence would not all together fade away, but would lose its societal and cultural back-up. Cross-cultural studies show the interconnection between a comparatively equal gender structure and little gender and generation violence and vice versa. The complexity of gender violence makes a theoretical position necessary which analyzes individual aggression (mostly male) and individual suffering from violence (mostly female) - often over many years - on the background of structural and cultural conditions including the multifaceted connections and breaks between these backgrounds and personal social practices.

Constellations of Disadvantage and Policy Dilemmas in Youth Transitions from School to Work in Bulgaria

Author: Kovacheva, Siyka11 Dept Social Science, Faculty Business & Social Science, U Plovdiv, Bulgaria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61408053?accountid=14925

Abstract: An exploration of problems in youth transition from education to employment & social participation in Bulgaria draws on the results of a 2004 Thematic Study that obtained information from the Bulgarian National Statistical Institute, Eurostat, government documents, research reports, & expert consultations. Economic, social, & cultural barriers facing Bulgarian youth seeking sustainable employment include deficiencies in vocational training; gender & ethnic inequalities; rural/urban differences, segmentation of the formal labor market; & a high unemployment rate for young people. Attention is called to the growing number of young people of "undefined status" who are not part of the regular education system, do not have job, & are not registered in labor offices as unemployed. The insecurity of temporary & part-time jobs is examined. Various policy approaches intended to support disadvantaged youth are reviewed & evaluated. Emphasis is placed on the need to both develop programs to prevent young people from dropping out of school & to establish an efficient training & counseling system. Tables, References. J. Lindroth

Evidence Focused Social Care: On Target or Off-Side?

Author: Dore, Ian J11 School Social Work & Social Care, U Sussex, Falmer, Brighton, UK ianjdore@yahoo.co.uk

Abstract: As contentions continue to engulf the evidence-based practice (EBP) debate within social care, consensus seems to be gravitating towards the softer term of 'evidence-aware' practice, although there is as yet no definitive concept on the horizon. Set against a back-drop of competing ideologies, heavily influenced by the natural sciences, what is at stake is the essence of social work: there is a real danger that social work practice be reduced to mere base elements, which seek to eliminate all notions of uncertainly, so essential and endemic to our social world; a characteristic of our very being. Underlying the surface arguments that an evidence-focused approach can realise better practice, are questions of power and control. In exploring the current position of EBP within UK social care, this paper argues that as an interpersonal profession, operating within the complexities of the social world, social work would be better suited to pursue an inclusive 'knowledge-aware' approach to practice, which may allow the profession to move beyond the restrictive and limiting polemics that surround it. Deliverance of a deserving future will require a brave and frank acceptance of our own fallibility, together with an openness which allows the profession to harness its key values. References.

Useful Knowledge for Social Work Practice

Abstract: Social workers have a long-standing interest in the relation of knowledge and practice. Both the tasks of practice and the knowledge used to accomplish these tasks are defining characteristics of any profession. They are the basis by which professions differentiate themselves from one another and the means by which they legitimate their activities to the larger society and culture. Theorists and researchers of knowledge utilization have identified it as having both conceptual and instrumental aspects. To better understand knowledge utilization in the field of social work, a group of social work practitioners were asked to reflect on the utility of various types of formal information and knowledge and sources of that knowledge. Practitioner respondents expressed appreciation for theoretical knowledge, but gave highest utility ratings to knowledge that helps them solve problems they confront every day in practice, i.e., information about a social problem or information about the effectiveness of a particular social work intervention. Younger practitioners were more enthusiastic than older practitioners about the utility of formal knowledge. Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Introduction: The Quest for Knowledge in Social Sciences

Author: Jayaram, N11 Centre Research Methodology, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61362905?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this introduction to the special issue on "Social Research Methods: Persistent Issues & Emergent Trends" the guest editor establishes the context theme of the journal as the quest for a knowledge about self & the circumstances in which one lives as the mother of all myths & doctrines, philosophies & sciences, including social sciences. The relatively recent emergence of humans quest for social science knowledge is contrasted with previous commonsensical knowledge handed down from generation to generation that, also taken for granted as knowledge, is frequently inconsistent & contradictory. The aspects of ontology, as the symbology, methodology, & methods are briefly define & related to subsequent articles that address issues about the debate on methodological perspectives, the distinction between quantitative & qualitative methodologies, & ethnography & fieldwork, & the relationship between research, social empowerment, & the ethical quandary. Although the 12 following essays cover a wide range of topics, know where the gaps remain and will hopefully be presented in subsequent issues. References. J. Harwell

Methodology of Social Sciences: Postivism, Anti-Postivism, and the Phenomenological Mediation

Author: Tharakan, Koshy11 Dept Philosophy, Goa U, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61400542?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses the two dominant modes of social scientific enquiry by bringing out the philosophical underpinnings of positivism & its antithesis as exemplified by the interpretative school. Traversing the philosophical trajectory, it provides an account of the methodological discourse encompassing (a) the 'unity of method' cast in the positivist mould, (b) the methodological dualism advocated by the verstehen school, & (c) the new thesis of unity of method, implied in the hermeneutic mode. It is claimed that phenomenology is capable of effecting mediation between the two rival modes of social scientific enquiry by integrating the different goals of social sciences, such as explanation & understanding, by synthesizing the empirical & the interpretative dimensions of the social world.

Constructivism in Social Science Methodology: A Reconsideration

Author: Hegde, Sasheej11 Dept Sociology, U Hyderabad, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61424943?accountid=14925

Abstract: Underlying the resurgence of theory & methods in social science research is the position that has been termed, broadly, 'constructivism.' This article is an attempt to critically engage with this position. Especially, it will be concerned to tackle the epistemological coordinates that attach to this position, while going on to reposition it in the context of debates in the history & philosophy of science & social science. The objective here is not to argue for one or other of the various sides to the methodological debate on constructivism, but to foreground how both critics & advocates can be addressing the question of scientific knowledge & truth in social science methodology.

Quantitative Data Analysis in Social Science Research: New Developments

Author: Singh, D P11 Centre Research Methodology, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61412960?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper discusses some new developments in quantitative data analysis in social sciences. Using the data from National Family Health Survey (1998-99), it illustrates the appropriate applications of data analysis, instead of the conventional way of dealing with such data for testing hypothesis. Particular attention is paid to the application of logistic regression & multilevel analysis. The paper discusses the application of these techniques & the resulting interpretations.

Space and Social Research: Some Methodological Issues

Author: Bhagat, R B11 International Instit Population Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421223?accountid=14925

Abstract: Of late, there has been a resurgence of space in critical social theory. The post-modernists have been in the forefront to show how the neglect of space in social sciences has paved the way for the precedence of time in social analysis historically. Furthermore, space is also being used to vindicate that theory building is virtually impossible due to variations in the contexts. However, this has not dampened the positivist spirit to seek generalizations; on the contrary, seeking generalizations incorporating space has been undertaken with much rigor. This has been due to the advancements in the statistical techniques in social research. The present paper illustrates this. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Qualitative Research Methodology: Epistemological Foundation and Research Procedures

Author: Nakkeeran, N11 Centre Research Methodology, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397414?accountid=14925

Abstract: As a method of social enquiry, qualitative research developed from the post-Cartesian intervention by Immanuel Kant. It is founded on the premises that the boundaries between the observed & the observer, & among reality, enquiry & representation are not unambiguous or unproblematic. It aims to discover new meanings & concepts rather than establishing causal relationships between narrowly defined variables. It proceeds with no a priori explicit conceptualization; its study design is flexible & open. Data for qualitative research is usually collected through in-depth methods, with long face-to-face interaction with subjects in the field. Data collection & analysis proceed concurrently with constant iteration between field, data & theory formation. References. Adapted from the source document.

Global-Local Interface in Ethnography

Author: Mathur, Nita11 School Social Sciences, Indira Gandhi National Open U, New Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421297?accountid=14925

Abstract: The presentation of cultures & lifestyles of people in ethnographic writing is greatly influenced by the major paradigms in the discipline of sociology & social anthropology. For long, ethnography remained confined to 'holistic descriptions' of cultures & ways of life of people representing 'little tradition' situated in territorially defined settings. Over time, there has been widespread acceptance of heuristic potential of post-modernism as a paradigm & the indelible impact that globalization as a force has on political, economic, & social relations of local cultures. Against this backdrop, sociologists & social anthropologists have had to shift focus from the elements specific to the culture being written about to juxtaposing local elements with global processes. The present essay seeks to trace the trajectory & explore the juxtapositions of the local elements with global processes in ethnographic writings. References. Adapted from the source document.

Continuing Engagement of Fieldwork and the Writing Machine

Author: Arora, Vibha11 Dept Humanities & Social Sciences, Indian Instit Technology, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397324?accountid=14925

Abstract: Fieldwork transforms our identities in the field, in our discipline (sociology/social anthropology), & the discipline itself. My fieldwork has not ceased with my physical exit from Sikkim, as by including archival data, worldwide web representations, audio-visual material, personal papers, & legal case files, my ethnographic engagement is a continuing one. Adopting the idea of 'writing machine' from George Marcus, I argue that ethnographic writing is a decision while fieldwork is not a trope of entry & exit but assumes an ever presence in us.

Vicissitudes and Visuals: A Methodological Discourse

Author: Chakrabarti, Dalia11 Jadavpur U, Kolkata, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61404000?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work, both as an academic discipline & as a practice, both in the form of civil society initiative & individual enterprise, can gain enormously by using the visual method. If social work implies efforts to extend benefits in response to the evidence of need, then visuals may provide such evidence, though without any modernist claim of truth. It may generate new knowledge, & even sharp critiques of establishment. The appropriateness of remedial measures to cope with the vicissitudes of various social categories can also be better determined on the basis of images of privation, than politically skewed official statistics. Both images & figures may supplement each other, yielding a set of different but inter-related representations of sufferance & its negotiations. This article makes out a case for the visual method under the broad rubric of qualitative research, reconstructs its life history, & brings out its potentiality. References. Adapted from the source document.

Research As a Process for Social Empowerment: An Anthropologist's Boundary-Transcending Reflections

Author: Menon, Vineetha11 Dept Anthropology, Kannur U, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61406808?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reflects on the process & product of anthropological research, focusing on issues of power & ethics. In this reflexivity, contextualizing the knowledge generated by a researcher in terms of her biography & her times is important. However, this gives rise to the 'subjectivity-objectivity dilemma.' To highlight how the multiple subjectivities of a researcher could interfere with the knowledge he/she generates & make that knowledge experientially more meaningful & richer, pertinent information from Verrier Elwin's biographical sketches are used. Considering how such knowledge could impact on policy, the article argues that the issue of subjectivity-objectivity resurfaces in action anthropology, a need of the changing times. Ignoring boundaries & paying attention to the processes that structure relations & reproduce structures, an enquiry into the transformative power of human agency could be brought center stage.

Ethical Issues in Social Research

Author: Thakur, Manish Kumar11 Dept Sociology, Goa U, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390386?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses some of the ethical issues in social research. It presents the key concerns of the ongoing debate on the complexity of interactions between the researcher & the researched. It also examines the relationship between the researcher & his/her peers, the sponsors & the public at large. While reiterating the need for a judicious balance between methodological rigour & ethical propriety, it questions the once-dominant belief that facts about social phenomena exist independently of our ethical subjectivity & that they can be discovered by using appropriate & objective techniques. References. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding and Promoting the Friendships of People with a Dual Diagnosis

Author: Dudley, James R11 Dept Social Work, U North Carolina, Charlotte jrdudley@uncc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365826?accountid=14925

Abstract: The friendships & other social supports of people who have a dual diagnosis of developmental disabilities & mental illness are very important to the quality of their lives. Yet, little is known about these friendships. The study reported in this article examined the best friend of 90 people with a dual diagnosis based on personal interviews with them. Questions explored the attributes that these people valued in their best friend, what they did together, & what they wanted to do. Questions also explored how staff members supported or discouraged these friendships. The study compared four general types of best friends. They were other consumers, staff members, relatives, & outsiders. The results suggest that each of these four types of best friends raise different issues & deserve different strategies for friendship-building. Overall, the results suggest that the friendships of people with disabilities deserve considerably more attention in continuing education & staff in-service training efforts. Several ideas are shared in the article for improving our understanding of their friendships. Recommendations are also offered for how continuing education efforts can help in enhancing their existing friendships & developing new ones. The results of the study can also be considered in furthering the friendships of other groups such as older adults, people with AIDS, & people with physical disabilities. 3 Tables, 34 References.

Toward Synthesis: Practical Techniques to Integrate Theory and Practice

Author: Murdock, Vicki1; Priddy, Wanda Wahnee; McChesney, Marja; Short, Glenda; Ward, Jim1 Division Social Work, U Wyoming

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61370839?accountid=14925

Abstract: A challenge faced by field instructors, as well as classroom faculty, is to provide opportunities for the social work student to make a workable "whole" out of a segmented curriculum & the distinct but interactive worlds of school & agency, a process that may take years. This article offers a practical module designed for field instructor & student learning about the process of integrating theory & practice (or classroom & field work) that has been evaluated positively by field faculty. The article offers a review of field education integration issues as well as detailed instructions & handouts for implementing the experiential activities. 4 Appendixes, 18 References.

Distance Education: The Use of Blackboard Software in Practice Methods Courses Taught Over ITV

Author: Kleinpeter, Christine B1; Glezakos, Agathi; Potts, Marilyn K1 Dept Social Work, California State U, Long Beach

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61361567?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this pilot study Blackboards software was introduced to supplement the traditional delivery of course content of a practice methods course taught over interactive television (ITV). Distance education (DE) students participated in a three-year, part-time MSW program taught utilizing 75 percent ITV & 25 percent face-to-face methods. This paper compares the utilization of case vignettes & discussion questions which were presented over the web to both DE & on-campus students. Case vignettes were employed to supplement course content in the areas of social work knowledge, values, & skills. Results indicated that a higher percentage of DE students utilized the web-based vignettes when compared to on-campus students. More research is needed to identify the most effective web-based teaching approaches in social work education, particularly, in practice methods courses. 1 Table, 40 References.

Attitudes of Members in One NASW Chapter about Social Action: A 1972 and 2003 Comparison Study

Author: Dickinson, Janet C11 Dept Social Work McKee, Western Carolina U Cullowhee, NC jdickinson@email.wcu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61371478?accountid=14925

Abstract: This survey of NASW members in one state of attitudes about social action replicates a 1972 survey. The 1972 & 2003 findings are compared. The 2003 response rate was 42 percent. Many agreed that social reform should be a high priority of the profession. Fewer agreed on tactics of social action. In 2003, respondents had greater agreement with many social action tactics, were more likely to voluntarily participate in social action before, during, & after graduate school, & felt greater obligation to clients & the profession than to their employer. Implications of these findings for continuing education are discussed. 7 Tables, 27 References. Adapted from the source document.

Child and Adolescent Sexual Abuse in Health Facilities

Author: Jaswal, Surinder11 Department of Medical and Psychiatric Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61409383?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports the findings of an exploratory study conducted in 2001 on the magnitude and patterns of child and adolescent sexual abuse (GSA) reported in a cross-section of public health facilities near Mumbai. It describes the process of identifying GSA in public health facilities, the health seeking behaviour of those reporting to health facilities and the handling and management of GSA by health care providers. The results suggest that reporting of GSA in health facilities is age and sex specific; and is reported only on appearance of severe symptoms related to the abuse due to lack of information as well as feelings of guilt, shame and fear. This is compounded by the attitude and lack of training of health providers on issues related to CSA. Adapted from the source document.

Female Sex Workers and Clients: Contexts, Sexual Behaviour and Implications

Author: Kumar, K Anil11 Unit for Child and Youth Research, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390066?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the linkages between contexts and sexual behaviour among two high-risk groups: female sex workers and their clients. Using data gathered from 501 female sex workers and 215 clients, the study reveals a high level of sexual demand from clients, and severe economic pressure on the female sex workers. Contrary to the general belief, clients are from both lower and better off socioeconomic categories; the proportion of married clients is considerable; and one-third of the clients are youth aged 15-24 years. About 50 per cent of clients and sex workers have ever experienced symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases. The article discusses the immediate and long-term implications of the observed contexts and sexual behaviour. Adapted from the source document.

Sexuality in Adolescents with Visual Disability

Author: Juvva, Srilatha1; Biswas, Bipasha; Rego, Anita1 Dept Family & Child Welfare, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390104?accountid=14925

Abstract: Groups such as the 'elderly', the 'widowed', and the 'differently-abled' are often considered to be 'asexual'. Therefore, inadequate attention is paid to understanding sexuality in these groups. This is reflected in limited research, training models and intervention available for such groups. With the guiding principle that 'no one is too disabled to be sexual', an exploratory research was undertaken to capture the understanding, experiences and construction of sexuality in adolescents with visual disability in the city of Mumbai. Using the life history technique and in-depth interviews to collect data, themes were generated to provide an understanding of sexuality. This article discusses the findings of the study in the light of the differing components of sexuality and other factors which influence the adolescent's sexuality as experienced by the researched. Adapted from the source document.

The Complexity of Indigenization of Clinical Social Work Knowledge and Practice

Author: Lee, Mo Yee11 Coll Social Work, Ohio State U, Columbus lee.35@osu.ed

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375826?accountid=14925

Abstract: Indigenization of clinical social work knowledge & practice is inherently a cultural encounter that entails a complex & evolving process. Neither a universalistic nor a culture-specific position can fully capture the complexity of such a process. The discussion examines clinical social work practice knowledge & its implicit values as originated based on Eurocentric experiences & values. Such knowledge is used to compare with cultural values & practices of viewing, expressing, & resolving problems of living among Chinese populations in Hong Kong in the context of continuity & change. Social workers & educators of the receiving culture would have to reflexively examine the attitude of cultural encapsulation, develop cultural self-knowledge, move beyond dualism, develop contextualized understanding, recognize the complexity of such a process, & develop research & practice models that gear toward these dimensions in their quest for developing culturally appropriate & viable modes of treatment for clients & families. References. Adapted from the source document.

Breaking through Barriers: The Political Actions of Hong Kong Outreach Youth Workers

Author: Ngai, Steven Sek Yum11 Dept Social Work, Chinese U, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391261?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on the narratives generated from in-depth interviews with 18 outreach youth workers in Hong Kong, this paper investigates the political actions of these youth workers & shows how they have invented strategies to construct their own style of emancipatory practice. Such strategies include (1) seeking new allies for development of community support networks; (2) establishing a research center for policy advocacy; & (3) organizing with youth for social change. The implications of the findings for realizing the liberating potential of youth work are discussed. References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391284?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objectives: To understand the social network characteristics & network satisfaction of people with psychiatric disabilities living in the community in Hong Kong. Method: A modified scale was administered to 251 service users attending 5 Community Mental Health Link (LINK) Services measuring the above variables. Findings: The study suggested that people with psychiatric disabilities living in the community have a small social network. Moreover, network satisfaction is related to network size & physical proximity. The results are discussed in terms of their consistency with overseas findings & the implications for social work practice in network building for people with psychiatric disabilities. Conclusion: The results provided an initial understanding of social network characteristics & network satisfaction of service users receiving LINK service, with particular reference to network size & physical proximity. Tables, Appendixes, References. Adapted from the source document.

Don't Jump, Mother Loves You: The Rescue of Social Work from the Suicide of Its Own Research

Author: Epstein, William M11 School Social Work, U Nevada, Las Vegas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377951?accountid=14925

Abstract: Instead of trying to improve its very inadequate research by yet another rededication to rationality, social work should take cognizance of its consistent failure across fifty years to produce any scientifically credible social service assessments. The pursuit of rationality in social work obscures its political acquiescence, a fable of the Arctic midgerby. The corrective myths of its research stunt the professional coming of age of social work & may well lead to its demise. Rather than social science, social criticism is more consistent with the field's traditions, inclinations, & capacities. References. Adapted from the source document.

Grazing Land to Dalits in Madhya Pradesh: Social Opportunity and Political Cost

Author: Choudhary, S N11 Dept Sociology & Social Work, Barkatullah U, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373388?accountid=14925

Abstract: Distribution of grazing land among the poor & dependent dalits, along with the right of ownership & one time material support, can lead to the empowerment of rural dalits in the country. At the same time, such an effort may contribute to social turmoil & displacement of the existing political system at the state level with the support of other forces. This article addresses some pertinent questions like the interface between land reform & dalits, the Bhopal Declaration, distribution of grazing land & social reaction, experience of dalit beneficiaries about the gains & pains of land distribution &, finally, displacement of the Congress-led provincial government. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374105?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article evaluates the quality of life, life satisfaction, & the relationship between the quality of life & life satisfaction of institutionalised elderly women & men. The study covered a total of 132 elderly, consisting of 64 women & 68 men between the ages of 60-98 years, with sound mental health staying at three care & rehabilitation centres affiliated to National Social Services & Child Protection Institution in Ankara. The quality of life & life satisfaction of the elderly were assessed with scales, including Likert type sentences. Life quality perception of men in terms of physical health is more positive compared to women. Life quality perception of women in terms of physical & social environment is more positive compared to men. In general, women have better life satisfaction than men. A meaningful relationship has been determined between the quality of life & life satisfaction of the elderly. Comprehension of life quality & life satisfaction in old age & determination of the relation between quality of life & life satisfaction will contribute to the development of applicable long-term service programmes required for the improvement of the life conditions of the elderly women & men.

Social Casework Intervention with Persons Who Inject Drugs

Author: Packiaraj, John

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374149?accountid=14925

Abstract: HIV is an unprecedented epidemic & a public health emergency. In many resource poor countries & among marginalised groups of people, the number of new infections is on the rise. Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) have now become a significant risk group for the HIV infection & play a major role in its transmission. Harm reduction is the need of the hour. Although IDUs are a hard to reach population, social casework intervention yields good results. Networking with people & institutions is the need of the time. This article presents social casework intervention with IDUs & reflections based on work experience. References. Adapted from the source document.

Scripting Survival, Irony and Vulnerability: Reflections on Civil Society Responses to the Mumbai Floods

Author: Nagaraj, Vijay K11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India vijay@tiss.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61348087?accountid=14925

Abstract: Personal experiences before, during, & after the floods in Mumbai (Maharashtra), India, are drawn on to analyze the role of the state & nonstate actors in recovery efforts following such natural disasters. The notion that the Mumbai floods were a "humanitarian crisis" is deemed "absurdly reductionist," arguing that "the suffering was natural, but the disaster entirely man-made." Blame is placed squarely on the multilevel failures of the city's public & civic agencies that were supposed to be responsible for health & development, not on their failure to perform, but on their inability to protect lives & property, failures that led both directly & indirectely to mass human rights violations. The activities of various nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in disaster relief are described, noting their inability or unwillingness to address the issue of shelter. The role of the author's affiliation -- the Tata Instit of Social Sciences (TISS) -- in coordinating the services of local NGOs & community organizations, the government, & the media in relief efforts is described. It is argued that the involvement of organizations such as TISS requires a critical understanding of the socioeconomic & political contexts of contemporary disasters. K. Hyatt Stewart

Attitude towards Corruption: Causal Model and Path Analysis

Author: Sengupta, P B11 Dept Post-Graduate Studies & Research Sociology & Social Work, Rani Durgawati U, Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391036?accountid=14925

Abstract: Corruption is a complex social problem & is present in both developed & developing countries. What is the cause of corrupt practices in some of the government offices in our country? Is it an indifferent office environment with some personnel having a corrupt disposition & who induce others? Or is the office environment itself charged with 'corruption-potential' that whoever enters that establishment picks up the habit in due course? It is difficult to probe into the causes & this study is an attempt to scratch at the surface of the hard-to-crack social problem. A difficult topic to research, due to its very nature, the small sample structure of this study is a drawback. The article does not make any tall claims; rather, the comments are open for revision. 18 Tables, 1 Figure, 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

On Science and the Human Condition: An Essay at the Interface

Author: Mohan, Brij11 School Social Work, Louisiana State U, Baton Rouge

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390060?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article seeks to unravel certain fallacies of development that legitimise spurious scientificity; analyze epistemic & organizational conundrums that impede knowledge production; challenge scientists in general, & social scientists in particular, to redefine social as a unified construct of human-social development. The analysis of these three objectives helps signify the role of science & technology in deconstructing an interdisciplinary dialogue as a stepping stone toward global social transformation. 2 Figures, 21 References.

Abstract: The article seeks to examine the factors affecting the caregiver's appraisal of caring for a mentally ill relative. Two hundred & ten caregivers attending to a family member with chronic mental illness were interviewed for the present study. The results of path analysis indicate burden experienced in the context of caregiving, patient's illness characteristics, & kinship support to be the most significant factors contributing to the caregiver's appraisal of the caregiving experience. Implications of the findings were summarized. 3 Figures, 1 Chart, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

Empowerment-Based Social Work Practice: Issues and Challenges

Author: Hossen, Mohammad Abul11 Faculty Social Work, Wilfrid Laurier U, Waterloo

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374131?accountid=14925

Abstract: All social work activity is concerned with social problems, that is, with alleviating, eliminating, or preventing social problems & the deleterious effects they have on people. It works with the people, organizations & groups who are marginalised, depressed, disadvantaged, powerless & voiceless. Its mission is to change society from one that creates & perpetuates poverty, inequality, & humiliation to one more consistent with social work's fundamental values of humanism & egalitarianism. In order to provide meaningful support to the client, social workers need to empower them. It is often argued that the key to rectifying common people's situation is the empowerment of those who are excluded from the development process & then to build political, economic & social structures which are more participatory & inclusive in nature. But this task is not easy as multiple factors & challenges are involved with this process. This article tries to discuss the various issues & strategies relating to empowerment process. The findings of the article confess that in order to develop social work as a competent profession, empowerment is not only needed for the client, but it is equally needed for the social work professionals themselves. 35 References.

Corporate Social Responsibility in the Globalised Business Environment

Author: Pradhan, Pitabas1; Parida, Subhas C; Rath, Babani P1 Dept Journalism & Mass Communication, Aligarh Muslim U, Uttar Pradesh, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61364678?accountid=14925

Abstract: The notion held by many corporate executives in the earlier decades of the twentieth century that 'the business of business is business' has changed substantially. They have realized that earning more & more profit alone is not sufficient for business survival -- they have some responsibility towards society & the communities in which they operate. As such, corporate social responsibility is viewed not as an expense but as an investment that results in long-term profit. For an organization, the community it operates in is very important as it supplies a major part of the organization's work force, raw materials, & provides an environment to prosper or perish. Community relations programmes are an outcome of the realization that organizations cannot survive in an island of affluence surrounded by a community, deprived of the minimum facilities of civilized life. There are a variety of ways in which an organization can involve itself in community relations & in bettering community life. This article explores the different dimensions of community relations practice by taking NALCO as a case study. 7 Tables, 1 Figure, 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

Socioeconomic Status of Scavengers Engaged in the Practice of Manual Scavenging in Maharashtra

Author: Beck, H1; Darokar, Shaileshkumar1 Dept Urban & Rural Community Development, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391209?accountid=14925

Abstract: The socioeconomic status of people who practice manual scavenging in Maharashtra, India, is studied to develop policy programs for enhancing the socioeconomic status of such individuals. After providing an overview of legislation designed to curtail manual scavenging, the methodology used to ascertain the number of manual scavenging households in Maharashtra is detailed. Several findings are reported including the number of scavenging households, the various scavenging activities performed by individuals, the income generated by scavenging activities, & the caste identification of scavengers. Sundry recommendations for reducing manual scavenging throughout the region are highlighted including initiating programs for liberating & rehabilitating manual scavengers, utilizing improved construction techniques in the design of dry latrines, using suction technology to sanitarily remove excrement from dry latrines, extending the government's provision of benefits to Muslim manual scavengers, & prioritizing the educational & occupational needs of scavengers' children. It is concluded that the state has failed to monitor extant scavenging legislation & that improved enforcement is necessary to enhance scavenging households' quality of life. J. W. Parker

Learning 'at Work' during Social Work Education: An Example of Practice Learning Opportunities from Sweden

Author: Bolin, Anette11 Dept Social Work & Behavioural Studies, U West, Trollhattan, Sweden Anette.bolin@hv.se

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61383826?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this article is to describe & analyse the learning processes of Swedish social work students during & after periods of workplace-based learning. The article describes the process in which the practice learning opportunities that the students have been involved in are reflected upon, discussed, problematised & theorised, both in a series of workshops & via the process of the narrative description of critical incidents. Practice learning opportunities form an integral part of studies of social work in the Social Pedagogy program at the University West in Sweden, where a reflective approach to both campus & practice learning has been developed. In presenting the analysis of the reflective approach to studies of social work the article draws on both Scandinavian & international research & presents Saljo's theory of situated learning & Nielsen & Kvale's theory of Mesterlaerer in the analysis of the critical incident narratives of two individual social work students.

Should you encourage students to assess themselves in practice learning? A guided self-efficacy approach to practice learning assessment

Author: Parker, Jonathan11 Bournemouth University, Institute of Health and Community Studies, 4th Floor, Royal London House, Bournemouth BH1 3LT parkerj@bournemouth.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61359433?accountid=14925

Abstract: Practice learning has assumed a place of central importance in the current qualifying education for social work in the UK. This paper seeks to explore whether students should be encouraged to contribute to the process of assessment and, assuming that they should, how this might be achieved. A self-efficacy model is proposed as a means of students assessing themselves and creating a constructive dialogue on their progress and development as beginning social workers.

Developing a Model for Supervising Social Work Students in Groups

Abstract: Much is written about group supervision in other health care fields; however less attention is paid to this topic in social work. This lack of scholarly attention became obvious to the author when he attempted to begin supervising students in groups & was unable to reference a suitable model or template of group supervision from which to gain ideas or direction. The author therefore decided to develop his own model of group supervision. The following article gives an account of how the author developed this model by critically appraising the relevant policy & theory from a local & national perspective to inform his practice.

Abstract: This paper sets out to explore the implementation of Personal Development Planning both in university and professional practice settings for community health nurses, as an action research project. This was achieved through a series of cycles of implementation, review and modification using a collaborative approach. The introduction of this process into the course design has enabled all those involved to record student progress in an effective manner. Our findings show that community health students and their assessors in practice have found the experience a very positive one and as a result some "tips for best practice" have been developed that will help take the process further.

Back to School for Social Work Students: Developing Quality Practice Learning Opportunities in Schools

Author: Wilson, Lynne1; Hillison, Karen1 Hull School Health & Social Care, U Lincoln

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391685?accountid=14925

Abstract: Every Child Matters: Change for children (DfES, 2004) places effective inter-professional working at the top of the child care agenda. Developing new opportunities for practice learning in different professional settings, therefore, is high on the agenda for all those concerned with the teaching of social work. Learning within a different professional setting can bring many benefits, but also challenges. This article outlines a well-established project in Hull, where student social workers have been experiencing practice learning opportunities in mainstream schools for the past four years. The project has been evaluated using an action research model & as such reflects the subsequent development & consolidation as the project has expanded. We highlight both the benefits & the challenges for all those concerned with these placements, addressing some of the issues for students, practice teachers, & work-based supervisors in their roles in this new approach.

Author: Douglas, Harry1; Byrne, Mel1 Training and Development Unit, Southern Health and Social Services Board, 41 Abbey Street, Armagh BT61 7DY North Ireland harry.douglas@shssb.n-i.nhs.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61353524?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work academic institutions and social work agencies in Northern Ireland, in common with counterparts in England, Wales and Scotland, have been working hard to meet the challenges of developing and delivering the academic and practice learning components of the new Degree in Social work. This article highlights a number of developments which have occurred in Northern Ireland. Using findings from recent local research and the authors' own knowledge and insights, some of the broader implications of these developments are discussed and their capacity for learning and transferability is identified. Adapted from the source document.

Teaching Letters

Author: Cooper, Lesley11 School Social Administration & Social Work, Flinders U, Adelaide, Australia Lesley.Cooper@flinders.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61358710?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents a hypothetical series of letters from an anonymous social work student at Flinders University describing their learning. The student is writing to Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de la Brede et de Montesquieu, in keeping with the Baron's famous, anonymously published Lettres persanes (Persian Letters). The student's letters highlight the progress of education in general & social work education in particular from the 18h Century to the present time. They illustrate the author's approach to teaching & learning, & some of her strategies for effectively teaching social planning & social work ethics. Montesquieu wrote his Lettres persanes in 1721 as a vehicle for commenting on life & culture in contemporary France. This paper presents a series of hypothetical letters to Montesquieu from a social work student at Flinders University describing her learning. These letters were presented at the Australian Universities Teaching Committee National Teaching Forum in 2002 to convey the educator's approach to teaching. While the letters conclude with a peroration in which the educator outlines the conceptual framework underlying her teaching, the article concludes with a reply from 'Montesquieu' on the letters & the student's response. References. Adapted from the source document.

Back to the Future: Evaluating a Project to Disseminate Practice Learning and Teaching in Ukraine

Author: Ambler, Steve; Black, Adrian

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395745?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports on an experience of training social work practice educators in the Chernihiv law College in northern Ukraine. The purpose of the visit was to examine whether the UK values critical to UK social work training were able to transfer to other cultures. During their visit, the authors taught a five-day module on practice learning & used research tools of questionnaire, structural interviews & focus groups to collate & analyse data that sought to examine the transferability of values. Positive changes to practice teaching were brought about as a result of their visit. References. Adapted from the source document.

The Path to Partnership: A New Model for Understanding University-Community Partnerships

Author: Gass, Eric

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716539?accountid=14925

Abstract: There have been several attempts by different teams of researchers to define the characteristics of community-campus partnerships. The primary focus of this article is to look at the essential dimensions community-campus partnerships. The dimensions that each research group has developed will be presented. Following that, a new model will be proposed, integrating the dimensions that have been identified across the existing models. After the presentation of the new model, each dimension within the model will be defined, the five essential dimensions of partnership will be elaborated upon, and the interrelationships among the dimensions will be outlined. Adapted from the source document.

A Model for a Pro-Active and Progressive University-Community Partnership

Author: Fasenfest, David; Grant, Larry

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716543?accountid=14925

Abstract: Community redevelopment in a coherent and long-term manner that addresses the needs of its residents is a core agenda for many University projects. After briefly recounting the relationship of universities to their communities we identify what we call 'University against Community' and 'University with Community' initiatives -- the former in response to the university's agenda while the latter reflects that of the community. We argue that an effective University-Community Partnership must be of the latter variety, and must exhibit comprehensiveness, synchrony, integration, long-term perspective, and inclusiveness if it is to be truly transformative. We offer a proposal for a University-Community Partnership that has been developed in collaboration with University faculty and the active participation of community stakeholders. Focused primarily on food and nutrition, this proposed program known as the Lishe Compact involves faculty and students, coordinates community agencies, and pools limited resources to improve interagency planning, builds local capacity, and engages residents in rebuilding the community. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article describes the implementation and evaluation of the Resource Mentoring Project, a university-community partnerships that aims to build organizational capacity in grassroots community and faith-based organizations. Using a casework approach in which an organization is the 'client,' RMP staff provide client agencies with access to a network of technical assistance providers, a capacity assessment tool, a tailored action plan for organizational development, and a match with organizational mentors that helped agencies build capacity in needed areas. The efforts yielded positive outcomes for many of the agencies and several important lessons for successful grassroots organizational capacity building. Adapted from the source document.

The Role of Leadership Development in Addressing Urban Community Challenges

Author: Musewicz, John; Pickron-Davis, Marcine; Harris, James T; Marczyk, Geoffrey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716550?accountid=14925

Abstract: Widener University is an independent, metropolitan, doctoral granting institution whose main campus is located in Chester, Pennsylvania. Widener is committed to addressing the region's most pressing concerns by contributing to the vitality and well-being of the local community. Chester is a distressed city of 36,000 residents, and this leadership development initiative targeted members of the Sun Hill community, which is located within Chester and adjacent to Widener. Sun Hill residents reflect a multitude of diversity in terms of age, race, and resident status. Quality of life issues, such as trash, curfew violations, drug-related violence, and a general increase in crimes involving theft of property and violence have pervaded the community. This leadership development initiative was designed to catalyze neighborhood revitalization by enhancing the leadership skills of Sun Hill residents, helping them to contribute to the recreation of a viable community. Components of the leadership training included recruiting participants, assessing their leadership strengths and developmental needs, and delivering classroom based training and individualized coaching sessions. Analysis of aggregate data collected during the program indicated that participants have levels of emotional intelligence (an important contributor to effective leadership skill) comparable to the general population, but do not yet have the level of leadership competency exhibited by successful managers in corporate America. Discussion of these results and the program is provided, and conclusions and recommendations are made. Adapted from the source document.

University-Community Collaborations: A Case Study of an Effective Partnership

Author: Pardasani, Manoj

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716553?accountid=14925

Abstract: University-Community collaboration have become integral to the overarching missions of educational institutions nationwide. While this trend has always existed in schools of social work, to some extent, this current debate has encouraged the schools to re-assess their commitment to empowerment, advocacy and social action in the context of the communities in which they are located. This article presents a case study of a productive, meaningful and mutually beneficial partnership established between a community coalition and a school of social work. This partnership was initiative without any fiscal incentive, but prospered due to the commitment of the school and individual faculty members. The joint project implemented, the benefits and challenges of initiating and maintaining such collaborations, and lessons learned from this experience are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Young African American males exhibit resilience and strength despite being bombarded by numerous obstacles and barriers. The purpose of this article is to discuss a university/faith-based collaborative project, the "Canaan Conference Project," that was aimed at empowering young African American males toward academic achievement through life skills presentations by adult African American males who served as role models. This collaborative is a model for replication by others in social work and closely related professions. Adapted from the source document.

Role Changes, Learning Enhancements and Professional Development Through a University-School Collaborative

Author: Austin, Sandra; Briar-Lawson, Katherine; King-Ingham, Alice; Spicer, Jerry; Davis, Dorinda

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716558?accountid=14925

Abstract: Engaged Universities position Schools of Social Work to be campus hubs for new kinds of outreach scholarship, pedagogy and programming. This case study reports on one facet of the outreach work undertaken by a School of Social Work with its neighboring elementary school in an urban, inner city community. It delineates ways that professional development can emerge when social workers and teachers collaborate to addressing barriers to learning. Outreach pedagogy positioned students in several macro practice classes to acquire community-building skills. Outcomes from the pedagogical, outreach and capacity building work are reported along with recommendation for further development such as evaluation research. Adapted from the source document.

University Agency Collaboration to Design, Implement, and Evaluate a Leadership Development System

Author: Packard, Thomas; Tucker-Tatlow, Jennifer; Waechter, Jessica; Rahiser, Patti; Dudley, Donald E

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716561?accountid=14925

Abstract: A collaboration between two schools of social work and nine county human service organizations has provided opportunities for university service to communities and organizations, research for the counties, and the enrichment of university curricula. University staff facilitate and provide staff support for quarterly meetings of the nine directors, and have completed several action research projects for them. A leadership development initiative to chance succession planning for the departments has successfully developed 24 of their staff interested in promoting to executive management. The program and its evaluation finding are presented here, followed by lessons learned which may be useful to other collaborations. For the past four years, two schools of social work (San Diego State University and California State University, San Bernardino) have been engaged in an ongoing collaboration with the directors of nine county human service organizations in Southern California. The purpose of this paper is to present some of products, models, and lessons learned from this ongoing collaboration. Specifically, several major research and training projects have provided valuable technical assistance and capacity building for the nine involved organizations. One project in particular, a leadership development initiative, will be presented in detail as an example of training for organizational leadership. Research designs used included qualitative, quantitative, and case study methods. The knowledge gained from the projects has been useful not only to the involved agencies but also to university faculty, in the form of knowledge and insights about agency practice which have informed curriculum development in a social work administration concentration. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Professional Education and Workforce Development: A Ladder of Learning

Author: Morris, Teresa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1322716563?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article suggests that university based social work programs can collaborate with work place based academies to create a new model of social work professional education providing life-long learning from high school to the doctoral level. A "ladder of learning" is proposed linking educational levels, competencies, work place requirements and organizational change. It is suggested that such a framework gives social work a conceptual tool to identify, discuss and promote educational and work place reform. Adapted from the source document.

Concepts for Contemporary Social Work: Globalization, Oppression, Social Exclusion, Human Rights, Etc.

Author: van Wormer, Katherine11 Dept Social Work, U Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls vanwormer@uni.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373110?accountid=14925

Abstract: The society wrestles with mass social change congruent with economic globalization and the communications revolution. This change creates new challenges for the social work profession in the areas of social and economic justice. This article analyzes the terminology of the new global era, words that signify a paradigm shift in outlook, most of them a reaction to the new authoritarianism of the age. Globalization, oppression, social exclusion, human rights, harm reduction, and restorative justice are the representative terms chosen. References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work, Social Politics and Justice

Author: Sunker, Heinz11 Fachbereich Bildungswissenschaften, Bergische U Wuppertal suenker@uni-wuppertal.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368379?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that the reluctance of social workers to recognize the link between social work & politics has turned the profession into a sort of reproduction process of social inequality. The history of the connection between politics & social work is traced from the beginning of the modern age to the present time. The transition within social work practice from intervention to benefit management is examined, along with the contradictory constitution of the welfare state; the impact of discourses about justice; problems of universalization; the need for an egalitarian society to be free of domination; & the relationship of justice with politics, political conscience, & political action. It is contended that the lack of a political framework is harmful to everyday practice because it forces social workers to accept the political vocabulary, problem definitions, & fiscal restraints of others. Counter strategies to further enforcement of capitalist social formation on a global scale will only succeed if social work & social politics stop contributing to the reproduction of social relationships based on inequalities.

Social Work and the Quality of Life Politics -- A Critical Assessment

Author: Landhausser, Sandra1; Ziegler, Holger1 Center Social Service Studies, Faculty Educational Science, U Bielefeld, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393422?accountid=14925

Abstract: The feature of this paper is a critical assessment of the current discourses about quality of life (QoL) and their implications for Social Work. At first it pictures some major historical backgrounds of the discussion on the improvement of life quality as an aim of societal development. In particular three crucial shifts in the politics of QoL--its 'individualisation', its 'informalisation' and its 'culturalisation'--and their implications for Social Work are critically examined, theoretically and empirically referring to the results of an own community-study. The paper concludes with an alternative suggestion reflecting the idea of an 'autonomy-based' approach of democratic equality. References. Adapted from the source document.

Resisting Postmodernity: Swedish Social Policy in the 1990s

Author: Gould, Arthur11 Dept Social Sciences, Loughborough U, Leicestershire, England Arthur.gould1@btinternet.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377594?accountid=14925

Abstract: Looks at ideas that have emerged in the 1990s about Sweden's welfare state which is considered a prototype of modern society & an exemplar of social engineering/state planning. An overview of global social & economic changes over the last 20 years is intended to provide the context for the supposed system change that occurred in Sweden during the 1990s. The focus is on both the impact of the shift from modernity to postmodernity & the political, institutional, & cultural resistance that has made welfare changes less severe in Sweden than in many other places. The status of women, the elderly, unemployment, substance misuse, & welfare services/benefits between 1991 & 1998 is examined to argue that Sweden exemplified modernity because of its Apollonian culture that is defined by order/form, control, self-restraint, temperance, predictability, reason & rationalism. These traits have enabled Swedish welfare to resist the phenomenon of postmodernity that leans toward Dionysian culture characterized by disorder/chaos; excess; impulsiveness; unpredictability; & irrationality. Positive & negative aspects of Swedish resistance are discussed. References. J. Lindroth

Social Work and a New Social Order -- Challenging Neo-Liberalism's Erosion of Solidarity

Author: Lorenz, Walter11 Faculty Education, Free U Bozen-Bolzano, Italy Walter.Lorenz@unibz.it

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373038?accountid=14925

Abstract: The world in which social work operates today is a very different world from that in which most of us took their social work training, and the changes we are facing are profound. This paper argues that these changes are not merely a regime change in social policy but that they are essentially about a re-ordering of social relationships and attempt to model them on neo-liberal ideas. In view of these pressures it is understandable that social workers often try to ignore those changes and withdraw into a private world of therapeutic relationships in which the methods they trained in are made to be still valid, or they simply go along with new service delivery designs without asking too many questions. Both reactions fail to question what the 'social' can still mean in the light of these changes and how social workers can fulfil their mandate to be responsible for the social dimension of public life. Nothing less than a head-on challenge of the basic presuppositions of neo-liberalism (Willke 2003) and their manifold applications to social service delivery systems will thereby suffice. References.

Just a Tea Stall Girl: Lessons from India

Author: Birkbeck, Jane11 School Social Work & Human Service, Thompson Rivers U, Kamloops, B.C jbirkbeck@tru.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373161?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article charts the learning of a female academic who travelled and volunteered in southern India during a sabbatical leave from her university. Opportunities to discover gender, race and class connections ranged from tea-stall conversations to academic symposia; from outings with impoverished Indian families to excursions with social justice organizations. The author explores topics that include dowry, politics, globalization, communalism, and poverty. To illustrate her learning, she draws on the work of such renowned Indian scholars as Ali Ashgar Engineer and Vandana Shiva. References. Adapted from the source document.

The Development of Social Work as a Speciality and the Profession in Estonia

Author: Kiik, Riina1; Sirotkina, Reeli1 U Tartu, Estonia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61351552?accountid=14925

Abstract: An examination of the development of social work in Estonia notes that social work education has existed since the beginning of the 20th century but was not provided during the 50 years of Soviet occupation when social problems were denied because they were considered an affront to official communist ideology. An overview of social work in Estonia from 1935 to 1990 is followed by a look at significant changes in the system of social assistance since Estonia regained independence in 1991. Special attention is given to the Social Welfare Act of 1995; the status of social work education; & new occupational standards for social workers. Current problems include the need for more professionally educated social workers & the lack of an occupational organization to bring social workers together. Emphasis is placed on the requisite to improve social work education in order to enhance the delivery of social services & increase knowledge about the global processes of social policy.

The Active Subjects of Welfare Reform: A Street-Level Comparison of Employment Services in Australia and Denmark

Author: Marston, Greg1; Larsen, Jorgen Elm; McDonald, Catherine1 School Social Work & Applied Human Sciences, U Queensland, Brisbane, Australia g.marston@socialuq.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378366?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores the similarities & differences between Denmark & Australia in adopting welfare reform activation measures in the field of employment services. In Australia & Denmark the discourse of welfare reform centres the 'activation' of citizens through 'mutual obligation' type requirements. Through various forms of case management, unemployed individuals are encouraged to act upon themselves in creating the right set of ethical dispositions congruent with 'active citizenship'. At the same time any resistance to heightened conditionality on the part of the unemployed person is dealt with through a range of coercive & disciplinary techniques. A comparative case study between these two countries allows us to consider how similar ideas, discourse & principles are shaping policy implementation in countries that have very different welfare state trajectories & institutional arrangements for the delivery of social welfare generally & employment services specifically. & in research terms, a comparison between a Nordic welfare state & an Anglo-Saxon welfare state provides an opportunity to critically examine the utility of 'welfare regime' type analyses & the neo-liberal convergence thesis in comparative welfare research. On the basis of empirical analysis, the article concludes that a single focus on abstract typologies or political ideologies is not very helpful in getting the measure of welfare reform (or any other major policy development for that matter). At the 'street-level' of policy practice there is considerably more ambiguity, incoherence & contradiction than is suggested by linear accounts of welfare reform. References.

Workfare Work: The Impact of Workfare on the Worker/Client Relationship

Author: Handler, Joel F11 School Public Policy & Social Research, U California, Los Angeles handler@law.ucla.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61394409?accountid=14925

Abstract: An examination of the history of welfare reform in the US focuses on how the implementation of workfare programs has affected the relationship between clients & their social workers. The burdens that have historically faced social welfare offices are described along with the difficulties involved in having to execute programs that emphasize compliance & eligibility while simultaneously being responsible for the implementation of workfare programs which require intensive personal case management. Strategies used by welfare offices to deal with these contradictory expectations are explored. Steven Luke's three dimensions of power (1974) are drawn upon to explain how clients react to workfare programs & why they acquiesce to workfare contracts in spite of unmet needs. It is suggested that workfare programs could succeed if the client were allowed to become the subject rather than the object. Four steps are needed to make this happen: 1) workers must be rewarded for client success; 2) workfare offices must be separated from benefits offices; 3) sanctions should be eliminated; 4) a Basic Income Guarantee must be instituted.

The Deprofessionalisation Thesis, Accountability and Professional Character

Author: Clark, Chris11 School Social & Political Studies, U Edinburgh, UK Chris.Clark@ed.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373217?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is said that the deprofessionalisation of social work & other welfare occupations reduces workers' professional discretion & autonomy, & thus their capacity to act in the best interests of their client. Without necessarily regarding the deprofessionalisation thesis as conclusive, this paper will ask how the state's control of the role & task of social workers impacts on their role-implicated obligations as professionals. If workers are reduced (as claimed) to the status of mere functionaries in systems they neither approve of nor control, does this exonerate them from bad outcomes or service failures? How should we view the dramatic increase in formal regulation now seen in the UK--as professionalisation or deprofessionalisation? The paper will argue that whatever the drift of policy, workers remain in some measure personally accountable. Service failures imply faults of practical reason that are partly attributable to the moral & intellectual character of professionals as individuals. It is therefore up to professionals, & their organisations, to attend to the improvement of professional character. References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work as Laboratory for Normative Professionalisation

Author: Kunneman, Harry11 U Humanistiek, Utrecht, Netherlands w-mail: hk@uvh.nl

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61399869?accountid=14925

Abstract: In most Western countries, the professional status of social workers is unstable & insecure. Of course, most Western countries are themselves unstable, ridden with feelings of insecurity & in search of reassurance & promises of control. But social work hardly lends itself as a projection screen for visions of professional control & efficiency in the face of insecurity. On the contrary: within the present cultural & political climate, social work connotes primarily with unpopular social problems, with people unable to cope adequately with the competitiveness & the rate of change of post-industrial societies; that is to say: it connotes more with dependency & helplessness then with autonomy & control. Moreover, whereas public discourse in most Western country is dominated by a neo-liberal perspective & the intricate network of economic, managerial, consumerist & military metaphors connected with it, social work still carries with it a legacy of 'progressive politics' increasingly labeled as outdated & inadequate. Although the values of solidarity & social justice connected with this 'progressive heritage' certainly have not faded away completely, the loudest & most popular voices on the level of public discourse keep underscoring the necessity to adapt to the 'realities' of present-day postindustrial societies & their dependence on economic growth, technological innovation & the dynamics of an ever more competitive world-market. This 'unavoidable' adaptation involves both the 'modernization' & progressive diminishment of 'costly' welfare-state arrangements & a radical reorientation of social work as a profession. Instead of furthering the dependency of clients in the name of solidarity, social workers should stimulate them to face their own responsibilities & help them to function more adequately in a world where individual autonomy & economic progress are dominant values. This shift has far-reaching consequences for the organization of the work itself. Efficiency & transparency are the new code words, professional autonomy is dramatically limited & interventions of social workers are increasingly bound to 'objective' standards of success & cost-effectiveness.

Decentralisation and Social Services in England

Author: Lorenz, Walter11 Facolta Scienze Formazione, Libera U Bolzano, Italia Walter.Lorenz@unibz.it

Abstract: Although Great Britain is not normally credited with the achievement of having been the first nation state to implement measures characteristic of a welfare state (this honour goes to Germany & Bismarck's strategy of promoting social insurance in the 1880s) it nevertheless pioneered many models of welfare services in view of the early onset of industrialisation in that country & the subsequent social problems it created. Organisations like the Mutual Insurance & Friendly Societies, the Charity Organisation Society or the Settlement Movement characterised an early approach to welfare that is based on initiatives at the civil society level & express a sense of self-help or of self-organisation in such a way that it did not involve the state directly. The state, traditionally, dealt with matters of discipline & public order, & for this reason institutions like prisons & workhouses represented the other end of the scale of 'welfare' provisions.

Differences in Internet Usage -- Social Inequality and Informal Education

Author: Iske, Stefan1; Klein, Alexandra; Kutscher, Nadia1 Fakultat Padagogik, U Bielefeld, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395632?accountid=14925

Abstract: Information for an analysis of the implications of digital social inequality for internet education was obtained from 50 structured & surf interviews with young people aged 11 to 23; a quantitative questionnaire completed by 360 persons aged 14-24; & a content analysis of 164 postings on a feedback forum. Consideration was given to how social preconditions influence differences in internet use; the impact of technical equipment & social sites of access; the relationship between real life & virtual space; & preconditions needed to open new educational spaces on the internet. It was found that both social differences & processes of appropriation have an impact on online use. Challenges for the development of informal internet educational arrangements posed by differences based on social inequalities are pointed out. Although the digital divide tends to diminish with technical access, differences in usage of the internet remain largely unchanged. Emphasis is placed on the need to create & enhance online services that overcome inequalities in access/usage while structurally providing a space for education. References. J. Lindroth

Social Work and the Bologna Process

Abstract: As social work training in Europe is characterized by progressive 'academisation' it is directly affected by the changes in university structures triggered by the Bologna Process. This means, however, simultaneously that all the ambiguities surrounding social work education, such as the level & rank it has achieved as an independent academic discipline, the relationship between theory & practice & the duality of training patterns at university & non-university institutions, are becoming more starkly apparent & need to be addressed with renewed urgency in practically all countries that have subscribed to the transformation initiative.

Mothering Children or Soldiers: Advancing Paradigms of the Women's Movement in Former Yugoslavia

Author: Swindell, Marian11 Social Work Division, Mississippi State U, Meridian Mswindell@meridian.msstate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61399913?accountid=14925

Abstract: The transition of political power in former Yugoslavia & the wars that followed have led to the country's reassessment of the proper role of women in society, culture, nation, & family. Advocates of a new vision of nationalist womanhood assert that the continued existence of the entire country depends solely on women carrying out their reproductive & nurturing roles. This new envisioning clearly serves a political purpose, solely at the expense of the women's movement, which has made significant strides in this nation. It is the purpose of this article to provide a brief historical overview of the development of the new idealized "mother of the nation" from a strengths-based social work perspective. References.

Why Freeter and NEET are Misunderstood: Recognizing the New Precarious Conditions of Japanese Youth

Author: Inui, Akio11 Faculty Humanities & Social Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan U, Hachiohji-shi jbb03316@nifty.ne.jp

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61385783?accountid=14925

Abstract: In developed countries, the transition from school to work has radically changed over the past two decades. It has become prolonged, complicated & individualized (Bynner et al., 1997; Walther et al., 2004). Young people used to transition directly from school to stable employment, or with a very short unemployed period. In many European countries, this situation has been changing since the eighties: overall youth unemployment has increased, & many young people experience long periods of unemployment, government training schemes & part-time or temporary jobs. In Japan, this change has taken a decade later to appear, becoming prevalent by the late nineties (Inui, 2003). The transiting process has become not only precarious for young people, but also difficult for society to precisely understand the risks & problems. Traditionally, we have been able to recognize young people's situation by a simple category: in education, employed, in training or unemployed. However, these categories no longer accurately represent young people's state. In Japan, most young people used to move from school directly to full-time employment through the new graduate recruitment system (Inui, 1993). Therefore, in official statistics such as the School Basic Survey, 'employed' includes only those who are in regular employment, while those who are in part-time or temporary work are covered by the categories 'jobless' & 'others'. However, with the increase in non-full-time jobs in the nineties, these categories have become less useful for describing the actual employment conditions of young people. Indeed, this is why, in the late nineties, the Japanese Ministry of Education changed the category name from 'jobless' to 'others'. Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Social & political change in Europe, increasing labour mobility, development of the new European social policy & increasingly global nature of social problems, has had a profound effect on the socio-cultural & socio-educational work in community & on its objectives. In order to keep these new communitarian standards of social policy, the first steps have to be made in fostering local community with the perspective it will reach the western European communitarian level. That is the reason why university in these changes started to turn more & more to the society & first of all has put a great emphasis on the community research. This initiative was induced by non-existence of civic tradition during the communist period, the gap in the development of civil society & its culture, the weakness & the poorness of the third sector. This paper is based on the analysis of the community & civil society research conducted during recent years by the researchers of Kaunas University of Technology, Faculty of Social Sciences. The paper involves a review of the research methodology, interpretation of the received data & summary of the results. It discusses both theoretical & empirical possibilities of building & developing inclusive community. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Iravani, Mohammad Reza1; Ghojavand, Kazem1 Islamic Azad U-Khomeinishahr Branch, Iran

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61385828?accountid=14925

Abstract: Loss, grief & other problems are events that most people experience during their life. Earthquakes are disasters that make people experience these problems simultaneously. These crises affect survivors as much as other dangers in their lives. Thus, most of them need to be supported until they can solve their problems & do their daily activities. We know that the aim of social work is to assist individuals who are seeking help. But there is a problem: how must social workers help their clients efficiently? Especially, those clients who are victims of earthquakes? To this end, the present paper tries to describe the process of social casework & those skills required for social workers to help these survivors. These skills include: situational supporting, hopefulness making, consoling, assuring, concentrating, developing solutions & referring. Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work and Refugees

Author: Joseph, Sherry11 Futures Group, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61392046?accountid=14925

Abstract: The post Second World War period witnessed an ever increasing 'Fourth World' population -- the refugees & internally displaced persons. More than viewing refugees from a humanitarian perspective, work with the refugee population is now guided from the right's perspective. The case study of the Bangladesh refugees in West Bengal is a good example of social action strategies. Social work in India has been addressing the issues of the refugees in a fragmented manner. This article proposes a more comprehensive approach to the problems of refugees from an individual, group & community perspective. 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Doing Good but Making It Work: A Reflective Commentary on the Past Fifty Years

Author: Newman, Edward11 Temple U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433575?accountid=14925

Abstract: National social planning ideas in the 1960s, & even before, were spearheaded by prominent social workers whose impetus came, in part, from 1962 social service amendments to federal public welfare legislation. Civil rights activities, urban disturbances, President Kennedy's 'New Frontier' & President Johnson's 'War on Poverty' heightened federal attention to the local scene. Although many initiatives were short-lived, their political & managerial problems drew attention to a new focus upon accountability in human services. Team processes, client participation & service outputs in targeted communities refocused energies in the 1970s & l980s. Since the l990s some core social work values have been challenged. Practitioners & managers at the start of the 21st century can promote consumer preferences & locally initiated planned change, consistent with the profession's reform traditions. 28 References.

Author: Csikai, Ellen L1; Raymer, Mary1 School Social Work, U Alabama, Tuscaloosa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61517932?accountid=14925

Abstract: In response to the educational needs of social workers for competence in end-of-life care, a data-driven continuing education curriculum was developed, pilot-tested, & evaluated using multiple methods. A one-day seminar covered a range of topics, & was delivered primarily by a team of practitioners experienced in end-of-life & palliative care. Attendees rated both the comprehensiveness of content & effectiveness of delivery approach high, in the course evaluation, & suggested expansion of the curriculum into a two-day seminar to allow for additional content & more time for discussion. 4 Tables, 10 References.

Innovative Exchange Creates Global Continuing Education

Author: Borland, Kathleen Landreth1; Hockensmith, Janice M1 Circuit Court Cook County, Chicago, IL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61535300?accountid=14925

Abstract: In a world that is simultaneously interconnected by technology & fragmented by cultural divisions, social workers face common professional challenges. NASW Illinois Chapter's International Activities Network addresses those common challenges & creates global continuing education. The Network's exchange programs give social workers an opportunity for "cultural discourse" to improve social services worldwide. Seasoned professionals often reexamination their assumptions, belief systems, & professional strategies. This article describes the development of this innovative program that has brought more than 600 social work professionals together from the United States, Germany, England, & South Africa.

The Views of NASW Members in One State toward Social Action

Author: Dickinson, Janet C11 Western Carolina U, Cullowhee, NC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61528097?accountid=14925

Abstract: This 2003 survey of one state's NASW members explores the relationships between attitudes about social action & various demographic variables. The response rate was 41%. There was strong support for social action on the part of individuals, the profession, & social welfare agencies. Social action tactics involving demonstrations & strikes had minimal support while serving as expert advisor, writing letters to editors, speaking to lay groups, organizing client groups, & contacting policy makers had strong approval. Recommendations are made for stronger social action training in BSW & MSW programs & in continuing education programs for social workers. 11 Tables, 1 Figure, 25 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61557721?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is a growing recognition of the importance of exchanges between social workers from different countries, but the reciprocity of such exchanges is controversial. This paper describes an international exchange program that included a mediated cultural immersion & facilitated a reciprocal encounter between western & non-western professionals. Factors that enabled the successful encounter & conditions needed for the replication of such programs in other settings are delineated & discussed. 3 Tables, 36 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Ellett, Alberta J1; Millar, Kenneth I1 School Social Work, U Georgia, Athens aellett@arches.uga.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433572?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study was designed to understand linkages between new measures of professional organizational culture & employees' intentions to remain employed in child welfare. A survey was administered to all professional staff in two states, & 941 useable surveys were analyzed. The findings provide additional support for the validity of the measures & confirmed the hypothesized linkages between dimensions of professional organizational culture & intentions to remain employed. Implications of the findings for the professional development of supervisors & administrators to strengthen organizational culture in three areas (administrative support, professional sharing among subordinates, & articulating vision & professional commitment) are discussed. 35 References. Adapted from the source document.

Writing Apprehension among Social Workers: Addressing Internal and Structural Barriers to Writing about What We Do

Author: Hernandez, Virginia Rondero1; Dole, Robert; Chavkin, Nancy Feyl1 Dept Social Work Education, California State U, Fresno

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61551762?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article features the results of a survey of social work practitioners who voluntarily attended "Writing About What You Do" workshops at professional conferences. The workshop objectives were to sensitize participants to the individual experience of writing, to identify obstacles & supports for writing through the use of a standardized instrument, & to help participants reframe field experiences into a written format. On the basis of the outcomes of these professional workshops, the authors offer recommendations for continuing education activities that address internal & structural barriers to writing & facilitate confidence in the act of writing about one's practice experiences. 3 Tables, 27 References.

Self-Plagiarism as a Social Work Concern

Author: Cheung, Monit1; Driver, Demori Currid1 Graduate School Social Work, U Houston, TX mcheung@uh.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61400566?accountid=14925

Abstract: Publication ethics in social work have received very little attention. As the research base of the field continues to expand, & as the pressure to publish among academic faculty increases, social work researchers need to examine the ethical issues that can arise in scientific publication, including self-plagiarism & redundant publication. This article examines the issue of self-plagiarism, including "salami-slicing," "text recycling," & duplicate submission. Noting that many researchers may be unaware of publication guidelines, manuscript submission policies were reviewed for 28 major social work journals. Of the journals, 71.43% (n=20) explicitly prohibited simultaneous submissions, & 67.86% (n=19) clearly stated that submitted manuscripts were required to be original. Suggestions are provided to help social work researchers avoid committing intentional & unintentional acts of self-plagiarism & redundant publication. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387262?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study evaluates a reality therapy group for students enrolled in the Form 1 classes of a low-band secondary school in Hong Kong who have exhibited signs of disaffection such as apathy toward study & school activities, repeated academic failure & disruptive classroom behaviour. The results, based on interviews with members & their teachers, indicate significant improvements in the self-esteem, life satisfaction & school performance of the adolescent participants. The results from a self-report evaluation questionnaire also show the members' satisfaction & their positive perceptions of the group in terms of goal attainment & the impact the group has had on them.

Abstract: This paper, based on a sample survey, analysed the social network of the marginal groups including the poor, the un-employed & people with unstable jobs in Hong Kong. The quantity & quality of social capital of the above groups were measured according to the size & homogeneity of their social network. Results showed that the size of social network of the poor was significantly smaller than that of the non-poor, especially in the network of job searching. This suggests that the social capital of the poor was less than that of the non-poor. It is more likely that the social network of the poor was constituted of the un-employed, that was why it was more homogenous. Social network of the un-employed & people with unstable jobs was smaller than that of the people with stable jobs. The un-employed or unstable job holders also induced homogeneity in their social network, the impact of which was greater on male than female. To alleviate the problem of poverty in Hong Kong, we should increase the social capital of the deprived people. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Impacts of SARS Crisis on Social Work Students -- Reflection on Social Work Education

Author: Man, Lam Ching-Man1; Hung, Wong; Terry, Leung Tse-Fong1 Dept Social Work, Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin chingmanlam@cuhk.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396662?accountid=14925

Abstract: The impacts of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on the social work students were examined using a combined quantitative & qualitative method. A survey was conducted with 114 social work undergraduate students at The Chinese University of Hong Kong to assess their perception of the impacts of SARS on them at personal & professional level. Four focus groups had been conducted to examine the social work students' interpretation & their reflection of their experience. Results show that the SARS crisis has positive impacts on social work students. The findings indicate that students with direct exposure to SARS perceived themselves as becoming more appreciative in attitude & have greater involvement & devotion to the social work profession. Moreover, the result shows that three variables -- recognition of risk, commitment & devotion, & professional reflection are positively correlated. The findings articulate the relationship between experience (risk), profession reflection & meaning generation (commitment & devotion). The findings of this study provide us with insights to rethink on our social work education. Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

"Strength" Community -- The Role of Community Development Services in SARS

Author: Kwok-Kin, Fung1; Suet-Lin, Hung1 Division Social Studies, City U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396715?accountid=14925

Abstract: Studies on disaster have been criticised as putting too much emphasis on individual therapy. The community perspective highlights the significance of the sociopolitical factors in causing disasters & intervention at the community level. This paper, examining the contribution of community development services during the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, reveals the significance of establishing an extensive network of vulnerable groups & community organising groundwork in times of crisis. Intervention during the SARS crisis included crisis intervention, providing community education, promoting community care, community participation & supporting the unemployed. After SARS, the focus was on reinforcing the spirit of mutual help, anti-discrimination & reconstructing positive shared meanings of the disaster. In mobilising community resources, the concept of the "strength" community has been confirmed. The SARS experience has revealed that, although disasters are becoming complex & global, remedies can be found in the local community. Community is an important disaster resource. References.

Abstract: This study examines whether the Rheumatoid Arthritis Self-Management Course is effective in, as well as being able to achieve stabilizing effect on, enhancing participants' perception of control over the symptoms, improving health behaviours & health status, & reducing use of health care resources. This is a single group pre-&-post design with a sample of 70 participants. After the intervention & at 1 month follow up, participants show significant improvements in arthritis self-efficacy, self-management behaviour (exercise, cognitive symptoms management & communication with doctors), psychological well-being (sense of helplessness, mood & anxiety) & health status (pain & fatigue). These improvements become stabilized at 6 months follow-up after completion of the program. In addition, the program is found effective in reducing visits to general physician on problems related to arthritis. The results in this study clearly indicate that this community based patient education program can offer substantial benefits for the participants, particularly in terms of perceived self-efficacy on managing various aspects of arthritis, the establishment of positive health behaviour & its stabilizing effects. Therefore the complementary role of patient self-management education to traditional disease-oriented medical services can offer a valuable adjunct to medical care & we strongly advocate for its full implementation.

Overview of Social Science Research in India: An Invitation for Dialogue

Author: Pandey, Vikash N

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61534645?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present note attempts to identify broad trends in social science paradigms, shifts in these paradigms, & their inter-linkages with the social scenario. The central concern is, the "if & how" of inter-linkages between social scientific theories & praxis on the one hand, & the emerging social concerns on the other. Therefore, this note is a historical overview to identify the direction of our movement, the crossroads & gaps that they reflect. 1 Box, 3 References. Adapted from the source document.

Clinical Social Work Research: Quantitative versus Qualitative Methodology

Author: Stanley, Selwyn11 Dept Social Work, Bishop Heber Coll, Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433748?accountid=14925

Abstract: One of the biggest predilections to plague social science research, has been the debate on the use of quantitative analytical procedures vis-a-vis qualitative methodology. Quantitative analysts claim superiority in terms of "scientific" validity & greater generalisability of findings, while the advocates of the qualitative perspective assert greater subjective insight, richness & depth of information, which is likely to be lost in a matrix of numbers. Clinical social work research has, in recent years, shown an overwhelming tendency to list towards the former approach often to the absolute exclusion of qualitative procedures as is evidenced by the numerous publications in the field & the instruments developed to quantify various psychosocial parameters. Several related issues from the stand-point of this paradigm debate have been discussed in this paper besides making out a case for using mixed research methodologies, blending both approaches to the optimum extent possible so as to get the best insight into the phenomenon being investigated. 20 References.

Demographic Transition and Gender Inequalities in Maharashtra

Author: Kanitkar, Tara1; Radkar, Anjali1 Institute Health Management, Pachod, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61526074?accountid=14925

Abstract: With demographic transition, social development has to take place reducing gender inequalities. Demographic transition is almost complete in Maharashtra as it is one of the developed states in India. Unlike transition, gender inequalities cannot be quantified accurately. They have to be studied through the data available on the behavioral patterns of the people. Looking at attitudes of the people as expressed through behavior, an attempt has been made in this article to search for the gender inequalities. Unfortunately, the gap still persists. On the contrary, certain crude indicators like sex ratio even indicate that it has widened. Due to the small family norm & acceptance of terminal methods of contraception immediately after the desired family size is reached, son preference is becoming more visible. Family planning is absolutely women-centered & participation of men is negligible. In spite of an increase in the educational levels of women, as also their participation in the labor force, women get little support from the men, even when they are pregnant. Unless there is gender equity, demographic transition carries no meaning in the true sense. 3 Tables, 38 References. Adapted from the source document.

Socioeconomic Differentials among Major Social and Religious Groups in City Slums

Author: Das, Biswaroop11 Centre Social Studies, Surat, Gujarat, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61517615?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article examines some key socioeconomic differences among the Hindu, Muslim, Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribe population living in the slums of Surat, based on data drawn from a complete enumeration of slumdwellers. The analysis indicates that such settlements are essentially "heterogeneous" in character. The labor market -- especially in the "informal" or "unorganized" sector that draws much of its work force from within such settlements -- gets divided through participation of specific groups & communities in a wide range of jobs within select occupational categories. This reinforces the fragmentation of the urban informal labor market & tends to behave in an "inclusive-exclusive" mode by absorbing labor within specific sectors of immediate as well as larger city economies. 15 Tables, 1 Box, 11 References.

Author: Tiwari, Arvind11 Dept Criminology & Correctional Administration, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61560808?accountid=14925

Abstract: The World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna in June 1993, declared that human rights education, training & public information were essential for stable & harmonious relations among communities. Human rights education implies the entire process of social life through which individuals & social groups learn to develop consciously within -- & for the benefit of national & international communities -- the whole of their personal capacities, attitudes, aptitudes & knowledge. The Government of India & the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) have initiated various programs to impart human rights education at various levels. This article outlines the status of human rights education at various levels & the role of the NHRC to give fillip to human rights education in the country. 12 References.

Implementing Policy Change: Assessing Training Needs in Addictions Treatment and Criminal Justice Collaboratives

Author: Hohman, Melinda1; Weisner, Stanley; Chalmers, Virginia1 School Social Work, San Diego State U, CA mhohman@mail.sdsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61546422?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Substance Abuse & Crime Prevention Act of 2000, passed by CA voters, offers nonviolent drug offenders treatment instead of incarceration. In a training needs assessment, 57 county oversight collaborative teams were interviewed in a focus group format to determine concerns in policy implementation & subsequent training needs. A content analysis of the focus group discussions found that team members were concerned about clients with complex problems, lack of available treatment options, & interagency collaboration. Training needs identified included motivating clients & working in a collaborative fashion due to the multiple agencies involved in the implementation of this act. 4 Tables, 21 References. Adapted from the source document.

CE Online: Use It or Lose It

Author: Dezendorf, Paul K1; Green, Ronald K; Krul, Ronald1 Dept Social Work, Winthrop U, Rock Hill, SC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433060?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes historical periods in the later 30 years of the 20th century in the development of continuing education (CE) in US social work, highlights the flexibility & adaptation of programs to changes, & suggests that the current period contains the greatest challenge to date in the form of CE online. The article suggests that while programs enjoy increased demand they also face greater competition, more specialization, & pressure for lower costs; at the same time, the development of CE online threatens to fundamentally alter their marketplace. The article provides recommendations for reacting to this new reality. 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Urban Migrants and Rural Development

Author: Burman, J. J. Roy1; Das, Rajib1 Unit Research & Consultancy Social Policy & Social Welfare Administration

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61544819?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is a long-standing debate on urbanization & urbanism as a way of life. One view states that due to urban influence, rural migrants feel alienated & get disillusioned. Another view states that rural migrants in urban areas tend to cling together in specific pockets. They form welfare associations to take care of their interests -- mainly saving the slums (where a majority of them dwell), resist eviction by municipal boards, or being exploited by slumlords. There is another type of organization, which is not seen in most of the metropolises & other urban areas. Here, the rural migrants tend to form associations that primarily take care of their housing problems in cities, & also take up developmental activities back in their native villages. After dealing with the concept of urbanism briefly, the article will look into the functioning of a few of the rural development associations formed in Mumbai city. 11 References.

Co-Dependency: Personality Correlates in Spouses of Alcoholics

Author: Stanley, Selwyn11 Dept Social Work, Bishop Heber Coll, Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496190?accountid=14925

Abstract: One hundred & fifty co-dependent spouses of alcoholics were compared with an equal number of wives of non-alcoholics. Instruments to assess their self-esteem, neuroticism, & pessimism were administered. Data analysis showed that the co-dependents had lower self-esteem & manifested greater levels of neuroticism & pessimism than the subjects of the reference group. The findings substantiate the stress hypothesis of co-dependency, which advocates that the stress of living with an alcoholic is responsible for the personality deficits seen in the spouse. Implications for therapeutic intervention have been discussed. 3 Tables, 36 References. Adapted from the source document.

Women Pensioners and Retirement Blues

Author: Pai, Vineeta B11 Dept Social Work, Karnatak U, Dharwad, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61434083?accountid=14925

Abstract: With an increase in the number of women entering the labor market, there is a corresponding increase in the number of women retiring from various job positions. Yet, very little is known about their reactions to retirement or about the implications of retirement. A probe into the lives of these pensioners shows that contrary to the general view that all women alike are happy to retire & relax, a significant number of them either dread retirement or are in an acute dilemma because of socio-psychological or economic reasons. The implications of such dread or dilemmas cannot be ignored for long as they are likely to have far-reaching effects on the quality of life of these retirees. So, alternatives have to be thought of to tackle this issue of women's retirement blues. 4 Tables, 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Utilisation of Primary Health Care Services and Traditional Healing Practices of Lambanis

Author: Patil, Geeta1; Saroja, K1 Dept Human Development, Rural Home Science Coll, U Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, Karnataka, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61434080?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study was conducted using data collected from 75 married Lambani respondents from randomized tandas of Gadag Taluka in Gadag District, Karnataka, regarding their traditional healing remedies. The opinion of four purposively selected, qualified & practicing doctors about these home remedies were then taken. A pre-tested interview schedule, an interview guide, personal observation & an interview schedule for doctors were the tools of data collection. Results revealed that only one tanda had a primary health center & auxiliary nurse midwives were found to visit the tandas rarely. More than 50% of the respondents did not use government health services. Respondents were found to use several traditional remedies for their illnesses & the illnesses of their neonates. Some of these home remedies were approved as effective by all four doctors. The results also implied the need to improve government health facilities, as well as an urgent need for identifying, validating, & propagating effective home remedies. 3 Tables, 4 References.

Globalized Consumer Culture: Its Implications for Social Justice and Practice Teaching in Social Work

Author: Besthorn, Fred H11 Dept Social Work, U Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396125?accountid=14925

Abstract: Globalised consumer culture & its corresponding ethos that accumulation of material possessions equates to happiness are having a profound impact on the physical, social & emotional health of human beings. For social work practitioners & field educators the issue is how we balance the charge to serve our clients without unwittingly forcing them into a system that is designed by its very nature to increase their dissatisfaction & alienation. This essay discusses these concerns & offers some initial suggestions for how social work may respond. References. Adapted from the source document.

Working towards Culturally Sensitive Ethical Practice in a Multicultural Society

Author: Weber, Zita11 School Social Work & Policy Studies, U Sydney, Australia z.weber@edfac.usyd.edu.au

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374830?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the last two decades there has been a lot of theorizing about multiculturalism & professional practice. Many practitioners are challenged by cultural diversity daily. Practicing from a culturally sensitive ethical perspective in a multicultural society is essential for good practice. Postmodem influences & critical questioning are seen to inform culturally sensitive ethical practice in their encouragement of practitioners' adoption of multiple belief systems & multiple perspectives & the need to pose questions challenging practice regarding awareness of cultural encapsulation & cultural sensitivity. The development of culturally sensitive ethical practice guidelines within the context of a multicultural society is proposed, firstly, by assessing the cultural sensitivity of the ethics codes & secondly, by balancing culture & ethical codes. References. Adapted from the source document.

Group Supervision for Social Work Students on Placement: An International Comparison

Author: McCafferty, Paul11 Partnership Care West, Derry Pmccafferty67@hotmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61386253?accountid=14925

Abstract: Partnership Care West is a voluntary organization that contracts with the Northern Ireland Social Care Council (NISCC) to provide ten placements for social work students. NISCC is a statutory organization, with responsibility for registering & regulating social care/work, improving standards in education & training & standardizing practice in Northern Ireland NISCC (2003). The students attend the practice learning centre & are then given placements in voluntary sector sites established by the centre. Traditionally, the students were supervised on a one to one basis using the long arm approach. In recent years however, the centre has developed a model for supervising these students in groups. Building on my positive experience of conducting group supervision & to further my knowledge, skills & values in this area, I recently undertook an international comparison with the School of Social Work in Haifa Israel. This School has an already well established model for supervising students in groups & I hoped that I could learn something to help me develop my model further. I would like to thank Nava Arkin at the University of Haifa for her willingness to take part in this comparison & for her encouragement throughout. This article aims to outline my findings of the comparison & outline the theoretical constructs that make international comparisons in social work possible. References. Adapted from the source document.

The Magnetism of Power in Helping Relationships. Professional Attitude and Asymmetry

Author: Schuyt, Theo N M11 Vrije U Amsterdam

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61376843?accountid=14925

Abstract: What makes helping relationships -- or social interventions in general -- so sensitive to abuse? These problems are directly related to the nature of the helping relationship. The core of this relationship is the inequality, the asymmetry, between the helper and the person being helped, and the dependence of the latter. Asymmetry is the driving force behind every social intervention and at the same time its weakest point. Handling asymmetry in an appropriate manner constitutes a major part of the work of the intervening party. This asymmetry makes heavy demands on the professional attitude of the intervening party i.e. the helper. Is s/he capable of dealing with dependence in an acceptable way? Is s/he well-versed in her/his profession? This article contains a comprehensive sketch of many of the possible dangers and pitfalls which beset asymmetric intervention relations. At the end it will be argued that, for a better understanding, the proximity of helping and power has to be taken into account. Adapted from the source document.

The Concept of Developmental-Tasks and Its Significance for Education and Social Work

Author: Uhlendorff, Uwe11 U Kassel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377266?accountid=14925

Abstract: The term "developmental-task" was introduced by Robert Havighurst in the 1950's. According to R. Harvighurst, the term refers to tasks which arise in a social context during an individual lifetime. Since the 1950's the concept of developmental-tasks has become an important theoretical approach in educational science and in theories of growth and development -- but not in social work and social pedagogy. In the following article I aim to show that this approach is very important to theory and practice of social pedagogy and social work. Adapted from the source document.

Welfare Lobby Groups Responding to Globalisation: A Comparison of the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) and the UK Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG)

Author: Mendes, Philip11 Dept Social Work, Faculty Medicine, Monash U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390363?accountid=14925

Abstract: The past decade has witnessed a period of intense economic globalisation. The growing significance of international trade, investment, production and financial flows appears to be curtailing the autonomy of individual nation states. In particular, globalisation appears to be encouraging, if not demanding, a decline in social spending and standards. However, many authors believe that this thesis ignores the continued impact of national political and ideological pressures and lobby groups on policy outcomes. In particular, it has been argued that national welfare consumer and provider groups remain influential defenders of the welfare state. For example, US aged care groups are considered to be particularly effective defenders of social security pensions. According to this argument, governments engaged in welfare retrenchment may experience considerable electoral backlash (Pierson 1996; Mishra 1999). Yet, it is also noted that governments can take action to reduce the impact of such groups by reducing their funding, and their access to policy-making and consultation processes. These actions are then justified on the basis of removing potential obstacles to economic competitiveness (Pierson 1994; Melville 1999). Adapted from the source document.

Youth and Health as an Issue of Research in Social Work -- Two Examples of Current Research

Author: Stumpp, Gabriele11 Instit Erziehungswissenschaft, U Tubingen

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61376933?accountid=14925

Abstract: Health issues under aspects pertaining to social work are currently being investigated in our department under two main perspectives. The study of Youth, Health, and Internet is based on experiences with a project of e-mail counseling for youths we have been running in our department for one year so far. Our thesis is that the internet has become an important platform for youngsters in general as well as concerning health issues specifically. So far, however, little is known about the ways youths address their health related problems in the net. We believe that research in this area is badly needed since future concepts of effective health improvement and prevention for youths cannot ignore this medium. Biography and Health is our second focus of investigation, addressing deficiencies in the empirical research of Aaron Antonovsky s salutogenetic concept that has lately become quite popular in many health discussions. Drawing from biographical methods we are currently investigating the development of the so called "sense of coherence" -- the center piece of salutogenesis. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Iarskala-Smirnova, Elena; Romanov, Pavel; Lovtsova, Natalia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377313?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the paper was to get an understanding about how the profession of social work explains its relevance and legitimacy in today's Russia, to enlighten the importance of socio-political, professional and educational contexts in explaining the societal position of the social work profession in Russia. This paper begins with the analysis of the processes of legitimization, professionalization and constitution of social work in today's Russia. In addition to functionalist and critical perspectives on these three processes, in its second part the paper employs phenomenological approach looking into everyday life theory of social work that is constructed in routine work at the social service agencies. The third part of this paper talks about the issues of social services and social work with family and children in contemporary Russia. Adapted from the source document.

Neoliberalism, the Third Way and Social Work: The UK Experience

Author: Ferguson, Iain11 U Stirling

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382287?accountid=14925

Abstract: For most of the past two decades, the notion that there is no alternative to the market as a basis for organising society has constituted a kind of global 'common sense', accepted not only by the neo-liberal Right but also by social democratic thinkers and politicians, in the form of 'the Third Way'. This paper will critically assess the central claims of neoliberalism in the light of experience in the UK and internationally, evaluate the ways in which Third Way policies are shaping social work in the UK, and in the final section, begin to explore some of the ways in which the anti-capitalist movement which has emerged in recent years might contribute to the development of a new, engaged social work, based on social justice. Adapted from the source document.

Different Levels of Policy Change: A Comparison between the Public Discussion on Social Security in Sweden and in Finland

Author: Kroll, Christian1; Blomberg, Helena1 Swedish School Social Science, Research Instit, U Helsinki christian.kroll@thelsinki.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377990?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article compares & contrasts historical social-insurance debates in Finland & Sweden. Major topics surveyed include the different levels of policymaking & their implications, the justifications for changes in welfare policy, & different levels of change in the social-insurance system. Data is presented that reflects different types of suggestions of policy changes in the Swedish & Finnish debates on social insurance in 1987, 1993, & 1997. Data is also presented that reflects the different types of justifications in the Finnish & Swedish debates on social insurance from 1987 to 1997. There is also a discussion of different actors' suggestions of retrenchment in social insurance in Finland & Sweden in the 1990s. These actors include socialist politicians, socialist newspapers, non-socialist politicians, non-socialist newspapers, experts of various types, & other advocates. Using the available data, the article concludes that significant shifts in structural realities are necessary before any public debate on social-insurance retrenchment can gain significant traction.

Modernising Social Work and the Ethics of Care

Author: Meagher, Gabrielle1; Parton, Nigel1 U Sydney

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398627?accountid=14925

Abstract: Recent attempts to 'modernise' social work have emphasised the importance of collaboration, partnership, and participation with individual users of services and the wider community. However, technical-rational aspects of managerialism have proved dominant. Managerialist approaches to social service administration and delivery threaten important dimensions of social work; specifically its caring and democratic-transformative dimensions. However, social work theorists have only recently begun to re-engage with ideas of care. We argue that closer attention to feminist debates about the ethics of care can make a significant contribution to not only rehabilitating the ideal of care for social work but also to moving forward the modernisation agenda itself. We develop a feminist critique of managerialism, and argue that the discourse of the ethics of care offers useful ways of framing arguments to counter some damaging impacts of managerial reforms. Adapted from the source document.

Changing Europe and the Relevance of Care and the Caring Professions

Author: Bruckner, Margrit11 Fachhochschule Frankfurt

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382334?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the paper is to introduce the challenges of the international care debate of the last ten years in order to grasp basic social needs, to analyse their treatment in the public and private sphere and to look at the orientation of professional answers by the care-professions. The concept of care enhances the societal dealing with -- or ignoring of -- different forms of dependency on informal and formal personal and social services throughout the life-cycle (child-care, nursing sick or handicapped persons, supporting the elderly) and in special life situations (from help to lone mothers and their children, via help to drug-addicts to help for homeless people). All societies have different approaches to deal with these life-situations, they do so by employing various mixtures of: familial support, mostly provided by women, social politics, organized by the state, & public and/or private social services. This welfare-mix shows different combinations of private and public obligations, paid and und unpaid work, professional and laymen's tasks based on a specific understanding of morality and justice embedded in the gender structure and intergenerational relationships. The importance of social work as a profession in this context differs according to the historical developments and cultural traditions. Characteristic for the profile of social work is the relevance of a care ethics and the existence of social rights, the tension of mothering and professional methods, the relationship between help, denial and punishment and the ways of institutionalisation. The actuality of this debate is closely intertwined with the restructuring of societal bonds in the face of globalisation, the political reorganisation of states, the changes in the living together of different generations and both sexes and the consequences for the organisation and contents of welfare. Looking at Germany and Eastern Europe two new phenomena of social relevance for the discussion of care work and care needs can be taken as an example: the extent of cheap illegal women laborers travelling between east and west, especially Polish women working intermittendly in private care for old people and the highly organized trafficking of women from Russia to Germany to work in the sex business. The care debate entails a reframing of welfare issues in the light of social justice between classes, ethnicities and gender groups. Adapted from the source document.

But even though they actually do have access from different places to the information and communication pool of the internet, there is evidence that the ways in which teenagers use the net -- regarding the scope and frequency in which services are used as well as the preferences for different contents of these services -- differ significantly in relation to socio-economic status, education, and gender. The results of the regarding empirical studies may be summarised as such: teenager with low (formal) education especially use internet services embracing 'entertainment, play and fun' while higher educated teenagers (also) prefer intellectually more demanding and particularly services supplying a greater variety of communicative and informative activities. More generally, pedagogical and sociological studies investigating "digital divide" in a differentiated and sophisticated way -- i.e. not only in terms of differences between those who do have access to the Internet and those who do not -- suggest that the internet is no space beyond 'social reality' (e.g. DiMaggio & Hargittai 2001, 2003; Vogelgesang, 2002; Welling, 2003). Different modes of utilisation, that structure the internet as a social space are primarily a specific contextualisation of the latter -- and thus, the opportunities and constraints in virtual world of the internet are not less than those in the 'real world' related to unequal distributions of material, social and cultural resources as well as social embeddings of the actors involved. This fact of inequality is also true regarding the outcomes of using the internet. Empirical and theoretical results concerning forms and processes of networking and community building -- i.e. sociability in the internet, as well as the social embeddings of the users which are mediated through the internet -- suggest that net based communication and information processes may entail the resource 'social support'. Thus, with reference to social work and the task of compensating the reproduction of social disadvantages -- whether they are medial or not -- the ways in which teenagers get access to and utilize net based social support are to be analysed.

Abstract: The research project on "Seniors in Society. Strategies to Retain Individual Autonomy" (2002-2004) is supported by the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic. It's importance is emphasized by the relevance of social and economic aspects of demographic ageing of the population and that of fundamental changes associated with the transformation of Czech society. The objectives of the research are (1) to find out seniors' material and social resources sup-porting their relative autonomy in everyday life, (2) to record their personal expectations from state, community, or formal and informal support and aid institutions, respectively, and (3) to uncover their engagement in social interaction and individual experiencing of the integration into social groups. The data acquired become the base for (4) identifying the typologies corresponding to the levels of seniors' social integration (i.e. groups of relatives, friends, neighbours, special-interest and professional groups). By applying qualitative methods, we explore (5) strategies of everyday life and coping with life cycle events and crisis within particular types. Special attention is paid to the family background of the seniors, including relatives in the vertical line. Specifically, we focus on (6) conditions under which family is capable and willing to help or actually is helping it's oldest members, as well as on their interpretation within (7) identified types of the relatives supportive systems.

Some Considerations on the Potential Contributions of Intercultural Social Work

Author: Fook, Jan11 Deakin U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390394?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work at global levels, and across international and intercultural divides, is probably more important now than ever before in our history. It may be that the very form our ideas about intercultural work take need to be re-examined in the light of recent global changes and uncertainties. In this short position paper I wish to offer some considerations about how we might approach the field of intercultural social work in order to gain new insights about how we practise at both local and global levels. For me, much of the promise of an intercultural social work (and for the purposes of this paper I see aspects of international social work in much the same light) lies in its focus on the way we categorise ourselves, our ideas and experiences in relation to others. The very notion of intercultural or international social work is based on assumptions about boundaries, differences, ways of differentiating and defining sets of experiences. Whether these are deemed "cultural" or "national" is of less importance. Once we are forced to examine these assumptions, about how and why we categorise ourselves in relation to other people in particular ways, the way is opened up for us to be much more critical about the bases of our own, often very deep-seated, thinking. This understanding, about how and why notions of 'difference' operate in the way they do, can potentially open our understanding to all the other ways, besides cultural or national labelling, in which we categorise and create differences between ourselves and others. Intercultural social work, taken as a potential site for understanding the creation of difference then, has the potential to help us critically examine the bases of much of our practice in any setting, since most practice involves some kind of categorisation of phenomena.

International Social Work Education at the Crossroads

Author: Dominelli, Lena11 IASSW

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395050?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work has been a player in the international arena since 1928 when the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) was founded alongside its sister organisations, the International Federation of Social Workers (IFSW) and the International Council for Social Welfare (ICSW). These divided their remit into education, practice and policy respectively. Their development has been an interesting one, but the details of it need not detain us here. I only want to lay aside the argument that having an interest in the international domain is a new phenomenon in social work. At the same time, I want to emphasise how impressive it is that a profession that has been so tied into modernity, linked to the modern nation-state (Lorenz, 1994) and rooted in local legislation and traditions has such a long-standing history of involvements that have crossed borders to promote understanding and knowledge-building. In these encounters, social work educators and practitioners have engaged with others who were different from them while struggling to make their interactions egalitarian and respectful ones. This aim has been thwarted by a range of factors that those acting in this domain had to address, namely, the contradictory position of the profession in negotiating its idealistic ambitions within the realities of the messy politics of practice as altruistic motives clashed with proselytising values and imperialistic adventures. For in the world of national aggrandisement embedded in the belief in the superiority of one particular people or 'race' and its culture excluding those outside its boundaries and 'doing good' to them were unquestioned assumptions that created great wrongs as languages, peoples and cultures disappeared under messianic and imperialistic rule. Consequently, some of social work's international initiatives have been successful in promoting egalitarian relations, others have not. In this paper, I will consider some of the issues that those promoting international social work today have to address if their efforts are not to become another means of propagating inegalitarian or neo-imperialist relations between educators and practitioners in high-income countries and those in low-income ones. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Education and Training in Europe and the Bologna Process

Author: Labonte-Roset, Christine11 EASSW

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61401192?accountid=14925

Abstract: A short review of the last three decades shows that social work programmes have developed similarly in (almost) all European countries, both in terms of structural and content-related characteristics. Here I would like to focus on the following aspects: (1) Increased academic focus of training, (2) Generalist programme, & (3) international/European orientation. Increased academic focus means that social work programmes have been established at universities or comparable higher education institutions, such as universities of applied sciences. The only exception is France where the approximately 150, generally fairly small colleges and the 14 larger instituts regionaux have a hybrid position between vocational colleges and universities and are roughly comparable to academies.

Choosing Social-Educational Professions in Post-Soviet Countries: International Comparison

Author: Urboniene, Aiste1; Leliugiene, Irena1 Instit Educational Studies, Kaunas U Technology

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61354744?accountid=14925

Abstract: The motivation functions as the most important and decisive factor in choosing the profession Therefore it has an especially remarkable role in the further professional activity of a social-educational worker to raise one's qualification and progress as a specialist. The issue of the professional motivation for choosing social-educational work-studies is becoming increasingly important in post-soviet countries, where the institution of social worker is new and the social exclusion is so widely expressed. The issue of the professional aptitude of students is also important in various professional fields, however in social-educational professions it's importance is exceptional. The profession of social-educational work is based on competences that are constantly expanding and becoming more and more complex. Adapted from the source document.

The Impact of Job Characteristics on Social and Human Service Workers

Author: Allen, Reva I1; Lamberg, Eric G; Pasupuleti, Sudershan; Cluse-Tolar, Terry; Ventura, Lois A1 c/o Cluse-Tolar -- Dept Social Work, Coll Heath & Human Services, U Toledo, OH

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355426?accountid=14925

Abstract: The work environment characteristics of job stress, job variety, job autonomy, & supervision are theorized to affect the job satisfaction & organizational commitment of social & human service workers. Most research to date has focused upon the impact of these variables on job satisfaction, with little attention being paid to organizational commitment. To determine the effects these characteristics have on both job satisfaction & organizational commitment, data from a survey of social & human service employees across Northwest Ohio were examined. In Ordinary Least Squares regression, all four job characteristics had a significant impact on job satisfaction, while only job variety & supervision had statistically significant effects on organizational commitment.

Abstract: Following the end of a half-century of Soviet occupation, Lithuania, like other former Soviet republics, has been in socio-economic disorder. Now that Lithuania is free, the system of social welfare is characterized by under-funded health services & pensions, & a large number of institutions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with students & practitioners focusing on community development, using Lofland's model of social setting analysis. Results indicate that the collaborative efforts successfully produced a revolutionary & successful social service program, a multi-generational living facility offering full-time social services to unwed mothers, infants, & elderly residents. This article is based upon the qualitative study of social work practitioners & social work students & chronicles the successes & difficulties encountered within the process of community development.

Access for All? The Promise and Problems of Universalism

Author: Clarke, John11 Faculty Social Sciences, Open U, Milton Keynes, UK john.clarke@open.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382198?accountid=14925

Abstract: In what follows, I explore why the question of 'access for all' is both important & difficult. Beginning by treating it as a contested claim, I will consider some of its political, institutional & professional implications. What do I mean by saying that access for all is a contested claim? First of all, it is a claim -- a demand that access for all needs to be created. It is a claim about change. To demand 'access for all' is to speak about, & speak against, social conditions that are unjust, unequal or excluding. At its simplest, then, to claim 'access for all' is to address social arrangements in which all people do not have access. Secondly, it is a claim made by -- or on behalf of -- specific social groups against their experience of exclusion, marginalization or subordination. I have added these other terms because I think that 'exclusion' is too simple, & too problematic, a term to capture all the aspects of unjust social arrangements that produce claims for 'access'. Access is a demand to be treated equitably in relation to a range of valued social resources, conditions & relationships. It is a claim to be a member: of the society, the polity or the nation. It is a claim to be a citizen: to possess rights & the capacity to make legitimate demands on the state. It is a claim on the apparatuses & agencies that sustain social citizenship: citizenship brings with it access to benefits, services & rights of 'fair dealing' or 'fair treatment'. As this last point suggests, it is a claim about equality: the expectation that all citizens will be dealt with by public agencies in ways that are not discriminatory or oppressive. References.

A Perfect 'Treatment-Society'?

Author: Jensen, Niels Rosendal11 Danish U Education, Copenhagen nrj@dpu.dk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373792?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Danish Minister of Social Affairs is a very eager protagonist of quality in treatment, almost searching for the "perfect" treatment for children, youngsters, disabled, etc. Many expensive research projects dealing with quality management as well as developmental projects have been launched during the latest years in order to improve professional practice. Within that context this article will deal with the relations between paternalism & ignorance & between pro-social behaviour & anti-social treatment in order to grasp "why professions are doing vicious things." The main focus is concerned with the knowledge field of social pedagogy. References. Adapted from the source document.

KIWAKKUKI -- Women Fight against HIV/AIDS. An Encouraging Example for Social Work in Tanzania

Author: Strauch, Iris; Eickhoff, Anne Beatrice

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397829?accountid=14925

Abstract: For 20 years, AIDS has continued its relentless spread across the globe. By the end of the year 2000, the United Nations' Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS reported that 36.1 million men, women, & children around the world were living with HIV & 21.8 million had died of it. Though AIDS is now found in every country, it has most seriously affected sub-Saharan Africa -- home to 70% of all adults & 80% of all children living with HIV, & the continent with the least medical resources in the world. Today, AIDS is the primary cause of death in Africa & it has had a devastating impact on villages, communities & families. In many African countries, the number of newly infected persons is increasing at a rate that is threatening to destroy the social fabric. Life expectancy is decreasing rapidly in many of these countries as a result of AIDS related illnesses & socioeconomic problems. Of the approximately 13.2 million children orphaned by HIV/AIDS worldwide, 12.1 million live in Africa. References. Adapted from the source document.

Structural Problems in the Development of Social Work in Central Europe under Transformation. The Case of Poland

Author: Szmagalski, Jerzy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397258?accountid=14925

Abstract: Socio-economic transformation the countries of Central Europe are undergoing since 1989 has brought new developments in social welfare systems of this region. Social work, which was in the countries of the region during their communist past either non-existent or a superficial activity, has come to be reated as an instrument of social welfare systems there. The collapse of authoritarian regimes in the region clearly induced political leaderships there to opt for transition to Western style civil society. Hence adoption of social work seemed to be natural choice for the countries in the region. Adapted from the source document.

Position, Professional Expertise and Functions of an Educator of Child Care Homes in Lithuania

Author: Rupsiene, Luidmila1; Leliugiene, Irina1 Dept Social Pedagogy, Klaipeda U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382154?accountid=14925

Abstract: Speaking about professionals working with children at child care homes in Lithuania, first of all we encounter a problem of terminology. This problem arises because in various countries & languages we call these professionals differently. In Lithuania we call them "aukletojai". We also use the word "aukletojas" when speaking about both professionals working directly with children at kindergartens, & parents, as all parents are educators of their children. We suppose, that the word 'aukletojas' corresponds to the German "erzieher", & "aukleti" to "erziehen". Every "aukletojas" in Lithuania clearly realizes that he is a pedagogue, because in this country every professional, involved in educational work with children -- an "aukletojas", a teacher, a social pedagogue & a special pedagogue -- is called a pedagogue. In this context it is essential to conceive that in Lithuania an "educator" & a "social pedagogue" are different pedagogical professions & that none of the "aukletojas" identify himself as a social pedagogue.

The Impact of Western Social Workers in Romania -- A Fine Line between Empowerment and Disempowerment

Author: Dumling, Bianca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355381?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores the impact of Western social workers in post-Communist Romania. The transition from a planned to a market economy meant ended full employment & significantly increased poverty & inequality. It is noted that Western involvement, which initially was mostly humanitarian, helped to alleviate human misery. However, as western social workers became more involved in training, community development, & prevention, their efforts often shifted from empowerment to disempowerment because of cultural differences. Emphasis is on the dilemma posed by the structure of international social work projects which are conditioned by Western grant guidelines that fail to consider root causes & inequalities that must be addressed before long-term, sustainable change can occur. The disempowerment experienced by Romanians working in international non-governmental organizations is described. It is concluded that empowerment can only take place if Western social workers recognize that their ideas are often incompatible with Romanian culture. Projects need to be re-designed with Romanians as the starting point rather than with concepts imported from the West. The implications for social work in other developing nations are discussed.

About Social Work and Anti-Modernity

Author: Alayon, Norberto11 U Buenos Aires

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395404?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article relies on the work of Gustavo Parra, as well as that of other social scientists, in order to argue that the character of social work in Argentina has always been conservative, often to the point of being anti-modern. The development of Argentine social work is traced from 1924 onward, with data presented from research conducted in 1934, 1977, 1992, & 1999. The data is complemented by contemporaneous observations. Argentine social work is found to be particular anti-modern in its attitudes toward public health & community well-being. Much of the blame is placed on the Roman Catholic Church, which held a good amount of political & social sway in Argentina throughout the twentieth century, & which used that power to impose a conservative & anti-modern imprint on social work & the social sciences in general.

Philosophy of Knowledge for Social Change

Author: Krishnaraj, Maithreyi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61434092?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article considers the essentials needed to link knowledge & social change. The author argues that a philosophy of knowledge that can promote social change has to have some normative goals. This knowledge has to be tempered by reason. Scientific inquiry, to the extent that it imposes the condition that its conclusions are backed by warrantable evidence, is a method that promotes reason. It does not claim that it can discover all of truth. The author stresses that knowledge has to be accessible to all so that individuals can make informed judgment. The more people participate in knowledge generation, the greater are the chances of progress in knowledge, a knowledge tempered by understanding. 11 References. Adapted from the source document.

Application of Qualitative Research Methodology for Developing Social Work Practice Models

Author: Mahtani, Rajshree P11 Unit Social Policy & Social Welfare Administration, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496326?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article highlights the need to develop practice models in the field of social work so as to contribute to the overall development of social work knowledge. It is based on the assumption that both qualitative & quantitative methodologies rest on separate epistemological positions, which result in different goals of social research, as well as in divergence with regard to the manner in which the two methodologies pursue social knowledge. The article also recognizes the significant role of qualitative research methodology in developing social work practice models based on empirical research & discusses the nature of research design decisions required of this methodology. The essential features of qualitative research methodology, resulting from its epistemology, are first presented, so as to subsequently reflect on the essentially emergent nature of qualitative research design decisions, & their application to the development of social work practice models. Prior to discussing the nature of qualitative research design decisions, this paper examines the essential features of qualitative research methodology & outlines the nature of its contribution to knowledge development. 54 References.

Abstract: This paper discusses the production & distribution of books & other media for social work, which is targeted at professionals, the public at large (including children), animators & fieldworkers, & the beneficiaries themselves.

It also suggests that academic institutions & nongovernmental organizations, who are publishing this material, require specific publishing skills & a much more professional approach if they are to be successful, or they might develop creative partnerships with professional publishing organizations. 2 Boxes.

Cross Cultural Social Work in the Asia Pacific Rim

Author: Mehta, Kalyani1; Vasoo, S1 Dept Social Work & Psychology, National U Singapore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61509768?accountid=14925

Abstract: An introduction to this special issue notes the relevancy of this topic in light of the increased attention being given to the changing geopolitical map since the terrorist attacks against the US on 11 September 2001. Many Asian nations have had to deal with the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the heels of an economic crisis. When added to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the North Korea nuclear issues, bombings in Bali, Jakarta, & Mumbai, & increased ethnic/religious conflicts, it becomes obvious that the need for crosscultural understanding has never been greater. Differences between social work & counseling are discussed, along with the impact of cultural factors on clients, & the need to make cultural understanding an integral part of policies, services, & legal provisions. Social workers are described as "ambassadors of crosscultural understanding" & suggestions are made for ways that they can enhance such understanding. Readers are asked to submit articles that describe innovative projects. J. Lindroth

Collaborative Practice across Borders: Experiences of Australian Social Work Practice in East Timor, 2000-1

Author: Rowlands, Alison11 Dept Social Work & Psychology, National U Singapore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61533253?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes aspects of social work intervention by Australian practitioners in Timor Loro Sa'e (East Timor) in 2000/01. It draws on the author's experience there & describes the role of an Australian government-funded community mental health service. East Timor is the world's newest nation & is in the process of rebuilding itself across all dimensions -- physical, economic, political, social, environmental, & personal. The author reflects on the contribution of social work to this development process & poses questions that challenged colleagues working in the agency.

Drawing Lessons from Local Designated Helpers to Develop Culturally Appropriate Social Work Practice

Author: Kee, Ling How11 Faculty Social Sciences, U Malaysia, Sarawak

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61538442?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper describes a study that explored the underlying cultural themes of the helping approaches of a group of local designated helpers in Sarawak, Malaysia. In drawing lessons for developing culturally appropriate practice, an important finding is the mutuality of worldviews between the cultural themes of the helpers & the help seekers. Insights can also be drawn from the creative synthesis of the "old" & the "new.". 2 Tables, 1 Appendix, 24 References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Service Needs Assessment in Global Work Environments: A Comparative Study between American Expatriates in South Korea and Korean Expatriates in the United States

Author: Choi, Soochan11 School Social Welfare, Yonsei U, South Korea

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61533289?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined social service needs of American expatriates in South Korea & Korean expatriates in the US on the basis of problems they experienced in the host country & services they would like to see developed. The findings suggested that the respondents were mainly concerned about language barriers, elderly parents back home, & children's schooling. Correspondingly, they desired social services such as language training, services for elderly parents, & school counseling for children. The results call for practical social work interventions for global workers. 3 Tables, 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Traditional Confucian Concepts of Mental Health: Its Implications to Social Work Practice with Chinese Communities

Author: Yip, Kam-shing11 Dept Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61500438?accountid=14925

Abstract: The traditional Confucian concept of mental health has a strong impact on the mental health of Chinese people. It stresses submissiveness of individuals to achieve harmony of the collective. Harmony is defined by the social order & authority figures in various social systems. It encourages people to restrain their emotions, avoid interpersonal conflicts, & suppress individual rights so as to maintain a good harmony with others. Social workers should be aware of this cultural difference when working with the Chinese communities. They should recognize the dilemmas in empowerment vs tolerance, changing of social environment vs suppressive collective harmony, cognition & emotional change vs rigid moralization, self-actualization vs self-sacrifice, emotional ventilation vs emotional restraint, self-determination vs self-definition by others, & mutual support vs egocentric preservation. 1 Figure, 71 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61557872?accountid=14925

Abstract: Community-based intervention with young offenders has been highly favored in recent decades. This paper presents a recent qualitative study on the effectiveness of such a service project in Hong Kong. This project has employed the social bond theory of Travis Hirschi (1969) as its conceptual framework. The findings of the study confirm the effectiveness of using a community-based approach to work with young offenders & support its employment; some service implications are discussed. 9 Tables, 1 Figure, 2 Appendixes, 35 References.

Interactions between Field Workers and Their Clients and Superiors in Non-Governmental Organisations

Author: Ahmad, Mokbul Morshed11 Dept Geography & Environment, Dhaka U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61554137?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article deals with the interaction between the field workers & their clients & between field workers & their immediate superiors. This discussion is important for three main reasons. First, it is important to know how field workers interact with their clients & their immediate superiors. Second, from a 'development' point of view, it is important to see how policies & decisions are filtered down from the top to the field workers & how field workers pass them on to their clients. Third, it is very important for the NGO management to know how or whether the problems or opinions of the clients are taken into consideration in the short- or long-term planning of the NGOs. 3 Tables, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Srivastava, Vineeta11 Udaipur School Social Work

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61494888?accountid=14925

Abstract: By analyzing the problems of the aged & the causes thereof, & identifying the factors contributing to satisfaction or dissatisfaction in old age, professional social workers can offer immense help to the aged in contemporary Indian society. Enabling the aged in reality perception & adjustment by providing the required information (role of an enabler); bringing about necessary changes in the attitude & behavior patterns through required guidance & counseling (role as a guide); getting the desired changes in public policy & social legislation introduced (role of an advocate & change agent); contacting different departments/organizations/agencies providing services for the aged & acting as a link between them & the aged (role of a liaison person); ensuring availability of different types of services in an integrated manner (role of a coordinator); mobilizing community resources to meet out the needs of the aged (role of a community organizer); protesting & lobbying against the unjust practices of various government & nongovernment organizations -- for example, not properly utilizing the funds meant for the aged, corruption or carelessness in disbursing the old age pension, employing nonprofessionals where social workers need to be employed -- (role of a social activist); & similar strategies may be adopted by the social workers to resolve the problems faced by the aged. This article is an attempt to analyze how far the social work profession has been successful in fulfilling its responsibilities towards the aged. The article begins by throwing some light on the international & national efforts to tackle the challenges of 'ageing populations.'. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 29 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61537368?accountid=14925

Abstract: Community participation means mobilization of the entire community for its own development. People should be aware of their problems & contribute in finding ideal solutions. Project initiators must utilize the community to the optimum level by considering its potential. They should encourage the community to come up with answers by actual participation instead of seeking only their acceptance. Common cause & common good should be the guiding principles for the success of community participation in development. 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

Care or Control: The Struggles of Probation Officers in Working with Young Probationers Who Abused Psychotropic Drugs in Hong Kong

Author: Sim, Timothy11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61499057?accountid=14925

Abstract: Psychotropic drug abuse among young persons below 21 years old has been increasing at an alarming rate in Hong Kong recently. Probation officers when working with young probationers who abuse psychotropic drugs need to contend not only with a complex phenomenon, but be challenged by the dilemmas of the nature of their profession between care & control. This article, by drawing from a discussion with a group of probation officers & feedback from a group of young probationers, raises some issues & questions for probation service in Hong Kong pertaining to working with young probationers who abuse psychotropic drugs. Some suggestions are made for probation officers to achieve more effective planning & interventions in working with young probationers who abuse psychotropic drugs. 34 References.

Abstract: The chimeras of hope are fraught with delusions. In a postideological world, theories & constructs that shaped social realities in the past have undergone a metamorphosis of intent & content. The treacherous 9-11 (2001) debris, unfortunately, seems to herald the end of a civil society. However, social work education can truly universalize basic constructs of a society that transcends national boundaries toward world citizenship. 38 References. Adapted from the source document.

Paradigm Shift: Social Welfare and Social Work in the New Society

Author: Fung, Ho-lup

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61534935?accountid=14925

Abstract: Under the new society of globalization, marketization, & programization, there was a paradigm shift in social welfare & social work. The two meanings of social welfare -- the state of well-being & the political relationship between the state & its people -- were being reconstructed. Productivity began to replace the sense of well-being, & "tough love" also replaced kindness. Professional autonomy & the close relationship of "worker-client" of social work were also deconstructed. What should social work, as a force of gradual social reform, do to this paradigm shift? 34 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Critical Review of Social Work Practice with Post-Divorce Families in Hong Kong

Author: Lau, Yuk-king11 Dept Social Work, Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin, NT yklau@cuhk.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61499142?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Hong Kong, post-divorce families have long been conceptualized as "single-parent families," thereby overlooking the fact that some nonresident parents do have continuous participation in the postdivorce families. With this overgeneralized conceptualization, social services have been focusing on bringing about successful single parenting & have ignored the possibility of postdivorce co-parenting & nonresidential parenting in these families. It also reinforces the win-lose dichotomy in fighting over child custody. The author recommends reconceptualizing the post-divorce families as "binuclear families" to draw our attention to the possible participation & influence of the nonresident parents in these families. Promotion of forever-parenthood & family law reform would also help to induce change in the dominant social discourse. We need more empirical research on postdivorce families to clear the obscured picture & facilitate the formulation of an inclusive practice model with these families. Last but not least, as co-constructors of the social discourse on families in alternate forms such as postdivorce families, social work practitioners should enhance their reflexivity on family ideologies & beliefs in parent-child relationships. 28 References.

Prevalence, Role and Functions of Self-Help Groups in Hong Kong

Author: Mok, Bong-ho1; Chau, Kin-lam; Fung, Ho-lup; Ngai, Ngan-pun1 Dept Social Work, Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin, NT

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61499082?accountid=14925

Abstract: Draws on 1999/00 structured self-administered questionnaire data from 100 self-help groups (total N = 719 members) in Hong Kong to explore the prevalence & characteristics of self-help groups, their role & functions, their life cycle, & their relationship to the social work profession. Some 211 self-help groups with 32,657 members were identified. The five most common objectives are to promote a spirit of self-help & mutual help, exchange information & knowledge, develop problem-solving ability & share experience, provide care & emotional support, & develop support networks. The five most common activities are recreational activities, group discussion & sharing, seminars, social service organization visits, & volunteerism. Effecting community or social policy change does not appear to be a concern. The extent to which members sensed individual change in feelings, thought, and behavior is examined, identifying three mechanisms for change: (1) social learning opportunities; (2) receiving & accepting the reality of having disabilities; & (3) social network expansion. Benefits of belonging to a group are noted, & member sense of collective empowerment is described. 6 Figures, 9 References. J. Zendejas

Abstract: Although studies have been carried out to examine factors associated with the psychosocial adjustment of adolescents with economic disadvantage, there are several limitations of the existing literature. (1) Available studies have been mainly conducted in Western contexts & scientific studies based on Chinese people are almost nonexistent. (2) A review of the literature shows that existing studies are mainly cross-sectional in nature & few longitudinal attempts have been carried out to understand the development of poor adolescents across time. (3) There are few existing studies in which a wide range of adolescent developmental outcomes is included. Finally, there have been to date few related studies in which both parents & adolescents are included in a single study. Against this background, this study attempts to examine the relationships between a number of factors at different ecological systems & psychosocial adjustment of poor Chinese adolescents over time. 4 References.

Abstract: Each year, the US Dept of Health & Human Services, Administration for Children & Families, Children's Bureau spends approximately $110 million on discretionary activities to fund a variety of research & demonstration grants, training & technical assistance cooperative agreements, & multiyear research contracts with the purpose of building the knowledge base for child abuse & neglect & child welfare services. As part of this effort, the Children's Bureau manages more than 200 grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, & interagency agreements, with most individual awards ranging from $100,000 to several million dollars per year. Each project is testing a specific research question or service model, covering a wide range of topics related to child maltreatment, child protective services, child welfare, adoption, & child abuse & neglect prevention, treatment, & intervention (US Dept of Health & Human Services, 2003). This article presents a more in-depth discussion on the Quality Improvement Center projects. 5 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The Children's Bureau established Quality Improvement Centers to fund regional research projects to improve child welfare practices. The Southern Regional Quality Improvement Centers conducted a multifaceted needs assessment to identify casework supervision as the focus area for four learning laboratories. These projects are researching the effectiveness of clinical supervision in reducing preventable turnover & enhancing worker practice & client outcomes. Public/university/community partnerships conduct the planning, implementation, & evaluation of the each site's professional development intervention. This article will describe the model used to promote the development of learning laboratories, & the design for inter-project collaboration & cross-site evaluation. 2 Figures, 103 References.

Meeting Transformational Challenges: Continuing Education Leadership

Author: Kelly, Michael J1; Lauderdale, Michael L1 School Social Work, U Missouri, Columbia

Abstract: Organizations & leadership are faced with challenges different for any of those of the 20th century. Changes in the fundamental relationships between all formal organizations & their environments are most pronounced in well-developed countries. The first year of the 21st century appears to have signaled the end of a two-decade-long economic boom & ushered in shrinkage of federal, state, local, & nonprofit spending. Organizations have adjusted by reducing the workforce or discontinuing programs. Important alternatives exist, but they require creating new structures that can transform existing organizations to re-couple with the environment in way that can cope with these new circumstances. Professional continuing education has an important role to play in creating transformational organizations through developing the tools & training the leaders. The authors' experience with the survey of organizational excellence (SOE) & related tools may provide an example of how this can be done. 21 References. Adapted from the source document.

Improving Clinical Supervisory Practice in Front Line CPS Supervisors: A Mentoring Model

Author: Griffin, Carol1; Shiell, Debbie1 MidSOUTH, U Arkansas, Little Rock cmgriffin@midsouth.ualr.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61558087?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Arkansas Division of Children & Family Services & IV-E training partners are implementing a model of supervision. This model will incorporate the interactional & educational components described by Shulman (1993) & Munson (1995) where supervision reflects the parallel process between worker-supervisor & worker-client relationship, along with the support element provide through a mentor. Specific techniques will be implemented, with the goal of improving the supervisor's knowledge & ability to enhance the supervisees' assessment skills. Workers will benefit from regular, structured, supportive contact with the supervisor that will improve the relationship between the worker & the supervisor. In theory, the enhanced relationship will result in greater job satisfaction & a decrease in worker turnover. 14 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Role Demonstration Model of Supervision

Author: Sundet, Paul A1; Mermelstein, Joanne; Watt, J Wilson1 School Social Work, U Missouri sundetp@missouri.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61511006?accountid=14925

Abstract: Concern for the quality & effectiveness of child welfare supervision in MO has been a joint concern of the state agency & the U of Missouri-Columbia School of Social Work for some time. Twenty years ago these organizations collaborated on an intensive training project in this arena, the remnants of which are still impacting the system. Attempts to revive that initiative have since been hampered by the paucity of funds. However, when the Children's Bureau funded opportunity through the Quality Improvement Center at the U of Kentucky presented itself, both the administration of the Missouri Dept of Social Services & the School of Social Work saw a long-sought-for resource to draw on to address one of the most pressing workforce needs in this state. The challenges of developing a coherent model of supervision, imparting it to staff & rigorously evaluating its impact are considerable, but ones that the partners have eagerly accepted. The following paper details the model chosen, its rationale, & strategies chosen for implementation. 34 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Child welfare agencies around the country face a number of challenges recruiting & retaining caseworkers. Frontline supervision has been highlighted in the literature as a major contributor to worker satisfaction & retention of caseworkers in private & public child welfare agencies, particularly among child protective services caseworkers. The purpose of this article is to present an effective training model that addresses supervision issues with frontline child protective services supervisors. Furthermore, this model will seek to strengthen & expand a coordinated approach to casework supervision of frontline child protective services supervisors. 15 References.

The Vedic Theory of Clinical Social Work

Author: Wolf, David B11 Social Work Services Program, Dept Health, FL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61494948?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using Fischer's model for the analysis & comparison of clinical theories of induced change, a theory of clinical social work based on Vedic principles & practices is presented & analyzed here. Vedic theory is consistent with social work values, & the theory provides, especially with regards to the three gunas as foundational psychological constructs, a strong basis for empirical verification. Additional research on the components of the Vedic model is encouraged, & application of Vedic philosophy & principles to social work environments is suggested as being useful & valid for social workers who are comfortable with the tenets of this model. 40 References.

Author: Rao, Vidya11 Dept Social Welfare Administration, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61494917?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social welfare, an all-encompassing concept, includes identity issues; opportunities for self-determination; well-being of the poor, vulnerable, & weak; a life with dignity & security; & not being coerced. This article traces the emergence of the party system in Tamil Nadu, a state in India, & highlights the fact that social welfare gets defined differently according to the political situation. It enumerates who raises which issues, how, & why. The article also points out that social welfare is inextricably intertwined with the political process, & that, ensuring social welfare is a political process. 2 Tables, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

Living Conditions of Women Workers in Brick Kilns: Reflecting the Agenda for Social Work Intervention

Author: Mor, Singh11 Dept Social Work, Punjabi U, Patiala

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61507121?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present article looks into some of the aspects relating to housing, health, safety, education, & welfare facilities of women workers of the brick kilns industry. In spite of the pivotal role of this industry in the activities relating to the infrastructural development in the country, the living conditions of the workers in this industry are far from satisfactory. These women are unprotected & suffer from economic exploitation due to ignorance & illiteracy. They do arduous work for long hours, generally in unhygienic conditions effecting their health. Protective legislation in the critical areas of wages, maternity benefit, childcare, & social security have not benefited a great majority of them. The present article is based on a study done by the author on 54 brick kilns selected randomly out of a total of 547 units located in the five districts of the Hissar division of Haryana. 4 Tables, 3 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Kukanur, Huligeva1; Saroja, K1 Dept Human Development, Rural Home Science Coll, U Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61553066?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study was conducted during 1998-1999, where the sample comprising 52 Scheduled Caste (SC) & Scheduled Tribe (ST) & 48 non-SC & non-ST school dropouts & one of their parents or guardians. An interview schedule & personal observations were the major tools used for data collection. Results revealed that majority of the SC & ST school dropouts belonged to large-sized nuclear families with no landholding. They were found to have parents with little or no education, & who were engaged in agricultural labor work & caste occupation as compared to non-SC & non-ST dropouts. The SC & ST sample dropped out from school at a younger age than the non-SC & non-ST sample, because they were needed to work at home or to take care of younger siblings & graze the animals. A higher percentage of the SC & ST school drop-outs were found to be working as child laborers than the non-SC & non-STs. 9 Tables, 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Hegemeony of Eurocentrism in Social Work Practice: From Race to Culture as Ecological Perspective vis-a-vis Southeast Asian Populations

Author: Hall, Ronald E11 Coll Human Medicine, Michigan State Coll, East Lansing

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433983?accountid=14925

Abstract: Emergence of Southeast Asian populations in Western societies corresponds to Eurocentrism in social work practice. As per practice, race is assumed the universal, governing category of the social work clientele. It is on the basis of this hegemonic conceptual view that the construct of race is challenged by the emergence of alternative human population phenomena. For those who will engage in practice specific to the Southeast Asian populations, race must be reduced in proportion to its significance in their lives. The utilization of nonracial constructs includes the need for practitioners to acknowledge the ecological perspective & other culture specific belief systems. The outcome will contribute to the evolution of human well-being despite the prevalence of race constructs as hegemony vis-a-vis Southeast Asian populations. 30 References.

Changing Social Institutions and Their Impact on the Quality of Life

Author: Hebbar, Ritambhara11 Unit Rural Studies, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61507090?accountid=14925

Abstract: A report on the 2003 seminar, "Changing Social Institutions & their Impact on the Quality of Life," sponsored by the Indian Assoc of Social Science Institutions, presents an overview of the discussions related to the 11 paper presentations. Much attention was given to issues that helped place an understanding of social institutions in perspective, such as India's mixed economy that accommodates both the private & public sector in its vision of economic development; the failure of land reforms; the social/political dynamics of resistance & ethnic movements; & the impact of globalization/liberalization on economic, political, & social agendas. Other themes included decentralization, especially in regard to rural institutions, the importance of both formal & informal institutions, & the lack of financial autonomy for local bodies. The significant step toward democratic decentralization made by the 73rd Amendment Act 1992 is pointed out, noting that it grants decision-making powers to the village assembly. The discussions illustrated that administrative measures alone cannot ensure just & responsible governance, & effective institution building requires human resolve & endurance. J. Lindroth

Workplace Mobbing: A New Frontier for the Social Work Profession

Author: Reichert, Elisabeth11 School Social Work, Southern Illinois U, Carbondale ereich1234@cs.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61517777?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the US, abusive work environments perpetrated by a group against a target individual are well documented. Some European countries refer to this group action at the workplace as "mobbing." Mobbing can occur in any work environment & often leads to adverse emotional & other effects on both the individual & society as a whole. Because social workers are involved in workplace issues, they should be familiar with mobbing. However, the social work literature in the US does not address this issue. This article defines mobbing, examines characteristics & effects of mobbing, & explains why mobbing is a human rights violation. 41 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61506097?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper suggests that there are a number of action tasks that social workers should engage in to prepare for the delivery of professional development seminars in foreign language countries. The action tasks include selecting a translator, adjusting one's presentation to the limitations of translation, preparing with the translator, keeping the audience's attention, & finally, the importance of building a relationship with the translator. 1 Reference.

Interdisciplinary Teamwork in Community Children's Mental Health: An Innovative Field Model

Author: Reed-Ashcraft, Kellie1; Waring, Douglas A; Kittle, Cynthia Blanchard; Turner, John1 Social Work Program, Appalachian State U, Boone, NC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61481690?accountid=14925

Abstract: The need for staff trained in interdisciplinary settings is increasing in human services. Unfortunately, little distinction is made between teams that are multidisciplinary & teams that are interdisciplinary. This article describes an interdisciplinary internship effort in which social work & other students had opportunities to participate with various community multi- & interdisciplinary groups working with children with serious emotional disturbances & their families. The authors also describe the educational focus on delineating multi- vs interdisciplinary groups, & they present evaluation findings of these efforts. Finally, suggestions are provided for improving interdisciplinary educational opportunities in future community-based children's mental health initiatives. 2 Tables, 18 References.

A Survey of County Public Child Welfare Agencies: Implications for Distance Learning

Author: Petracchi, Helen E11 School Social Work, U Pittsburgh, PA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61543984?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on the potential utilization of multimedia in the distance education of public child welfare workers is extremely limited. This paper describes a survey of the presence of available information technology in PA's 67 public child welfare agencies, with special attention paid to administrative attitudes & the impact of this technology on distance education opportunities for the social workers in these agencies. With an 87% response rate, survey results suggest the technical capacity for onsite distance education of PA's public child welfare workers exists, in an environment in which there is also administrative support for this approach to training delivery. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 6 References.

Tilting the Balance: The Case of Family Counselling Centres

Author: Majmudar, Sumant11 Dept Social Work, Gujarat Vidyapith, Ahmedabad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61514413?accountid=14925

Abstract: The paper is an attempt to look at the newly developing service, the family counseling centers. They function in an enveloping ethos of severe problems in expressing oneself. It is observed in Gujarat that what is allowed is controlled expression under the constraints of 'family prestige' & 'compromise.' Skills development, hence, has to be oriented to the question: who is the client -- the woman or the family? The counselor's working alliance that also has to resolve the question of differing power potentials between the counselor & the woman client, then, is fraught with technical problems that highlight the need for continued training. Feminist social work has, of necessity, to be Indian culture specific & deal with the differing power potentials for egalitarian work to be a possibility. A change in the nomenclature to 'Family Crisis Centre,' in the above context, would open up channels of communication. 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

In this article, the author has outlined the purpose & goals for counseling families with mentally ill members. The skills required by a family counselor for such purpose are also given. The author has recommended a four-phased approach to counsel & empower families with mentally ill individuals. 1 Figure, 11 References. Adapted from the source document.

Marital Counselling within the Context of Differing Value Systems

Author: Joseph, Helen11 Coll Social Work, Nirmala Niketan, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61454715?accountid=14925

Abstract: Remarks on counselor cultural bias in marriage counseling, providing a case study from personal professional experience to illustrate. At issue is how the author navigated between her cultural value system & that of her clients in helping resolve their conflict. While the results are mixed, the experience offers some insight on how to counsel a couple when the counselor & clients have differing expectations/values on what the marriage relationship ought to be. This is discussed in terms of the counselor's role & attitudes & the preservation of each client's ego defenses. 2 References. J. Zendejas

Integrated Team Model for Children and Youth Services: Yes or No?

Author: Lee, Francis W.-L.11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61558638?accountid=14925

Abstract: From ten Integrated Teams (ITs) established in late 1994 for the provision of children & youth services, with some eight years of development, in 2001 there were more than 60 ITs in the territory. At the end of June 2003, there were 130 ITs (or Integrated Children & Youth Service Centres -- ICYSCs) in the territory. It seems that employing an "Integrated Team Model" of the provision of children & youth services has gained the faith & confidence from the authority. However, the strengths & limitations encountered by youth workers in ITs have not been systematically explored. The present study, a questionnaire survey with all IT workers as targets, has mainly explored the workers' opinions on the effectiveness & feasibility of implementing ITs, the difficulties/limitations they have encountered & the suggested ways for improvement. Based on the findings, recommendations are made so that further development of the IT model for children & youth services could be more promising. 6 Tables, 12 References.

McSocial Work -- Professional Decadence in the United States

Author: Epstein, William M11 School Social Work, U Nevada, Las Vegas wepstein@ccmail.nevada.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61434263?accountid=14925

Abstract: Professional social work in the US is too often envied & too little understood. Its many failures of organization, scholarship, & purpose should encourage other nations to look to their own experiences in developing professions of helping. The process of professionalizing social services in the US has been impeded by widespread hostility to poorer & lower-status citizens. Yet social work itself is complicit with these attitudes, making free institutional choices that benefit the practitioner at the expense of the service recipient; by failing to develop a credible scholarship of service outcomes; by ignoring objective credentials in deference to implicit "experience"; by protecting mediocrity at the expense of quality; & by promoting psychological & individual explanations over structural explanations of social failure. Mortality may be the most hopeful vehicle of reform. 49 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study aims to understand Chinese breast cancer patients' emotions & the emotional support they receive from self-help groups. The findings showed various responses, such as fear & depression of the uncertainty of death; helplessness toward the eventual parting with spouse; feeling of guilt resulting from inability to meet traditional female role expectations; & others. The emotional support that the patients received in the self-help groups through sharing & discussion showed a positive turn. 38 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Study of Marginal Youth's Likelihood and Delinquency in Hong Kong

Author: Ngai, Ngan-Pun1; Cheung, Chau-Kiu1 Dept Social Work, Chinese U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61518787?accountid=14925

Abstract: A study of marginal youth living in Hong Kong examines delinquency theories; assesses the impact of social services, police, school, family, religion, & prevention work on delinquency; & forecasts delinquent involvement. Marginal youths are described as those who exhibit antisocial behavior or have committed criminal acts. Information was obtained from interviews conducted in 1999 with 229 Chinese residents of Hong Kong, aged 12-23, who were recruited by social work teams. Social control, social learning, strain, & cognitive development theories are considered in relation to the effect of experiences, perceptions, beliefs, & values on delinquent acts. The results of general linear modeling, regression analysis, & latent trait modeling show that social control, especially moral belief, significantly predicted a low likelihood of offenses. Social learning showed no significant effect on the likelihood of offense but cognitive development & strain, especially frustration, tended to significantly impact the decrease of the likelihood of offenses. Probation experience & counseling tended to decrease delinquent involvement & the use of psychotropic substances respectively; however, prior punishment by the police predicted greater delinquency involvement. The implications for intervention are discussed. 1 Table, 18 References. J. Lindroth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61502775?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article sets out to look at the current interest in online learning & the uses it can have for students & practice teachers involved in professional social work training courses. It explores the difficulties that many people have in using online learning & also the advantages of taking part in this process. The author has studied the process of using online learning as a valuable teaching tool whilst the students are out on placement, & is keen to look at ways in which this would be a positive advantage to all involved in the training & development of social work students. Looking at a former model of the 'training team' the use of online learning is explored to see if this would enable a virtual training team to be established. The article is designed to stimulate thought about the use of online learning as a means of all the people involved in training keeping in touch. 4 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Leiba, Tony1; Leonard, Kate1 Harold Wood Education Centre, Faculty Health, South Bank U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61547786?accountid=14925

Abstract: Effective collaboration & interprofessional working between health & social care professions is increasingly recognized as necessary for the delivery of quality services. Although interprofessional education has long been advocated as a means to develop collaborative working, single professional courses remain the prevailing model of training. It is important that interprofessional education is taken forward for the benefit of professionals, users, & carers. This paper describes a Joint Practice Teacher course for health & social care practitioners. There is an overview of the drivers for interprofessional education & training emanating form the Department of Health & the health & social care professional bodies. Finally the practice teacher course & its structure, teaching, & learning activities & the reflections of students & teachers will be presented & discussed. 18 References.

Recent Trends in Multicultural Practice: Implications for Practice Teaching and Field Education

Author: Kaufman, Mark1; Love, Donna1 Dept Social Work, Washburn U, Topeka, KS mark.kaufman@washburn.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61513468?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents a three-part model for teaching students in the social service professions to become culturally competent practitioners from an Anglo-American perspective. It also discusses the importance of a multicultural perspective. The first part of the model emphasizes the importance of practitioner awareness of his or her own cultural values & biases. The second dimension of the model recognizes that a culturally competent practitioner seeks to understand the worldview & culture of the client, possesses some specific knowledge of diverse client groups & develops a basic understanding of sociopolitical influences. The final part of the model deals with the specific strategies, skills, & intervention techniques necessary to serve culturally diverse clients. 35 References. Adapted from the source document.

Teacher or Supporter? The Social Work Tutor's Role in Students' Professional Development

Author: Degenhardt, Dorothy11 Dept Social Work, U Dundee d.c.degenhardt@dundee.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61479814?accountid=14925

Abstract: At a time of an ongoing review of social work education & training in Scotland it seems important to examine the role of the social work tutor in working with students & how their intervention is experienced as educative &/or supportive. Previous research has shown that tutorials, both group & individual, have scored low in students' perception of effectiveness in preparation for practice, as one of a range of teaching methods (Triseliotis & Marsh, 1996). A definition of the tutor's role will be considered from the author's experience across three social work programs in Scotland. Consideration is given to the interface between the tutor's role & practice teacher's role in helping students with issues on placement. The paper will argue that the tutor's role should be enhanced & clarified & could be pivotal in promoting students' professional development within the new social work programs proposed in Scotland. 25 References.

Abstract: In 2003, a new professional qualification for social work will be introduced. This paper explores some of the changes that will follow as part of the new qualification in England (as practice is now different across the countries of the UK), using the hypothetical vantage point of looking back, somewhat light-heartedly, at the new qualification from the year 2010. 6 References.

An Assessment of Multicultural Competence in Supervision: Implications for Continuing Education

Author: Smith, Sharon Hines11 School Social Work, Rutgers State U, Camden, NJ sash@camden.rutgers.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61539658?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study discusses findings from the administration of a self-assessment checklist of multicultural competencies in supervision to a group of 37 supervisors. The supervisors were from social-health agencies in NJ providing services to persons 65 years of age & older. Findings indicate that participants perceived themselves as competent in domains of cross-cultural knowledge, attitudes, & relationship building capacities but less competent in the application of cross-cultural skills. The implications of these findings for understanding distinctive multicultural interpersonal dynamics in supervision, conceptualizing cultural competence across multiple domains, & developing cross-cultural social work continuing education & training programs are also discussed. 1 Table, 40 References.

The Emerging Field of Crime Victim Assistance: Are Social Workers Ready?

Author: Danis, Fran S11 School Social Work, U Missouri, Columbia danisf@missouri.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61511044?accountid=14925

Abstract: Assistance to victims of violent crimes is an emerging field of practice undergoing growth & expansion. Given a fit between social work generalist competencies & competencies needed for victim assistance, how well prepared are social workers for working with crime victims? A statewide survey of professional social workers was conducted to assess their academic preparation & their self-identified training needs. Despite a lack of specific course work, social workers have a great deal of experience in working with victims of violence. Survey respondents were also interested in a variety of topics focusing on direct practice with crime victims. 2 Tables, 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Importance of Including Supervisors When Evaluating Child Welfare Workers' Training

Author: Mason, Susan E1; LaPorte, Heidi Heft; Frankel, Arthur1 Wurzweiler School Social Work, Yeshiva U, New York, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61549533?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child welfare professional workers & their supervisors responded to surveys on training effectiveness three months after a series of staff development seminars. Participants in the seminars, which took place in the New York Metropolitan area, 1998-1999, volunteered the names of their agency supervisors & agreed that both they & their supervisors would be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire on how attendees' professional behavior may have changed related to the staff development training. A total of 285 trainees & 115 supervisors returned mailed surveys with response rates of 82% & 47%, respectively. Training participants were more likely than their supervisors to think that co-workers & supervisors noticed changes in their work. Both groups thought that the training benefited clients but there was no formalized way of documenting this finding. Professional workers & their supervisors favored additional training even when perceptions of efficacy differed. This article demonstrates that in child welfare settings, workers & their supervisors may hold disparate perceptions about the specific benefits of staff development but are positive about its value in general. The authors suggest that good communication between professional workers & supervisors coupled with articulated & measurable agency goals would go a long way to enhance the long-term effectiveness of staff development. 3 Tables, 27 References.

Protective Services Caseworkers' Understanding of the DSM: Improving Risk Assessment through Professional Development Training

Author: Davidson, Jennifer C1; Levine, Joanne1 c/o Levine -- School Social Work, Wichita State U, KS

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61558130?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child & adult protective services caseworkers must be capable of understanding relevant information for risk assessment & care plans found in mental health evaluations that are formulated from information provided in the Diagnostic & Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). The literature suggests that many caseworkers are not trained to understand mental health assessments & the DSM-IVTR. Therefore, the vulnerable clients that these caseworkers serve may not receive optimal care. This article describes a professional development training module, designed to respond to this gap in training & knowledge often reported about protective services workers. The article provides an overview of the module as well as experiential exercises based on adult learning principles, which may support the transfer of participants' learning from the training room to their casework practice. The article also discusses the participants' ratings of satisfaction with this module, which indicated they perceived it as highly relevant. 1 Appendix, 30 References.

The Impact of Training on Worker Performance and Retention: Perceptions of Child Welfare Supervisors

Author: Kleinpeter, Christine B1; Pasztor, Eileen Mayers; Telles-Rogers, Theresa1 Dept Social Work, California State U, Long Beach

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61549581?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the impact of training on children's social workers performance & retention. One hundred & thirty supervisors of the Los Angeles County Dept of Children & Family Services were surveyed. Results revealed that supportive supervision & caseload/workload size contribute most to worker performance & retention, & were more important than pre-service or in-service training.

Turkey. A Generalist Approach in Social Work Education

Author: Bulut, Isil11 Dept Social Work, Health Sciences Faculty, Baskent U, Ankara, Turkey Ibulut@baskent.edu.tr

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61392009?accountid=14925

Abstract: A global review of social work education reveals considerable similarity among countries as well as significant differences. Historically, programs of social work education are informed by humanistic values and encompass knowledge of social problems, an understanding of individuals and their environment in interaction, and method of intervention into social and human difficulties. At the same time, structure of social work within the educational system and the length of training vary considerably from country to country. There is no serious international standards' setting for social work education, programs, educators and students around the world. Education programs exist at differing levels of education and for differing periods of time. There are no worldwide data on the number and qualifications of teachers of social work, the number and characteristics of social work students, variations in curricula and type of practicum (Hokeenstad and Kendall, 2001; Hokenstad, Midgley, 1998). References. Adapted from the source document.

Organisational and Methodical Aspects of Drug and Addiction Prevention among Young People. Developments in the Ukraine, in Germany, Spain and Russia (Project Description)

Author: Sting, Stephan11 Instit Social Work & Welfare Studies, TU Dresden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61394967?accountid=14925

Abstract: From October 2000 to March 2003 the project has been coordinated by the institute of social work and welfare studies of the TU Dresden and financed by the European Commission (INCO-COPERNICUS-Programme). It was an international cooperation between the TU Dresden (Germany), the University of Internal Affairs and the National Technical University in Kharkiv (Ukraine), the research institute AREA in Valencia (Spain) and the Belgorod Juridical Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia) which was established for improving the knowledge base of drug prevention activities by the East European partners. The overall aim of the project was the analysis and elaboration of approaches to drug and addiction prevention. Under consideration of the specific conditions within the East-European countries this work should contribute to the development of pluralistic approaches towards health promotion which are embedded into an intercultural, European horizon.

The Civil War in Southern Sudan and Its Effect on Youth and Children

Author: Biel, Melha Rout

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375168?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Civil War in Sudan, which began in June 1983, has caused a numbers of social, cultural and economical problems for Sudan. Many social changes took place, not only in the southern Sudan, where the war has been fought since its inception, but also in the Sudanese Nation as a whole. In this contribution, I would like to give a short summary about the effect of the war on the Sudanese society, in general, and on youth and children, in particular. This is important, because youth and children are the future of every nation. Because the youth and children in southern Sudan are gravely affected by the current war, this article will specifically address these effects. Youth and children in the North of the country are, however, almost equally affected by the conflict. After discussing historical background of Sudan and its political and developmental condition, I will briefly summarize the social situation and the role of social work in Sudan during and after the conflict. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work in Republic of Buryatia

Author: Bazarova, Tatyana11 State U Buryatia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387679?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Republic of Buryatia is situated in Eastern Sibiria, the eastern coast of Baikal Lake. The total area of the republic is 351 thousand square kilometers. The capital of Republic is Ulan-Ude. The modern social-economic situation in Russia is extremely paradoxical and multiaspectual -- negative processes take place almost in all spheres of the society. The introduction of market economy principles, the process of privatisation, and the last economic crises in the Federation of Russia have brought many social phenomena - among them increasing poverty, homelessness and still high rate of unemployment are the worst one. It makes the changes in the state social welfare programmes and functioning patterns be implemented. Social problems are especially very important in the so-called "depressive" regions of Russia (Buryatia Republic is among those regions). The most important is the staff supplement of social services and the level of professionalism of people who work there. This problem consists of two aspects: first, the number of specialists with professional education of social workers is not enough; second, the level of professionalism of the workers is very low. Adapted from the source document.

'Businessology' and Social Work

Author: Harris, John11 School Health & Social Studies, U Warwick

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61352888?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is a spectre stalking social work in many countries of the world. That spectre is the belief that social work needs to be reshaped in the image of capitalist business enterprises, what we might term business ideology or 'businessology'. Within that belief, the explicit or implicit assumption is that social work should, as far as possible, function as though it were a commercial business concerned with making profits. In those countries most affected, the culture of capitalism has colonised social work as business thinking and practices have been introduced. The embrace of businessology in social work is presented as a neutral trend, to which all social workers can be committed, namely, the modernisation of social work and making it more efficient through the application of distinctive and valuable expertise. Adapted from the source document.

Policy Contexts of Social Work in Britain: The Wider Implications of 'New' Labour and the 'New Legal Regime'

Author: Penna, Sue

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61352834?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the relationship of New Labour's modernisation programme to these new forms of legality by examining two main policy areas & the welfare implications they are enmeshed in. The first is privatisation, & the second is social policy in the European Union. Examining these areas allows a demonstration of how much of the New Labour programme can be understood as a local implementation of a transnational strategy, how parts of that strategy produce much of the social exclusion it purports to address, & how social welfare, & particularly social work, are noticeable by their absence within policy discourses of the strategy. The paper details how the privatisation programme is considered to be a crucial vehicle for the further development of a transnational political-economy, where capital accumulation has been redefined as 'welfare'. In this development, frameworks, codes & standards are central, & the final section of the paper examines how the modernisation strategy of the European Union depends upon social policy marked by an employment orientation & risk rationality, aimed at reconfiguring citizen identities. The strategy is governed through an 'open mode of coordination', in which codes, standards, benchmarks & so on play an important role. The paper considers the modernisation strategy & new legality within which it is embedded as dependent upon social policy as a technology of liberal governance, one demonstrating a new rationality in comparison to that governing post-Second World War welfare, & which aims to reconfigure institutional infrastructure & citizen identity.

Social Work, Mobility and Membership

Author: Jordan, Bill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374994?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work is more involved in the collective life of its clientele than are other human service activities, because it is directly concerned with the bonds & conflicts between individuals, & the co-operative & competitive aspects of groups & communities. Hence it relies on being sited in organisations relevant to service users' lives, & on being able to influence these collectivities. This article argues that the 'organisational landscape' is being transformed, as commercial enterprises (more mobile & adaptable than either state or non-government organisations) take over important aspects of collective provision. The implications of this transformation for practice are analysed, by reference to examples from the United Kingdom in particular. References. Adapted from the source document.

Common Social Work Education Standards in the Nordic Countries -- Opening an Issue

Author: Juliusdottir, Sigrun; Petersson, Jan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61370147?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article analyses the option of common Nordic Standards for social work education in these countries. The option is viewed through the lens of trends in education in the different countries. In the article the notion of an Integrated Field Model is used to indicate the starting point for a common model of education. This model covers the field characteristics of Denmark and Norway and their current move towards a more research-based education. It also covers the research characteristics of education in Finland, Iceland and Sweden and their current move towards a new field connection based on research-oriented education. Some thoughts on international requirements on comparability and compatibility in this setting are addressed in the final section. References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Workers Involvement in Taiwan's 1999 Earthquake Disaster Aid: Implications for Social Work Education

Author: Chou, Yueh-Ching

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396009?accountid=14925

Abstract: On September 21, 1999, a strong earthquake devastated Taiwan's central areas and claimed more than two thousand casualties. Social work roles in the disaster aid were surveyed with standardized questionnaires six months after the earthquake; in addition, interviews of the key informants, documental research, focus groups and open-ended questionnaires were utilized to collect qualitative data. The study found that social workers had significant roles & functions in both rescue & recovery stages especially in linking the victims' needs with resources. Social workers, including from public & private sectors as well as from campuses including the faculties & students of social work departments, have been deeply involved in helping the victims. Regrettably, most Taiwanese social workers participated in the rescue aid with limited training in disaster aid; social work practice in disaster aid is not included in current curriculums of college level. This means that social work roles & functions in the disaster aid process have not been fully realized by Taiwan's society & professional education. Tables, References.

Practising Group Work: A Processual Account

Author: Sukhramani, Neelam1; Baig, Mohammad Imran1 Dept Social Work, Jamia Milia Islamia, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61501515?accountid=14925

Abstract: Group work has been a vastly practiced, but minimally documented, method in the Indian context. The present article is an attempt to narrate, as well as use a theoretical framework to analyze the experiences of working with a group in an integrated school. Efforts have been made to detail out each phase by delving into the nature of activities undertaken, the involvement that it elicited from the members, the group dynamics, & the role played by the group worker. The underlying aim of this record is to be able to provide a practitioner or a would-be practitioner a threadbare account of group work processes. 11 References. Adapted from the source document.

Observations from the Field of Faith-Based Organizing: Revitalizing Social Work Skills in Policy and Social Action

Author: Staral, Janice M11 Dept Social & Cultural Sciences, Social Work Program, Marquette U, Milwaukee, WI janice.staral@marquette.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61481259?accountid=14925

Abstract: Learning about & being involved in faith-based organizing increases awareness of social policy issues & provides another method of participation in social action & community organizing. This article links the organizing methods of Saul Alinsky to congregation-based or faith-based organizing. This article also introduces the following core concepts: one-on-ones, self-interest, agitation, doing actions, & initiating campaigns. Some consider this type of organizing controversial & confrontational, but utilizing these methods can help social workers claim their voice in fighting injustice. 44 References.

Which Clinical Methods Are Associated with Better Preparing Social Work Students and Practitioners for Managed Care, State Licensing, and Other Important Practice Areas?

Author: Kane, Michael N1; Hamlin, Eldwood R, II; Hawkins, Wesley E1 School Social Work, Florida Atlantic U, Boca Raton mnkane@aol.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61451056?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify which clinical methods were perceived as the most effective in preparing social work students & practitioners for the practice areas of managed care, state licensing, & others. The clinical methods were identified by ratings from a statewide sample (n=260) of licensed clinical social workers practicing in FL in 2002. Canonical correlation analysis (variate 1) found that the clinical methods of (1) task/secondary supervision in the field, (2) student reports/papers to the instructor, & (3) observation/feedback of client interviews in the field were significantly related to perceived higher levels of preparedness for work overall in managed care environments & for the specific skill of documentation. A second canonical variate found the clinical methods of (1) process recording, (2) audio-tapes, & (3) task/secondary supervision as significantly related to higher levels of preparedness for future practice areas, "work in the real world," & participation in an interdisciplinary team. Interestingly, process recording, audio-tapes, & task secondary supervision were inversely correlated to higher levels of preparedness for overall clinical social work practice & the state licensing exam. Implications & future research are discussed. 5 Tables, 45 References. Adapted from the source document.

How Victim Assistance Experts Rate Social Work Competencies for Professional Practice

Author: Danis, Fran11 School Social Work, U Missouri, Columbia danisf@missouri.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61505970?accountid=14925

Abstract: Crime victim assistance is an emerging field of practice. If social workers are interested in working with crime victims, what knowledge & skills do they need? Is there a fit between generalist social work competencies & those needed for work in this field? An expert panel of victim assistance professionals rated generalist social work competencies for their relative importance for practice with crime victims. The panel findings provide the social work profession with specific information on both the generalist & specific competencies necessary for practice with crime victims. Implications for professional development are discussed. 2 Tables, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Integrating Standardized Measures into Social Work Practice: An Exploratory Study of BSW, MSW, and Continuing Education Curricula

Author: Dennison, Susan11 Dept Social Work, U North Carolina, Greensboro

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61500961?accountid=14925

Abstract: Increased demands for rapid assessments, short-term treatment, & ongoing evaluation of client progress have necessitated that social workers more fully integrate standardized measures into their practice. Historically, however, the social work profession has not provided formal training on the use of standardized scales to students or practitioners. In this current outcome-based environment, social work education programs & social service agencies need to update their training to ensure that this area of practice is addressed. This article reports the results of a nationwide survey of BSW & MSW programs that examined (1) whether standardized measures were addressed in the current curricula; (2) the instructional formats being used; (3) how important social work educators view the inclusion of this material in courses; & (4) concerns that have surfaced around the integration of standardized measures into social work curricula. Implications for future research & training needs are outlined for both social work education programs & social service organizations. 20 References. Adapted from the source document.

Choosing Non-Positivistic over Positivistic Approach in Exploring the Meaning of Community Participation: The Rationale Process

Author: Mathbor, Golam11 Dept Social Work, Monmouth U, West Long Branch, NJ

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61548715?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper analyzes the rationale process for choosing the research methodology in studying the 'Perception of Effective Community Participation in Coastal Development Projects in Bangladesh.' The analysis is based on ontological, epistemological, & methodological assumptions of two competing paradigms: positivistic (as an alternative approach) & non-positivistic (adapted in this research project) paradigms in scientific inquiry. Finally, the paper will conclude what characterizes the conceptualization of studying community participation in coastal development projects, & how these influence the choice of the methodology (non-positivistic approach), the specific method (grounded theory), & the data collection techniques. A comparison between positivistic & non-positivistic orientation toward this research project has also been made. 2 Tables, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Das, Anandamohan1; Sinha, Debotosh1 Santiniketan Hospital

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61499253?accountid=14925

Abstract: There are no commendable legislations or rules & regulations enacted by the government in our country to prevent the misuse of sex determination tests. In plenty of nursing homes & private clinics, sex determination tests are being performed by the sonologists without any legal identity. So, to stop this menacing manifestation of sex determination tests or rather the abuse of genetic diagnostic technologies; social workers, doctors, & the government should come forward on a common platform & to see how the astounding & blessed advancement of diagnostic technologies could be channelized in a constructive & purposeful way respecting the ethical aspects of medical profession. This paper, under this background will try to gloss over the concept of genetic diagnostic technology & amniocentesis, popularity of the test, controversy & the consequences around amniocentesis. Lastly, action to be taken against sex determination & sex pre-selection tests along with role of social worker, doctors, & government will be highlighted. 21 References.

Abstract: This article identifies the key challenges confronting social work & human services in Australia. The implications of such challenges, in particular, managerialism, on the social work profession are examined. Future viability of the profession depends on its capacity to re-invent itself & engage in these fundamental contextual changes. Such a move necessitates the social work profession to adopt a change in its culture & orientation. 35 References. Adapted from the source document.

Managerialism and State Social Work in Britain

Author: Morgan, Steve1; Payne, Malcolm1 c/o Malcolm -- Manchester Metropolitan U, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496545?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two forms of managerialism are distinguished: generalist managerialism, that which affects the daily experience of social work practice & policy managerialism, that which affects the development of policy. The development of social work in GB led social workers to adopt the role of bureau-professionals, mitigating the inflexibility of the bureaucratic provision of welfare in state social services. However, through case studies of local government social services & probation services, the impact on this conception of social work managerialism through its adoption by new Right governments during the 1980s & 1990s is demonstrated. It is argued that distinguishing the impact of inflexibility in services through bureaucratization from the impact of policy managerialism, the inclusion of a wide range of stakeholders & ensuring advocacy for the voices of service users & the community mitigates the effects of managerialist bureaucratization. 45 References.

Managerialism in Social Work -- An Exploration of Issues in the United States

Author: Tropman, John E11 School Social Work, U Michigan, Ann Arbor

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448521?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the dimensions & importance of managerialism in social work. A three-part question -- "What?," "So What?," & "Now What?" -- forms an analytical frame that generates a frank deliberation on what actually takes place in social work agencies in the US. These social work agencies, as a whole, are found to be under-led, under-managed & over-supervised. In order to make improvements for quality service to clients, specific & concrete suggestions are outlined for social workers' consideration. 101 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Advent of Managerialism in Social Welfare: The Case of Hong Kong

Author: Leung, Joe C B11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong hrnwlcb@hkucc.hku.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61500400?accountid=14925

Abstract: Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have been the major provider of social welfare services in Hong Kong. Facing an economic downturn, the Hong Kong government decides to enhance cost-effectiveness & accountability in social service through the introduction of market values & business management practices. Market-oriented practices include contracting out, competitive bidding, performance monitoring, & lump-sum grant. The appeal of these practices lies in the possibility of lowering costs, but their long-term effect on quality & stability of services is largely uncertain. With the emergence of competition & deregulation in social welfare, NGOs have to face formidable challenges to change their traditional philosophies & mode of operations. The reform implicates the redefinition of the relationship between the government & NGOs, & between social workers & their NGO employers. This paper points out the need to adopt a cautious & consensus approach to introduce welfare reforms. 49 References. Adapted from the source document.

Determining Performance Standards for the Supported Employment Service in Hong Kong

Author: Chan, Charles C1; Wan, Deborah L Y; Lui, Wacy W S1 Dept Applied Social Sciences, Hong Kong Polytechnic U, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61499633?accountid=14925

Abstract: With the new managerial system of Funding & Service Agreement (FSA) in Hong Kong, the performance standards in social welfare services are still difficult to define. In this paper, the problems & difficulties arising from the current method of determining performance standards in the Supported Employment Service (SES) were first examined. The current formulation was also considered inadequate for the consideration of the actual service recipient outcomes. Research data from a university & a rehabilitation organization partnership revealed the complex relationship among service quality, service output, & service recipient outcomes. A conceptual model with variables considered as crucial by service operators & researchers was mapped out for better service accountability. This "percentage of best fit" model which was formulated by the empirically derived typologies of SES pathways & service recipients was suggested to form the performance standards. Significant implications include offering a workable alternative to the over-reliant, yet unsatisfactory use of mean discharge rates as the major performance standard in FSAs. This model also helps clarify information on who would fit into what kind of SES modules & for how long they would produce the best outcomes. The applicability of this empirically derived model to other social services should be further explored. Finally, this paper should be regarded as a practical response to the present demands for service quality & best value outcomes, based on an integrated use of clinical social work skills & empirical research methods. 2 Tables, 20 References.

Interpreting Workers' Resistance to Welfare "Reform"

Author: Yi, Chan Fung1; Fan, Chu Shuk1 Dept Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61503770?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents & analyzes the background to the resistance of many frontline welfare practitioners against the recent introduction of reforms to the welfare management & subvention system & process in Hong Kong. The "progress" discourse optimistically engaged in by the government is challenged by a rather pessimistic assessment by workers, accompanied by a strong critique of the compromises welfare management groups have agreed to when accepting the Lump Sum Grant proposal. The context of the reform is interpreted as a strategic repositioning by the post-1997 government, intent at rebuilding its legitimacy & re-assigning the role of the welfare sector within its vision for the future. In the course of a long conversation between the two authors, one an academic, the other a core organizer in the "Alliance for the Protection of Welfare," several important areas of discourse were touched on: the nature of welfare & its normative underpinning; social workers' struggle to relocate themselves within the emerging managerial paradigm; the search for an environment in which dialogue between the various parties would allow open negotiation about a more positive reform of the welfare system. The relationships among workers, management, government, & service users are interpreted within a historical perspective, looking back at the constitution of the problem on both the level of Hong Kong as well as, more theoretically, on the level of (Western) welfare states. 24 References.

Interventions on Garbage Pollution Using Integrated Social Work Practice Framework

Author: Nadkarni, Vimla V11 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work, Tata Instit Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61523425?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper is based on the author's experience of applying the integrated social work practice (ISWP) framework to biological disasters in urban environments & to specifically strategize on the issue of garbage pollution with its public health consequences in a slum colony in Mumbai. This framework is based on the concepts developed by Goldstein (1973); Lippitt, Watson, & Westley (1958), & Pincus & Minahan (1973). Problem solving was based on the Pincus & Minahan model, which borrows from the systems model. In this particular case, it is the first time that ISWP has been demonstrated as a viable approach for dealing with garbage pollution within an urban, micro-community setting through mobilization of women & youth. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 19 References.

Empowerment of Grassroots Leadership in Health and Population: A Training Experiment in Karnataka

Author: Sekhar, T V11 Population Research Centre, Instit Social & Economic Change, Bangalore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61480388?accountid=14925

Abstract: To empower Gram Panchayat members on issues related to population & health, a pilot training project was carried out by the Instit for Social & Economic Change in 1998 in one district of Karnataka state. This training project was conducted with the help of modules & video documentaries using locally available resource persons. The training methodology developed in this project was found to be appropriate, participatory, & less time-consuming. A post-training evaluation revealed that the training contributed significantly not only toward enhancing the level of awareness & self-confidence of local leaders, but also toward improving their performance with regard to the provision of basic health facilities. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Interventions for e-Governance, Decentralised Democracy, Panchayati Raj and Sustainable Development: Challenges and Opportunities

Author: Sivakumar, Damodaran11 Population Research Centre, U Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61498781?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines how information technology can be used in social work practice & government in India with the goal of furthering sustainable development. It is argued that the growth of "digital democracy" & "e-governance" can help decentralize governmental functions & increase citizen participation. Social work must be part of a multisectoral & multidisciplinary team effort to overcome India's gross illiteracy problem & improve every household's access to digital/information technology. The ongoing program of massive decentralization in Panchayati Raj is described, & a multidimensional model linking sustainable development, information technology, e-governance, & social work practice is outlined. Applications of the model to a variety of social problems are demonstrated. 1 Figure, 5 References. K. Hyatt Stewart

Disaster Response in India: An Overview

Author: Parasuraman, S1; Unnikrishnan, P V1 Action Aid, Asia Regional Office

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61541123?accountid=14925

Abstract: 'Act of God' or 'Act of Man,' a mind boggling spectrum of disasters wreak havoc in the Indian subcontinent. Disasters are a shared reality spanning individuals, villages, blocks, districts, states, nations, & even regions, & have to be responded to with a multi-pronged approach. About 211 million people are affected by 'natural' disasters every year. According to the World Disasters Report, 67% of the people affected are from countries with low human development index (International Federation of Red Cross & Red Crescent, 2001). Experts note that the poorest are becoming more exposed to disaster risks. Political insensitivity, increasing poverty, climatic change, & globalization are the major factors that amplify the vulnerability & impacts of disasters. Disasters set back the development process by decades. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 2 Boxes, 7 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61523965?accountid=14925

Abstract: The supercyclone that hit Orissa in 1999 displaced & destroyed human life & material possessions. A team of volunteers from the Tata Instit of Social Sciences worked closely with the state machinery in three key areas, establishing temporary shelters, formulation of a village development plan, & evolving an income-generation plan with the affected people. The processes involved in each of these tasks, the issues that emerged, & the lessons learnt from our experience form the focus of this article. 2 References. Adapted from the source document.

Creativity and Practice Teaching

Author: Phillipson, Julia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61499233?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article considers the need & opportunities for creativity in practice teaching & in practice. After alternative beginnings of examples, debate, & requirements for creativity, the article looks at the current context of social work & social care & the extent to which this context constrains & endorses creative approaches. A brief look at some ideas about the nature of creativity as a quality, skill, & approach are followed by suggestions for developing & naming creative practices in practice teaching. This article has grown out of an invitation to talk about creativity at a practice teachers' conference followed by a period of sporadically pertinent reading, writing snippets, musing, & trying to sustain personal creativity. The article is therefore a mix of personal experience, dialogue, exploration, & ideas for experimentation. As with much creativity, it is provisional -- unpicking ideas as well as weaving threads & seeking new understandings & practice; a journey with detours rather than an arrival at a known destination. 31 References.

Creative Assessment: Involving Service Users in Student Assessment in Social Work

Author: Thomas, Ralph11 U Birmingham, Selly Oak, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448767?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores a range of issues about involving service users in student assessment. It provides methods of conducting further discussion about the issues by giving the scenarios & guidance information used successfully at six conference workshops to stimulate discussion among practice teachers. The hope is that others will make use of these & contribute to the development of good practice in this area. The existing literature about the issues is examined and, drawing from that literature & the workshop outcomes, the article provides guidance toward a model of successful inclusion of service users in student assessment. 13 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429084?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article shall trace the history, values, & political dynamics which have influenced the development & current status of the American social service delivery system. It shall look at how a more holistic & structurally sensitive service delivery model might appear within the current system of managed care & privatization of human services. It shall review two existing frameworks that provide an alternative illustration of how future services might be organized & delivered. Finally, it shall also sketch the history & present challenges facing social work field education & review an innovative project for students that put into practice the provisions of a revised model of service delivery. 1 Figure, 74 References.

The Creative Possibilities of Supervision

Author: Hogan, Fergus11 Dept Social Care, Waterford Instit Technology, Ireland fhogan@wit.ie

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448772?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article suggests a reimagining of what the supervision relationship might look like. It explores the possibilities of subverting the traditional hierarchical model of student social work supervision, replacing the expert teacher/student learner relationship with a more collaborative sharing of learning within the supervision container. It suggests a number of creative tools that might be used to encourage & support students in their efforts to develop as reflective social work practitioners. 21 References.

The Voluntary Sector and Social Work Education: Distant Relatives?

Author: Worsley, Aidan1; Hardwick, Louise1 Dept Applied Community Studies, Manchester Metropolitan U, Didsbury

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61498320?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work at universities is at the critical interface of social welfare & social work as a profession. Social work education in England is required to prepare social workers for regulatory work, therapeutic work, meeting academic requirements, & the development of a critical perspective that distinguishes the social work role from other caring professions. Increasingly these complex & sometimes competing aspirations have placed the emphasis on universities meeting training requirements for statutory social work at the expense of developing these therapeutic skills & a critical autonomy. This article will argue that for too long universities have been content to deal almost exclusively with government & statutory agendas with the resulting loss of contact with the voluntary sector, & in turn service users, & communities represented by them. Social work as a whole is in danger of losing touch with the broad needs of welfare which are often found outside statutory social work especially at a time when the state is increasingly withdrawing from obligations to those in need of welfare. Any statutory social worker will testify to the broadening gap between need & provision & to fill that gap voluntary agencies are taking increasing responsibility for the elderly, the mentally ill, the socially excluded, young people, & childcare. 22 References.

The Advanced Practitioner: Beyond Reflective Practice

Author: Nathan, Jack11 Social Work & Care Section, Health Services Research Dept, David Goldberg Centre, Instit Psychiatry, London jacknathan54@hotmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61499592?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper attempts to reconcile the practice realities faced by social workers & agencies on a daily basis, with the modernization imperatives set out by the State in requiring an enhanced social care service. The policy initiatives supporting this agenda represent an exciting historical opportunity for social work. To take up the challenge of creating a sound professional base for the provision of a high quality social work service, the organizational context & the relationship between the Agency, the Academy, & Practitioner will be explored. The paper will then look at what constitutes the Advanced Practitioner, using the conceptual framework provided by Schon's (1987, 1992) notion of the reflective practitioner. This paper presents a vision of a profession that has a unique contribution to make, among the other human service professions. It is argued that unless this challenge is taken up & made a practice reality, the professional base of social work could be further eroded. 4 Figures, 1 Appendix, 43 References.

Practice Teaching beyond the Caseload: Creating Opportunities for Practice Learning in the New UK Social Work Degree

Author: Shapton, Mike11 NE Worcestershire Coll, Bromsgrove, UK mshapton@ne-worcs.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525772?accountid=14925

Abstract: In May 2002, the UK Dept of Health announced that one of the requirements of the new honors degree in social work would be for students to 'spend at least 200 days gaining required experience & learning in practice settings' (Dept of Health, 2002). This represents a big challenge when many programs struggle to provide the existing requirement of 130 days. This article offers some proposals for seeing this expectation as a chance to create a more differentiated approach to practice learning rather than seeking to provide more of the same. It argues that differentiation is essential to providing increased quantity but also an effective way to raise quality & improve readiness to practice. This could be achieved by building on existing piecemeal approaches to learning about practice in groups & other environments, coupled with moderating placement demands to ensure quality standards can be met consistently. 5 References.

'A Virtual Placement.' The Creation of an Interactive, Web-Based Program to Prepare Students for 'Live' Placement

Author: Doel, Mark1; Cooner, Tarsem Singh1 School Social Work & RNIB Rehabilitation Studies, U Central England, Birmingham

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61494511?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, the authors tell the story of the creation of a Web-based program of learning for students preparing for practice. The program is called 'A Virtual Placement', & aims to prepare students for an actual placement. The authors do not promote virtual placements as an alternative to live placements, nor as some kind of 'imitation,' but as a complement to them, & possibly as a substitute for some of the functions that are currently expected of the live placement. The progress from screenplay to electronic format is charted, with discussion of the dilemmas which arose from harnessing the new technology appropriately. The authors reflect on the way in which their ideas for a virtual placement developed & changed, & the significance of metaphor & play in shaping these ideas. The article should help put the program itself in context, & the authors hope that readers will feel encouraged to visit the website, which is freely available at www.hcc.uce.ac.uk/virtualplacement. 16 References.

Facing Exclusion: The Nomadic Communities in Western India

Author: Bokil, Milind11 Development Support Team, Pune

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61431939?accountid=14925

Abstract: Traditionally, nomadic communities in India have suffered from societal neglect, injustice, discrimination & even disrespect of their human rights. At present, their survival is threatened due to loss of traditional occupations. In spite of this, their plight is not sufficiently attended to by the existing social work policy & practice, which mostly focuses on sedentary communities. The peripheral nature of these communities & the transitional phase of development present a great challenge before social work today. 6 Tables, 6 References. Adapted from the source document.

Development, Disasters and Displacement: An Appraisal of Policy for Resettlement

Author: Barnabas, A P

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61530114?accountid=14925

Abstract: The consequences of displacement of persons, whatever the cause (human made or natural disasters) are multidimensional. These include landlessness, joblessness, homelessness, marginalization, food insecurity, community disarticulation, & so on. Vulnerable groups (weaker sections, women, & so on) are more acutely affected. A policy for rehabilitation should be appraised from the viewpoint of whether it responds to these several impacts. The various policies for rehabilitation of displaced persons (due to development projects, natural disasters, deforestation, & so on) as presently operational are inadequate. The need is for a more humane approach. 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work in India: A 'Bright' Future?

Author: Kumar, Ajit11 Matru Seva Sangh Instit Social Work, Nagpur

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61513697?accountid=14925

Abstract: The liberalization era is accompanied with criticisms of Indian achievements & by extension the state. Surmounting the complexities of caste, religion, language, & history, an industrial base & a democratic polity have evolved. Enormous problems remain & the market is seen as the panacea. Would these problems find a place in the new order when the existence of the nation-state is a question mark? Under conditions of deprivation & inequality, would weakening the ability of the state to mobilize resources & prioritize investment further the manifest goals of social work? Growth of the market economy will apportion the cast offs to the care of the social worker who, intentions notwithstanding, can play only a limited role in alleviating human misery arising out of structural forces. 21 References.

A Time to Support Fatherhood

Author: Dudley, James R1; Fagan, Jay1 Dept Social Work, U North Carolina, Charlotte jrdudley@email.uncc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61551315?accountid=14925

Abstract: The lead article for this special issue draws attention to the dangers facing fatherhood in the US today. Several groups of fathers are identified whose parenting roles could be at-risk. They include fathers who are no longer in their children's lives, are functioning in underutilized ways, &/or are struggling with limited preparedness. At-risk fathers comprise several types of residential & nonresidential fathers identified in this article. Residential fathers could include lower income fathers without adequate employment, single custodial dads, & fathers with special needs children. Nonresidential fathers whose parenting could be at-risk include noncustodial fathers whom are divorced, teen dads, & unmarried adults. The article highlights the problems that these fathers could be facing, & some of the ways that they can be effectively helped. A special approach is called for that builds on their strengths, is culturally sensitive, considers many system levels of intervention, & promotes a broad base of support for fatherhood. 48 References.

September 11, 2001: Implications for Social Work Practice and Education

Author: Miller, Joshua11 Smith Coll School Social Work, Northampton, MA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61524339?accountid=14925

Abstract: The terrorist attacks on the US on 11 Sept 2001 & the ensuing domestic & international events have raised questions about how best to prepare for, & respond to, such large-scale disasters & the role of social workers in that process. This article considers the potential implications of 11 Sept for social work practice & education, particularly continuing education. The article describes the relief effort mounted to respond to the World Trade Center disaster in New York City & the service delivery problems that emerged. The article concludes with a number of recommendations: (1) placing US social work in more of a global context; (2) ways to prepare for future responses to acts of domestic terrorism; (3) the need for social workers to challenge civil rights infringements & ethnic & religious scapegoating; & (4) the need for a renewed commitment by social workers to advocate for health & income security for all Americans. 26 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61492827?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores the process & outcome of an interdisciplinary project titled "Law & Social Work Housing/Home Care Project," developed within the setting of a law school to provide social work & law students the opportunity to work together to assist vulnerable clients in need of both legal & social work services. This article describes how the project was developed & provides examples of clients served at the clinic. In addition, problems are identified that affect the ability of social work & law students to work collaboratively. Recommendations are provided by professionals in the field, former students at the clinic, & supervisors of the program in an effort to increase teamwork. This article describes a model for teaching collaboration when seeking to develop or enhance interdisciplinary programs within organizations. The hope is that detailing this experience will be of help to others who decide to replicate this model or establish similar collaborations within an organization that employs professionals. 32 References.

Federal and State Policy Initiatives to Strengthen Fatherhood: Issues and Implications for Practitioners

Author: Brotherson, Sean E1; White, Joseph M1 Dept Child Development & Family Science, North Dakota State U, Fargo

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61543833?accountid=14925

Abstract: The exploration of ideas & mechanisms for assisting men in their paternal responsibilities encompasses a wide range of possibilities. Demonstration research projects, grassroots educational programs, & community-led initiatives all have a role in shaping fathers' lives & activities. The development of state & federal-level policy approaches to strengthen fatherhood is an important trend among these efforts. This paper provides a brief conceptual & historical perspective on public policy initiatives related to fatherhood, reviews the status of current federal & state policy initiatives to strengthen fatherhood, & discusses implications for practitioners working in contexts where responsible fatherhood is an issue, including work with low-income fathers, teen fathers, incarcerated fathers, & fathers in other circumstances. 1 Figure, 64 References.

Demystifying Client-Outcomes: Identifying, Monitoring, and Using Client Outcomes in Child Protection

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61483202?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work education programs invariably include courses in research methods. These courses may or may not include information about how to develop, measure, & monitor client outcomes. Nonetheless, when social workers enter the field, they will ultimately be faced with the responsibility of identifying program goals & objectives & monitoring client outcomes. This article describes the various processes pertaining to developing, measuring, & reporting client outcomes. Using child protective services as an exemplar, a model for initial development & use of client outcomes is presented. Implications for continuing education in social work are presented. 1 Table, 6 References. Adapted from the source document.

Public-Private Mentoring for Leadership and Service Quality

Author: Kelly, Michael J1; Lauderdale, Michael L1 School Social Work, U Missouri, Columbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61482173?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper describes a mentoring program for public & private sector managers to introduce leadership skills & total quality management (TQM) methods. Managers experienced with TQM in the private sector were matched with public managers from a state human services agency & guided through a joint systematic development process to transfer leadership & quality management skills. The multiyear project was designed & supported by the professional continuing education staff of a research university with state & foundation funding. Evaluation results suggest that the project was successful, even though most of the mentoring relationships did not last throughout the project. 2 Tables, 34 References.

Social Work Practitioners and Technology Transfer

Author: Scheyett, Anna1; Roberts, Amelia C; Kirk, Raymond1 U North Carolina, Chapel Hill

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61482197?accountid=14925

Abstract: The application of new skills & interventions into the practice community is often slow & haphazard. A coaching intervention is proposed to augment traditional social work education techniques & maximize the integration of new knowledge into social work practice. This coaching model includes assessment of a practitioner's readiness for change, stage-wise coaching interventions, assessment of organizational barriers to the transfer of new information, & development of strategies to address these barriers. Implications for social work professional development & future research are discussed. 60 References. Adapted from the source document.

Perspectives of a Reform Commission: Ensuring the Role of Fathers in Their Children's Lives

Author: Clark, Kathleen A1; Leite, Randall W1 Ohio State U, Marion

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61543868?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 1998, the 122nd General Assembly of the State of Ohio created the Ohio Task Force on Family Law & Children (Task Force). The General Assembly had concluded that the parent-child relationship is of fundamental importance to the welfare of a child, & that the relationship between a child & each parent should be fostered unless inconsistent with the child's best interest. The Task Force was instructed to make recommendations on how to create a more civilized & constructive parenting process for children whose parents do not reside together. Qualitative & quantitative data regarding the impact of separation & divorce upon childhood development was obtained through six months of testimony from locally & nationally recognized experts & through reviews of the latest research findings. This article synthesizes the data concerning the importance of the father-child relationship, & delineates the role of social workers in a task force. 3 Tables, 45 References. Adapted from the source document.

Distance and On-Campus MSW Students: How They Perform and What They Tell Us

Author: Glezakos, Agathi1; Lee, Cheryl D1 Dept Social Work, California State U, Long Beach

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429345?accountid=14925

Abstract: The debate over the quality of distance education (DE) in social work programs is ongoing. In an attempt to assess the relative merits of this emerging pedagogy, a questionnaire was administered to 56 DE & 44 on-campus (OC) graduating students. The instrument assessed practice competencies in the domains of knowledge, values, & skills. There were no competence differences between the two groups. In addition, the DE students were asked to rank their required courses for goodness of fit for DE instruction. Research & thesis courses were ranked as the least appropriate. Recommendations include increasing the amount of DE programs, developing refined outcome assessment tools, & continuing research. 3 Tables, 23 References. Adapted from the source document.

Nonresidential Never-Married Fathers: Policy Advocacy Opportunities

Author: Stone, Glenn11 Dept Family Studies & Social Work, Miami U, Oxford, OH stoneg@muohio.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61481596?accountid=14925

Abstract: The issues related to divorced fathers & their children have received considerable attention in the research literature. We have grown in our understanding of how to improve the post-divorce relationship between father, child, & mother. However, much less attention has been paid to the issues faced by nonresidential never-married fathers & their children. This is unfortunate, for the rate of children born into never-married relationships is on the rise. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a clearer picture of the issues faced by these fathers. In addition, this paper will explore micro & macro practice suggestions that could prove useful in maintaining a positive relationship between the nonresidential never-married father & his child, & the child's mother. Furthermore, the information provided in this paper could serve as a valuable aid in the professional development of social work practitioners, who need information on how to best serve these fathers. 39 References.

Social Work Strategies for Sustaining Paternal Involvement among Unwed Fathers: Insights from Field Research

Author: Johnson, Waldo E, Jr11 School Social Service Administration, U Chicago, IL wejohnso@midway.uchicago.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61516367?accountid=14925

Abstract: In-depth interviews with a Chicago sub-sample of both unwed fathers & mothers in the Fragile Families & Child Well-Being Study, conducted at six weeks & again at three months following the focal child's birth, builds upon subsequent survey analysis examining paternal involvement among unwed parents. Collectively, the findings form a conceptual framework for examining & facilitating paternal involvement & family development via the couple relationship context. Social work practice strategies, building upon a strengths-based perspective, are proposed with a focus on engaging an often overlooked & underserved member of the family in professional practice & advocacy-the unwed father. Findings are directed toward the development of promising social work interventions for children & families, while simultaneously advancing the aim of social work practice. 1 Appendix, 51 References.

Social Work Education: Some Unresolved Curriculum Issues

Author: Siddiqui, H Y11 Dept Social Work, Jamia Milia Islamia, New Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484373?accountid=14925

Abstract: The paper argues that social work education currently suffers from a lack of focus in terms of its professional identity. It should become more focused in terms of the specific skills it wishes to impart to its learners & prepare students for specific professional tasks identified as developmental or curative, rather than becoming too ambitious. More curriculum space is needed for achieving higher-level, specialized skills. The students should have some space to construct their own agenda of learning & practice. 18 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61472633?accountid=14925

Abstract: The ultimate goal of the MRCP (Maharashtra Rural Credit Programme) Project is to contribute to poverty alleviation among the rural poor through improved financial services. This study is an assessment of the impact of the MRCP on: (1) credit delivery institutions, (2) project borrowers, & (3) social issues. The methodology used was a combination of quantitative & qualitative methods. The primary method of data collection was a survey conducted Mar-June 1999. During this time, 600 direct borrowers were selected for interviews. The authors outline the results of this survey & present a profile of the project area. It was determined that this project was more effective in its reach than almost all its predecessors because it has been able to increase the income & well-being of customers. E. Sanchez

Author: Khinduka, Shanti K11 George Warren Brown School Social Work, Washington U, Saint Louis, MO

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61472327?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in the 20th century in increasing life expectancy & spreading freedom & democracy, serious problems of poverty, environmental degradation, gender discrimination, racial & ethnic discord, & social inequality persist in most parts of the world as we enter the 21st century. A dynamic profession of social work, committed internally to knowledge development & to furthering the competence of its members & externally to high quality care giving & to substantive institutional reform, must carve out a role for itself in meeting the great challenge of our time: balancing economic development with social equity. 27 References.

Critical Issues in Multidisciplinary Child Sexual Abuse Allegation Investigations

Author: Cheung, Monit11 Child Welfare Education Project, Graduate School Social Work, U Houston, TX

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61497662?accountid=14925

Abstract: During the past ten years, research in the area of investigative interviews of child sexual abuse has focused on the child victim. Current literature in this area can be grouped into eight interrelated categories: (1) the developmental aspects of memory recall, (2) understanding children's language, (3) avoidance of repeated questioning, (4) validation & children's credibility, (5) false allegations, (6) videotaping interviews, (7) using anatomical dolls, & (8) interviewing techniques. A growing concern is the use of developmentally appropriate techniques to avoid false allegations. A dual-focus approach in conducting an investigative interview & 12 guiding principles are recommended for improving social workers' knowledge, skills, & attitude. 2 Tables, 71 References.

Indigenization of Social Work in Hong Kong

Author: Yip, Kam-Shing11 ssksyip@polyu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61485995?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work indigenization is a necessary reflection under the Western cultural imperialism. However, indigenization is a highly complicated & multidimensional process. The nature of social work is also controversial & diversified. In this paper, the process of indigenization of social work practice in Hong Kong is discussed, arguing that social work practice in Hong Kong gradually removed its attachment to the "Westernized model" to reflect local social & cultural contexts. In the 1990s, the debates on indigenization began to gain momentum for a more comprehensive & holistic reflection on social work practice in Hong Kong. 50 References.

Nei Jin Etiology

Author: Ng, Siu-Man

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61513358?accountid=14925

Abstract: Inner Canon is the oldest Chinese medicine book in existence. It has detailed discussions on etiology & established the theoretical foundation of Chinese medicine. Due to its huge difference from the Western medical model, Chinese medicine itself is a unique academic system. This article attempts to compare the etiology models of Chinese & Western medicine, & discuss the implications for clinical practice. For over 2000 years, Inner Canon has established the holistic view & dual-factor etiology as the foundation of Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine practitioners have accumulated much clinical experience in multilevel & multidimensional treatment & rehabilitation approaches. Many of these approaches can be borrowed by social workers. Incorporating these interventions with Western theories & skills can provide more comprehensive services to persons suffering from mental disorders. 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Measurement of Family Violence

Author: Bhatti, Ranbir S1; George, Tony Sam1 Dept Psychiatric Social Work, National Instit Mental Health & Neuro Sciences, Bangalore, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429208?accountid=14925

Abstract: The measurement of family violence is beset with various difficulties, both methodological & theoretical. A sound theoretical model to conceive & understand family violence is still lacking. The multifactorial systemic model is proposed as a comprehensive framework to understand family violence. This model assumes that various societal, cultural, & sociopolitical developmental phases of a developing society bring a variety of changes in the value patterns of the system. Such transitional phases disrupt the traditional homeostasis. Many built-in programs of a system start diluting into an unknown search for new adaptations. During this period to develop morphogenesis becomes extremely challenging for the family as a system. In order to seek the desired conformity from a fellow family member, the family may use any means, including physical, verbal, emotional, or intellectual violence. This paper presents an attempt made to measure the components of family violence using a tool developed to measure the patterns, severity, & frequency of family violence among families with children having psychiatric & neurological disabilities. The overall development of the tool is presented with suitable theoretical background & field data. 4 Tables, 32 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Gandhi, Anjali11 Dept Social Work, Jamia Milia Islamia, New Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61523696?accountid=14925

Abstract: Violence against women within marriage is rampant & often assumes multiple forms. It has attracted the attention of civil society, nations, & the international community. Wife abuse is an area of concern for social work as it threatens to nullify everything that the profession stands for. Student social workers have shown an increased sensitivity & inclination toward the subject of unequal power relations within marriage. In this paper, a curriculum of gender-aware social work with special emphasis on wife abuse is introduced. 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abuse and Neglect of Elderly in Families

Author: Srinivas, S1; Vijayalakshmi, B1 Dept Social Work, Andhra U, Visakhapatnam, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61481692?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data were gathered from a quota sample of 140 elderly subjected to abuse &/or neglect by their family members in Visakhapatnam, India, using a modified form of the Conflict Tactics Scale. The results indicate that the most likely victims of elder abuse are widowed women, elderly with poor economic background, & dependent. As regards the forms of abuse, verbal abuse of the elderly was reported most frequently, followed by material abuse & neglect. A sizeable portion of the respondents have reported physical abuse. It was also found that abuse has negative implications -- social, psychological, & behavioral -- for the elderly. Further, the data indicated that the son, the daughter-in-law, & the spouse (in that order) are the most frequently reported abusers. It is recommended that programs should be designed to provide adequate opportunities for participation of the elderly to reduce their social isolation & to provide support services to families caring for the elderly to help reduce caregiver stress. 7 Tables, 22 References.

Abstract: The social work profession in the US possesses a long tradition of promoting social justice in carrying out social work practice. While social justice has served an admirable purpose & continues to play a significant role in social work practice, close scrutiny of the social justice concept reveals shortcomings. This article examines how human rights can translate into a valuable tool for social work practice. 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Kane, Michael N1; Hamlin, Elwood R, II; Green, Diane1 School Social Work, Florida Atlantic U, Boca Raton

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61530477?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work practitioners & administrators in public, private-for-profit, & private-not-for-profit agencies (total N = 66) rated 23 skill & knowledge items identified by Vandivort-Warren (1996) as critically important to managed care & privatized service delivery environments. Respondents ranked cultural competency (79%), systems thinking (77%), clinical case management (65%), client participation in treatment (64%), & practical research skills (58%) as the most important skill & knowledge items. Respondents believed it was the responsibility of the university to provide knowledge & skill training for these items. Items with lower rankings were viewed as a collaborative educational responsibility between the university & the agency. All knowledge & skills listed were analyzed in relation to gender, venue of instruction, employment setting, & agency type. Implications for classroom, field, & continuing education are discussed. 2 Tables, 54 References. Adapted from the source document.

Re-Thinking South Korea's Special Graduate Education as a Continuing Education Resource

Author: Shin, Junseob11 Dept Social Welfare, Konkuk U, Chungju-City, Korea jsshin01@kku.ac.kr

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61529233?accountid=14925

Abstract: The need for continuing social work education in South Korea is growing. A rapid expansion of social work education during the 1980s produced a large number of practicing social workers in the field. Some of them are currently at the middle-management level in a variety of social work agencies. Continuing education programs for social workers in the field, however, have not been well developed. Based on a survey of 216 graduate students enrolled in both general master's programs & special graduate programs in social work, this study analyzed characteristics & functions of each program. An exploration of the special graduate program as a continuing education resource was then approached & possible implications for activating continuing education in South Korea were drawn. 8 Tables, 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Using a Pretest-Posttest Design to Evaluate Continuing Education Programs

Author: Barton, Thomas R1; Dietz, Tracy J; Holloway, Linda L1 Dept Rehabilitation/Social Work/Addictions, U North Texas, Denton barton@unt.ecu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61530554?accountid=14925

Abstract: To retain licensure or certification, social workers throughout the nation are required to participate in continuing education programs that, at a minimum, attempt to impart new knowledge. The pretest-posttest design is a simple, yet methodologically flawed, way to evaluate such programs. Reported are the results of an experiment that evaluated the impact testing has on pretest-posttest evaluations. We find that participants who completed both a pretest & posttest have virtually the same posttest scores as participants who completed only a posttest. Findings suggest that this design can be used to conduct meaningful evaluations of programs intending to increase participants' knowledge. 2 Tables, 1 Appendix, 15 References.

Inside-Outside: Boundary-Spanning Challenges in Building Rural Health Coalitions

Author: Dunlop, Judith M1; Angell, G Brent1 c/o Angell -- School Social Work & Criminal Justice Studies, East Carolina U, Greenville, NC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61524283?accountid=14925

Abstract: Trends in reforming human services systems challenge social workers to become effective boundary spanners. As government strategies of decentralization & devolution are implemented, social workers interested in leadership roles will need to understand how to manage the multiple external organizational relationships created by coalition building. This paper presents a conceptual framework for understanding boundary-spanning functions & issues, applies this framework to rural health coalitions, & offers guidelines for teaching about how community practitioners, as boundary spanners, can be more effective in managing the institutional & interpersonal relations involved in coalition building. An understanding of the dual roles that social workers play inside their own organizations & outside -- as members of coalitions -- offers an opportunity for social workers in rural health settings to play a major leadership role in building collaborative networks. 34 References.

Author: Patel, Chhaya11 Faculty Social Work, M. S. U Baroda, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61425423?accountid=14925

Abstract: This case study consists of critical narratives covering such aspects as composition of students, recruitment, training, & upgrading of teachers & structure of curriculum. Indigenous practice opportunities were created by founding, initiating, supporting, or using the existing infrastructural laboratory, such as an institutional network of social defense, social welfare, medical & rural development service agencies, & other centers in & around Baroda. This institutional network of the school proved highly beneficial to all involved: students, teachers, researchers, agency personnel, functionaries receiving training, & the clients among the wider community of Baroda region. The indigenizing ethos, values, & philosophy enshrined in the foundation of the school are described. The article concludes by commenting on the impact of a newly added self-financed Master of Human Resource Management degree program. 22 References. Adapted from the source document.

National Seminar on Rural Development and Human Rights Violation in Western India

Author: Barik, B C1; Katare, P M; Seth, Supriya1 School Social Sciences, Swami Romanand Teerth Marathwada U, Nanded, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61475200?accountid=14925

Abstract: The proceedings of this seminar, organized by the School of Social Sciences at Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada U in Nanded in Feb 2000, are summarized. The focus of the 16 papers presented was on the effects of the massive development schemes for rural areas on the rights of the rural population, especially those marginalized. It was concluded that despite landmark progress in the agricultural sector in western India, the fact that 33% of the population live below the poverty line is a civil rights violation. M. Pflum

How a Minority Tribal Group in Nepal Has Reacted to Oppression -- A Book Review Essay

Author: Visvesvaran, P K11 Madras School Social Work, Chennai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61475172?accountid=14925

Abstract: A review essay on a book by T. B. Subba, Politics of Culture: A Study of Three Kirata Communities in the Eastern Himalayas (Chennai: Orient Longman, 1999), which recounts the efforts of the heterogeneous Kirata tribal group to recreate their culture, religion, & languages despite the lack of tolerance for diversity in Nepal. The Kirata history, culture, & political, economic, & social organization are discussed, & compared with those of the Hindus & other groups in Nepal. The overall ethnographic methodology is commendable, but the author's theory of marginalization, that outsiders have severely marginalized the Kirata through inmigration, is weak. The author warns that a situation of confrontation is brewing. This fascinating narrative has both academic & practical import. 5 References. M. Pflum

Is Good Will Enough? Practice Teaching in the Voluntary Sector

Author: Irvine, Julie1; Hubbard, Anne1 Division Adult/Community/Primary Care, U Northumbria, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61482257?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article investigates the perceived rewards of practice teaching for social work practitioners working in small voluntary sector organizations. It is argued that this sector is often ignored in social work education, & that the views of those playing a key role in assessing practice competence have been marginalized in practice teaching literature. Through interviews with a number of practice teachers from a North East voluntary sector consortium, the rewards of practice teaching as a distinct activity are identified from a personal & organizational perspective. These views are placed in the context of changes in the way social work services & social work education are currently organized & delivered. The findings suggest that practice teachers gain several benefits from teaching students, but also use practice teaching as a means of promoting particular forms of social work & the voluntary sector itself. Strategies to improve the profile of practice teaching & relationships with other partners in social work education are discussed. 3 Figures, 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Night Porters: A Portrait of Practice Teaching and Placement Provision in One Scottish Local Authority, 1998-2000

Author: Henery, Neil

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445871?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is widespread recognition that current arrangements are unsatisfactory in relation to the quantity & quality of practice placements. CCETSW attempted to tackle the issues with its accreditation policy 12 years ago. This study looks at the provision of placements in one Scottish local authority & concludes that accreditation has not worked. Practice teachers identify lack of workload relief & lack of management support as key factors discouraging them from providing placements. It is suggested that the structural separation of placement provision from organizational work plans is at the root of the problem. The metaphor of practice teachers as the night porters of social work education helps to explore the causes & implications. Bringing practice teaching into the daylight means improving the visibility, status, & group identity of practice teachers. If this is done, current efforts to establish a competent social work service stand a better chance of success. 2 Figures, 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Developing Poverty Teaching and Practice for Social Work Students: A Community Profiling Approach

Author: Ferry, Alan1; Watson, David1 Glasgow Caledonian U, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61482275?accountid=14925

Abstract: Poverty is an issue that has always proved problematic for social work both at a policy & practice level. It has caused controversy & debate within the profession around whether it is a circumstance to be challenged by social workers, & if so, in what way. However, with the inception of the Diploma in Social Work in 1991 & its revision in 1995, this debate took another turn with the requirement that qualifying students should have a knowledge & understanding of the impact of poverty on service users. Social work courses were now required to move poverty into the mainstream of their teaching strategies. This paper outlines the planning processes & thinking involved in the development of a module titled "Poverty, Deprivation & Discrimination" on the BA/DipSW for mature students with family commitments at Glasgow Caledonian U. In particular, it considers the issues involved in developing the teaching of the module away from traditional methods, towards a more reflective & experiential approach, where students assume greater responsibility for their own learning. Central to this approach was the development of a Community Profiling exercise, which was used as a tool to bridge the gap between theory & the beginnings of an anti-oppressive practice. 20 References.

Attitude and Participation of Farmers under Water Users' Associations in Kerala

Author: Chandran, K Madhava1; Varadan, K M; Valsan, T1 Centre Water Resources Development & Management, Kozhikode

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61466954?accountid=14925

Abstract: A study was conducted to quantify the relationship between attitude of farmers & their participation in the activities of Water Users' Associations under the Command Area Development Authority (CADA) in Kerala. There is a significant relationship between the two. The participatory activities have been explained through relevant social theories applicable to irrigation management. Lack of activities like provision of farm channels, rotational water supply, consolidation of landholdings & group farming, were found to be the reasons for low farmer participation. Based on the study, factors relevant for Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) for decentralized irrigation have been identified. 5 Tables, 20 References. Adapted from the source document.

Disasters and Mental Health

Author: Jaswal, Surinder11 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Deonar, Bombay, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496487?accountid=14925

Abstract: The 1990s were recognized as the decade for natural disaster reduction by the United Nations General Assembly in 1987 (World Health Organisation, 1992). Besides the death caused by natural disasters such by earthquakes, windstorms, tsunamis, floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions, wildfires & other calamities, it is being increasingly recognized that the definition of disaster has widened to include human-made events such as riots, fires, industrial disasters, building collapses, mass dislocation due to political unrest, insurgency, conflict, & internal displacement. Further, it is also recognized that "the smallest & poorest countries are affected most severely by both natural & man-made disasters, & the poorest & most disadvantaged members of a disaster affected community are likely to experience the most serious consequences" (United Nations Disaster Relief Organisation, 1984). Therefore, in the majority of developing countries, consequences of disasters, due to their severity & frequency, represent a real public health priority. 2 References.

Disaster Mental Health: A Current Perspective

Author: Juvva, Srilatha1; Rajendran, P1 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61458767?accountid=14925

Abstract: Disasters, both human-made & natural, are a very sorrowful experience. It is even more so when one becomes a hapless victim to a disaster. The consequences & aftermath of a disaster leaves behind a plethora of issues to target & handle. Often, mental health work occupies a lower priority in disaster management. It is also a widely neglected area with very few disaster mental health professionals to offer their services. In the wake of recurring disasters all over the world, many helping professionals have woken up to the reality facing us, & current scientific literature abounds in information & materials in disaster management, preparedness, mitigation, relief, & rehabilitation. Yet, literature on disaster mental health is scarce. Drawing from the experiences in a recent disaster, the authors highlight the role of disaster mental health work & its impact in disaster management. The need to incorporate disaster mental health strategies in training of relief workers, officials, & trainers at both the governmental & nongovernmental organizations will also be highlighted. 21 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61458255?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reports on the impact of the ongoing political unrest on the mental health of low-income urban people in Srinagar. The Kashmiri translation of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire 20 (SRQ-20) was used to assess current psychiatric morbidity in the respondents in Baramulla. The SRQ-20 was validated against the ICD-10, which was used as a gold standard. A cut-off of 11/12 was arrived at by testing for sensitivity & specificity. The findings of the study indicate high mental health morbidity in the respondents, especially in homemakers & in unskilled workers as a result of the ongoing long-term unrest & the consequent trauma in the region. 2 Tables, 3 Figures, 17 References.

Killari: Psychosocial Health of a Village Ravaged by an Earthquake

Author: Gandevia, Katy11 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61504333?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper begins by highlighting the events following the devastating earthquake that struck the Marathawada region of Maharashtra on 30 Sept 1993. Killari, a once flourishing village, was reduced to a heap of rubble overnight. Destruction to life & property was immense, but the psychological trauma faced by the people was no less. Many families had to cope not only with complete destruction of their homes but had to come to terms with death of their loved ones. After the initial rush of material relief, the families found themselves lonely & then despair struck many of them. Psychological evaluation undertaken by the Maharashtra Instit of Mental Health, Pune, indicated a high level of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, especially among the women & children. The author then tries to outline the coping mechanisms adopted by the villagers of Killari, the changes that took place due to housing & other policies, & the effects they had on the social fabric of the village. 4 References.

Teaching Disaster Management: Addressing Complexities of Social Work Practice

Author: Pereira, Maveen Soares11 Dept Urban & Rural Community Development, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61458501?accountid=14925

Abstract: A course on "Disaster Management" is offered to social work students at the Master's level in the Dept of Urban & Rural Community Development at the Tata Instit of Social Sciences. The experience of teaching the course has been extremely interesting. Since much of the literature on disaster management is restricted to the postdisaster situation, the course has had to bring in the development perspective in a bid to seek sustainable solutions -- be they physical or psychosocial. Hence, the challenge is to prepare the mindset of students to address disaster issues not just on humanitarian & management principles, but with a perspective that includes foresight, relating to the intricacies of development processes, understanding vulnerabilities, & working within the dynamics of the nation-state. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Strategies for Empowerment of Self-Help Groups: "Participatory Research" and "Organizational Development"

Author: Mok, Bong Ho; Suen, Lai Sun; Tang, Chi Wing

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61533503?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper discusses the empowerment strategies of self-help groups from the perspectives of participatory research & organization development, with two practice projects carried out by the authors as illustrations. Results of the projects indicated that the self-help groups involved were empowered at individual & group levels, but not at social & policy levels. The authors point out that the function of self-help groups in Hong Kong is at present limited to saving social resources, resulting from self-help & mutual help. Self-help groups have a long way to go to achieve the goals of promoting equality, changing community power relationships, & redistributing social resources. 22 References.

Growing Up Poor: Why Adolescents with Economic Disadvantage Succeed or Fail

Author: Shek, Daniel Tan-Lei1; Lam, Ching-Man; Lam, Mang-Chow; Tsoi, Kcon-Wah; Tsang, Sandra Kit-Man1 Dept Social Work, Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin danielshek@cuhk.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61495996?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although studies have been conducted to examine the impact of poverty on child & adolescent development, they are plagued with conceptual as well as methodological limitations, & no systematic studies have been conducted in the Chinese culture. This study attempts to (1) examine the personal coping resources & stresses, particularly economic stresses, faced by poor adolescents; (2) understand the family environment of adolescents living in poverty; (3) investigate the extrafamilial environment of adolescents experiencing economic hardship; (4) examine the psychosocial adjustment of poor adolescents; (5) study the influences of individual, family, & extrafamilial factors on the psychosocial adjustment of adolescents in poverty; & (6) understand what characterizes poor adolescents who show signs of good adaptation (resilience) vs maladjustment (vulnerability).

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467418?accountid=14925

Abstract: A debriefing is a structured group process that responds to the collective experience of trauma as a consequence of disasters. This paper considers what a debriefing is, why it should be used, & then compares different debriefing models. A detailed example is provided of a debriefing model developed by a community-based team. The article concludes with an examination of how debriefings are consistent with social work theory & practice & offers suggestions for continuing education. The paper is informed by the author's experience as a member of a local community crisis response team. 2 Tables, 36 References. Adapted from the source document.

Single-System Evaluation of Child Protective Services Training

Author: Smith, Thomas Edward1; Schinke, Steven Paul; Springer, David W1 School Social Work, Florida State U, Tallahassee tsmith@mailer.fsu.edu

Abstract: Describes a study of training methods for child protective services workers in which 34 child protective services workers were tested before & after a 5-day clinical training program. A subset of workers was repeatedly tested within a multiple-probe research design to evaluate the effects of instruction, modeling, & practice. Posttraining gains were seen for workers' knowledge of child development & behavior change principles, facts about child abuse & neglect, & self-control & anger management abilities. Observational data on the subset of workers during protective services interviews showed increasingly more specificity, reinforcement, modeling, & rehearsals with a client as the workers learned each training method. Along with their observed clinical skills, workers in the subset reported progressively less anxiety, greater effectiveness, & higher predictions of future success with the child protective services client. Consumer feedback from all protective services workers supported the relevance, applicability, & value of clinical training. The behavioral training presented here can be replicated in practice settings. Innovating & evaluating child protective services curricula can be accomplished with single-system designs. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The mandate of the supervisor is to oversee the educational experience of the social worker. This responsibility is multifaceted. One important aspect of the job is to help the social worker integrate theoretical learning & practice. This article will explore the value & necessity of integrating theory in the practice experience & will help supervisors to better identify their own theoretical orientation(s). Suggestions for integration of theory into practice will be offered. 40 References. Adapted from the source document.

Status of Women in India: An Interstate Comparison

Author: Kanitkar, Tara1; Mistry, Malika1 Instit Health Management Pachod, Pune Centre, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663854?accountid=14925

Abstract: Uses data from the 1992/93 National Family Health Survey to explore the status of women in India. The indicators used were literacy & education, exposure to mass media, work status, age at marriage, fertility, & use of family planning methods. Analysis reveals that women in two states, Himachal Pradesh in the extreme North & Kerala in the extreme South, enjoy higher status per these indicators. The state of Rajasthan occupies the last rank. The analysis also shows that economically progressive states need not be socially progressive. Maharashtra occupies first rank as far as economic indicators are concerned; however, it does not fare well on other aspects of social development. 3 Tables, 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

Level of Development-Orientation in Educated Unemployed Young Men: The Reality

Author: Singh, Lal Bahadur1; Kumari, Renu; Kumari, Meera1 Dept Psychology, T. M. Bhagalpur U, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61672482?accountid=14925

Abstract: A randomly selected group of 400 highly educated young men, ages 25-35, equally divided into four categories -- technically & non-technically educated unemployed, & technically & non-technically educated employed -- were compared in terms of their level of development orientation & its dimensions measured by a 41-item 4-point Development Orientation Scale (Nasir, Rani, & Singh, 1995). All the groups were found to differ significantly from each other. It was apparent that the non-technically educated unemployed young men, followed by the technically educated ones, were clearly less development oriented, but, similar to their employed counterparts, they were not below moderate level. Moreover, both the unemployed groups scored high on risk-taking & low on liberal & progressive views. The employed groups were also high on risk-taking, but, unlike the former, low on egalitarianism. 2 Tables, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Challenges for Modern Social Work in Russia: Problems and Prospects

Author: Tregoubova, Tatiana11 Research Instit Professional Education, Moscow, Russia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61468882?accountid=14925

Abstract: Because social work as a profession appeared in Russia only in 1991, there is a deficit of social work experience & qualified personnel to solve the social problems of the Russian population. To what extent is real deterioration in social services, education, health care, & culture in the Russian society observed, or an explosion of negative information regarding persistent problems rather than an actual increase in the magnitude of those problems being seen? Moreover, to what extent are the negative features of the contemporary social situation in Russia the result of the politics of reform, & to what extent are the inevitable consequences of the USSR's totalitarian past? The normal functioning & development of social work & social services in Russia can be secured through radical changes in the people's attitude. It may be necessary to carry out public relations activities that will attract people's attention toward the social work role & challenges in Russia. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: In all that has been written since the devolution of welfare, only occasionally have we asked the recipients themselves what they think. This article presents the views of welfare recipients in MD regarding welfare reform & changes they recommend. Faithfully reporting the actual words of the recipients, the authors found that the suggestions for change fell into two broad categories: recommendations to improve the existing welfare programs & recommendations to transform the fundamental structure of the welfare system. 1 Table, 11 References.

Educational Challenges Facing Health Care Social Workers in the Twenty-First Century

Author: Rudolph, Claire S11 Syracuse U, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61503305?accountid=14925

Abstract: This abstract addresses the challenges faced by the social work profession in the present health care services environment, focusing on the education & training direction for current & future practitioners in the health care arena. Based on the history of medical social work in the twentieth century, a number of challenges in the delivery of health care services are discussed, raising important issues about the preparation of social workers for professional practice. Professional social work education needs to be restructured by forming new types of university, agency, &/or community partnerships where agency personnel participate fully in identifying the knowledge & skills needed in designing the curriculum. 31 References.

Professional Social Work Education in Child Welfare: Assessing Practice Knowledge and Skills

Author: Scannapieco, Maria1; Bolen, Rebecca M; Connell, Kelli K1 U Texas, Arlington

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467916?accountid=14925

Abstract: Historically, the profession of social work has held a leadership role in the field of child welfare. There has been a history of collaborations between schools of social work & child welfare & state child welfare agencies. Today, hundreds of these partnerships throughout the country (Zlotnik, 1997) are spending millions of federal dollars to professionally educate Bachelor of Social Work & Master of Social Work students for careers in child welfare. Unfortunately, there is not a corresponding proliferation of evaluation research that attempts to measure the effectiveness of these partnerships. This article provides a comprehensive description & evaluation of a partnership between a school of social work & a state (TX) department of child protective services. The evaluation focuses on student learning & an exploratory examination of practice changes in the agency. 5 Tables, 23 References. Adapted from the source document.

World-Wide Beginnings of Social Work Education

Author: Kendall, Katherine A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61665207?accountid=14925

Abstract: Records the evolution of social work education from the efforts of Victorian reformers in the late 19th century to remodel charity work as scientific philanthropy. To the extent possible, the story is told in the words of all the people involved. The very first school of social work, with a 2-year full-time program, was established in Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1899, but the real beginnings of social work education are found in Octavia Hill's training of volunteers in housing management & "friendly visiting" in London, England, in the 1870s. Expansion of this training in the 1880s, in cooperation with the Women's University Settlement, led in 1890 to an organized 1-year program of courses & field practice that evolved, under the direction of the Charity Organization Society, into the London School of Sociology, launched in 1903. In addition to the school already established in the Netherlands, the early 1900s saw a blossoming of schools or programs of social work in the US, the UK, & Germany. The first in Asia, Africa, & South America, which came later, are also described along with the legacies of these many beginnings. 1 Reference. Adapted from the source document.

Internationalising Social Work Education

Author: Cox, David11 Regional Social Development Centre, La Trobe U, Melbourne, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61620672?accountid=14925

Abstract: The time has come to make a conscious & concerted effort to internationalize social work practice & education in line with global developments. The three core global problems are poverty, conflict, & ecological degradation. Behind these problems are several root causes, eg, economic & political globalization, & flowing from the core problems is a wide range of more specific social problems, including displaced persons, prostitution, child labor, & rapid urbanization -- all with some global dimensions. If the world's core problems, their root causes, & consequent social problems are all international to some degree, social work is obliged to respond. Here, an analysis of the situation & of social work suggests that social work can contribute at all three levels depicted above, provided that social work education paves the way. 22 References.

Teaching of Social Sciences in Schools for Social Work

Author: Kulkarni, P D11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61620698?accountid=14925

Abstract: Emphasizes that the relationship of social science to social work is umbilical; eg, social work is applied social sciences. Applied syllabi can be prepared realistically & taught effectively only by the teachers having direct exposure to socioeconomic problems in the field. Multidisciplinary, separate, & parallel teaching is not enough; it must be integrated into this interdisciplinary approach. Scientific social research should be regarded as essentially useful for diagnosis & estimation of the dimensions of social problems, as a database for planning social programs, & for evaluation of social welfare services. 1 Reference.

Social Work Educators as Scholars: Some Animadversions

Author: Pathak, Shankar11 Dept Social Work, Delhi U, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61665928?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the role of the Indian social work educators as academics & scholars in a historical perspective. It is argued that, while social work educators have grown numerically over the past 6 decades & their economic condition has steadily improved, their performance as academics & scholars has been disappointing. The possible reasons for this state of affairs are explored. 18 References. Adapted from the source document.

Admission Criteria and Internal Assessment in a School of Social Work: An Analysis

Author: Visvesvaran, P K11 Madras School Social Work, Chennai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61655285?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examining admissions data (N = 308 candidates) from a school of social work, it is established that candidates' past performance (Bachelor's Degree) determines the outcome of the entrance test in a significant manner. Moreover, variations in grades received by the trainees seem to stem from differences in the teachers' approach to evaluation, rather than from true differences in performance. For greater transparency & fairness, a regular & candid appraisal of the evaluation process by teachers themselves is essential. 9 Tables, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Rane, Asha J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61665965?accountid=14925

Abstract: The creation of the Hamara Club, a project supported by India's Tata Instit of Social Sciences & designed to address the problem of street children in Mumbai City, is examined. An overview of the Hamara Club's historical background & primary objectives is presented. Additional information concerning the intervention strategies used & the services & programs offered through the Hamara Club is reported. The major achievements of the Hamara Club are identified: (1) having a positive effect on the lives of thousands of street children by providing health care, education, & training to them; (2) placing individuals with graduate degrees in social work in the program; & (3) permitting street children to participate in several local & national social campaigns. Different training modules used for training social workers & officials in addressing the street children problem are discussed. After considering the project's need for survival, it is concluded that the program should be turned over to a respectable nongovernment organization. 6 References. J. W. Parker

An Ongoing Journey: Learning from a Field Action Project in the Police System

Author: Dave, Anjali11 Dept Family & Child Welfare, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India Special Cell Women & Children, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61621175?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Special Cell for Women & Children, a program designed to study & intervene in domestic violence & violence against women, is explored. The program's 15-year history, extent of learning that has taken place between women & professionals, fund raising projects, & creation of a collaborative project between local police & the Special Cell are discussed. The role of the Tata Instit of Social Sciences in Mumbai, India, in training social workers assigned to the collaborative project is reviewed. The Special Cell has contributed to research in violence against women & children & has facilitated the introduction of gender issues into the police system. It is noted that police who participated in the project & then transferred to other regions of India implemented gender analysis into the new police departments. Although the Special Cell has gained the attention of the Indian state, it is concluded that the government has failed to provide additional support & resources for the project. J. W. Parker

Research into the Role of the Practice Assessor

Author: Schumann, Catherine1; Barraclough, John1 North London Practice Teaching Consortium, c/o Islington Social Services Staff Training & Development, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61494156?accountid=14925

Abstract: The research on which this article is based came about because the writers were aware of a discrepancy between practice teaching portfolios that were failed or referred by their program's assessment panel, but who were given positive recommendations by their practice assessor. The standard of the portfolio was not therefore being reflected in the practice assessor's recommendations. We wanted to know if this was happening on other practice teaching programs, & whether there were any internal factors within programs which contributed to more, or less rigorous practice assessment processes. The article contains statistical data from practice teaching programs throughout CCETSW's England Regions. We have also included some qualitative data gained from canvassing practice assessors from three different practice teaching programs & to their views about the practice assessment process. The research findings confirmed our experience in relation to the discrepancy between assessment panels & practice assessor recommendations, but threw up some surprises about how practice assessors function.

The Assessment of Incompetence: Practice Teachers' Support Needs When Working with Failing DipSW Students

Author: Sharpe, Mavis

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61458941?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper describes a research project that examined the support & training needs of practice teachers as they work with failing DipSW students. It was based on discussion & interviews with a sample of accredited practice teachers working on a "singleton" basis (ie, practice teachers who are practicing social workers, based in the same workplace as the student, offering usually only one placement at any one time). An account is given of the aims, background, methodology, & main findings of the study. The conclusions have implications for practice teacher training in respect of the fuller integration of the possibility of failure. They also indicate the need for more & different support systems for practice teachers that incorporate an understanding of the mourning process in an educational setting. The study was exploratory, & limited in scope. Thus, while it identified some issues appropriate for immediate implementation, it also highlights pertinent areas for further research. 18 References.

Author: Davis, Jean1; Rendell, Pauline; Sims, Dave1 Faculty Health, South Bank U London, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61483796?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores the assessment of practice learning on a joint Nursing & Social Work Studies course. Various models of placements have been developed to provide an appropriate learning environment, & three case examples are described & analyzed. Key issues particularly relevant to practice teaching in an interprofessional context are identified. Students' practice learning is assessed by an interprofessional practice assessment panel in an integrated competency framework meeting both social work & learning disability nursing requirements. Some general principles of practice teaching & learning in the training of the joint practitioner are discussed. 3 Figures, 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

Involving Service Users in the Assessment of Students in Professional Practice

Author: Cuming, Hilary1; Wilkins, Judi1 School Health & Social Sciences, U Wales Instit, Cardiff

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61469307?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper offers guidance for professionals on the involvement of service users in providing feedback about students on professional training programs in health & social care. It has resulted from recognizing the need not only to involve service users in the assessment of students, but also to develop the associated processes, &, therefore, some guidelines for service users, students, & practice teachers. We also wanted to provide the opportunity for service users to evaluate their experience of giving feedback about the involvement of Diploma in Social Work students in their lives. A small-scale research study, funded by the Wales Office of Research & Development of Health & Social Care, allowed this evaluation to take place. This work not only promoted & validated the current procedures used on placement in the practice agencies, but also enabled us to suggest these generic guidelines. 1 Figure, 1 Appendix, 13 References.

Assessing Reflective Practice: New Research Findings

Author: Ixer, Graham11 CCETSW, London, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61504165?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores the responsibility that practice teachers have in facilitating students' professional development through reflection. It puts forward the view that students must take responsibility for their own learning. There are differences in the needs of students & experienced workers, but both need the opportunity to reflect & develop. However, we need a shared understanding, both of what reflection is, & of the difficulties for workers in ensuring that they use that process to maintain professional practice of the highest standard. 23 References.

Practice Teachers as a Learning Community: The Experience of a Practice Teachers Training Programme in Social Work

Author: Tsang, Nai-Ming11 Dept Applied Social Sciences, Hong Kong Polytechnic U, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470471?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports the organization & evaluation of a Practice Teachers Training Programme in Hong Kong. The course objectives, content, pedagogical design, & feedback from participants are elaborated. The joining together of a group of practice teachers for a common purpose brings an end to their "lonely & private business." Cognitively, they are asked to locate their practice in relevant current literature. Emotionally they are exposed to the tension created by the role switch from "teachers" to "learners." They feel more connected in mutual sharing & support as a community of learners. Peer review of taped supervisory sessions with students is deemed valuable. Judgments & assumptions are examined. They are exposed to a variety of approaches, conception, & skills as seen from their professional colleagues in action. It is hoped that the experience in running this course will provide a useful reference for other educational institutions. 2 Figures, 45 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: There is very little research on on-site supervisors, who carry the detailed day-to-day work-based support of social work students. This model is increasingly being used as placements become more difficult to find & the need for a wide variety of learning experiences has been recognized. The authors provide the findings from a study in which face-to-face interviews were held with 27 on-site supervisors in both statutory & voluntary agencies within three Scottish regional consortia. The themes explored are training, perceptions of roles, supervision of students, contribution to the assessment process, relationships with practice teachers, communications with academic institutions, & benefits & difficulties of on-site supervision. Recommendations are offered which could enhance the important contribution made by on-site supervisors to the training of students. 7 References. Adapted from the source document.

AP(E)L and the Practice Teaching Award: Regulations, Experiences and Lessons

Author: Slater, Phil11 School Social Science, Middlesex U, Enfield, England P.Slater@mdx.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61469148?accountid=14925

Abstract: The development of flexible assessment systems must balance two competing demands: on the one hand, the maintenance of common academic or professional standards, &, on the other, the provision of effective learning opportunities tailored to discrete groups. AP(E)L routes to assessment for CCETSW's Practice Teaching Award have been at the cutting edge of such developments in the social work profession since 1989. After reviewing both the general meaning of AP(E)L systems & the specific background to the Award, this article distills the experiences of a pioneering Practice Teacher Program over the past 11 years. In particular, the article draws out the strategic significance of candidate self-evaluation, & reports on innovative approaches to teaching & learning in this area. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 18 References.

Developing Practice Learning: The Practice Teachers' Perspective

Author: Wilson, George11 School Social Work, Queen's U, Belfast, UK g.wilson@qub.ac.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61468619?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents a detailed study of the management, training, & support of practice teachers in one Area Health & Social Services Board in Northern Ireland. The article highlights the major strengths of practice teaching in Northern Ireland, including the high percentages of staff holding the Practice Teachers Award. The study, however, identifies similar problems to other parts of the UK in relation to practice teaching turnover & workload easement. Through exploring the perceptions of practice teachers, the article provides an analysis of these problems, & identifies the main ingredients of a comprehensive strategy for improving & developing practice learning. It is argued that the recommendations, arising from the study, are also applicable to other agencies seeking to develop the organizational & professional conditions essential for delivering high quality practice learning. 1 Table, 17 References.

Let's Develop Practice Learning in Eastern Europe: Innovation in Ukraine and Armenia

Author: Bridge, Gillian11 Dept Social Policy, LSE, London, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61505871?accountid=14925

Abstract: After the collapse of communism & the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many countries in Eastern Europe, including Armenia & Ukraine, turned to the West for help in developing social work training as a solution to their burgeoning social problems. As the integration of theory & practice was central to the success of these innovative projects, expertise in practice learning was required. The author was one of many academics & practitioners recruited from the UK to participate. This article describes & analyzes different strategies used to develop practice learning within the Eastern European context. The conclusion reached is that attempts to develop training in practice teaching were inappropriate, but that there remains considerable potential for nurturing practice learning initiatives within the surviving state funded agencies & the growing nongovernmental organization sectors of social welfare. 25 References.

Ethical Issues in the Assessment of the Value Base in Social Work Students

Author: Deacon, Lynda11 Open U, Leeds, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429586?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that student social workers must demonstrate personal & professional values & ethics that will make them culturally competent & allow them to practice in an anti-oppressive, antidiscriminatory manner. It is contended that oppression & prejudice are evident in college courses & social work practice. The CCETSW value requirements for social workers are delineated. The notion of "reflective practice" is discussed, emphasizing the need for educators to work at understanding reflection so they can teach students to assess & articulate their own value base to develop personal & professional values that will allow them to practice without inflicting damage on users or colleagues. 26 References.

Police Checks, Placements and Paedophiles

Author: Smith, Joanne M1; Thomas, Terry1 Dept Social Policy & Social Work, U Plymouth, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525585?accountid=14925

Abstract: Criminal record checks have been an accepted form of pre-employment vetting for those with access to children for some years but their role in social work placements remains variable across Diploma in Social Work programs. The police check system itself is not without criticism, but in the realm of placements, it becomes even more problematic. The authors of this paper highlight some of the complexities enmeshed in both the history of policy surrounding the police check & the implications for current implementation, particularly for social work students undertaking placements. 39 References.

Continuing Education across Boundaries: Exploring the International Exchange of Social Work Knowledge and Practices

Author: Traub-Werner, Beatrice11 School Social Work, U Toronto, Ontario

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467277?accountid=14925

Abstract: Internationalization has produced a situation where events in one part of the world has a direct impact on the rest of the globe. In all professions, especially social work & human services enterprises, the need for information exchange & cooperation has become necessary for collective survival. Upheaval in parts of the world has forced welcoming nations to search for ways to address the diversities that migrations entail. This journal has attempted to develop a journalistic dialogue that will help neighborhood life where social work exists to assist societal intervention. Internationalizing the professional development of social workers is the next step. There is a need for international exchanges in continuing education, & it is proposed that the journal devote a section or an entire issue to the discussion of a certain topic, problem, or situation from as many geographic & social settings as possible. 8 References.

The "Warmth" Profession: Societal Perceptions of Social Work Practice

Author: Hall, Ronald E11 Michigan State U, East Lansing

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61492037?accountid=14925

Abstract: Perceptions of social work evolved from a history of social services, including child welfare & mental health (Carlton-LaNey, 1999). Yet, critics have challenged its occupational status as a profession. According to critics, social work training is less rigorous, & its status less esteemed, giving its practitioners less right to privileged communication. In the aftermath, social workers are perceived as warm but not particularly intelligent. In fact, the generalist approach & grounding in ethics qualify social work training as rigorous & their practitioners as intelligent professionals. By & large, social work has arrived at professional status. However, it needs to further clarify & codify its technology. 41 References. Adapted from the source document.

Using Focus Groups to Design an Interagency Training Program for Child Welfare Workers

Author: Packard, Thomas1; Jones, Loring; Gross, Elizabeth; Hohman, Melinda; Fong, Terri1 School Social Work, San Diego State U, CA tpackard@mail.sdsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470711?accountid=14925

Abstract: A five-day interagency training program for child welfare, domestic violence, mental health, & substance abuse workers was conducted six times over two years. Interagency collaboration was the underlying emphasis of the training. To ensure the relevance & utility of the training, five focus groups were held with professionals from various disciplines & agency settings to receive suggestions on session content. Themes included cultural factors, definitions, assessment, intervention methods, & available community resources. Collaboration issues included roles, conflict resolution, consensus building, confidentiality, team building, & cultural dynamics. The groups also seemed to serve a marketing function, creating interest in the training, & they helped reinforce the credibility of the trainers & their design. Training content is identified; the focus group process should be of use to other training designers. 4 Tables, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring "The Managed Behavioral Health Care Provider Self-Perceived Competence Scale." A Tool for Continuing Professional Education

Author: Hall, Michael L1; Keefe, Robert H1 c/o Keefe -- School Social Work, Coll Human Services & Health Professions, Syracuse U, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470728?accountid=14925

Abstract: "The Managed Behavioral Health Care Provider Self-Perceived Competence Scale" was adapted from prior work on self-perceived competence & self-efficacy. The adapted scale emerged from a sample of private practitioners surveyed for their responses to questions concerning their self-perceived competence in interacting with managed behavioral health care organizations. The results indicate the development of a psychological dimension along which practitioners are operating as they balance their responsibilities to clients & managed care organizations. Continuing education programs may wish to use the scale to assist in evaluating workshops for practitioners working with managed behavioral health care organizations. 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 22 References.

Author: Kleinpeter, Christine Hagan1; Potts, Marilyn K1 Dept Social Work, California State U, Long Beach

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61492062?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study compares 35 on-campus & 41 distance MSW students enrolled in two summer block practice methods courses. The distance students were located at two rural universities linked through interactive TV. The comparison group was located at an urban university, taught in traditional classrooms. Comparisons were made on student grades, faculty evaluations, & field instructors' evaluations. Results indicate that no significant differences were found between on-campus & distance learners. 2 Tables, 31 References. Adapted from the source document.

Globalisation: An Opportunity for Dialogue between South African and Asian Social Work Educators

Author: Drower, Sandra J11 School Social Work, U Witwatersrand, South Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61646109?accountid=14925

Abstract: During the second half of the 20th century, the developing world has borne the brunt of the negative consequences of globalization. With respect to social work education & training, globalization has often resulted in inappropriate training, practices, & services. Through describing the various themes that arose during a visit by a South African social work educator to a number of centers in Asia, explored here is the pertinence of developing a dialogue between South African & Asian social work educators & trainers. It is concluded that such dialogue has the potential to be more empowering & beneficial for social work in these developing countries than continued deference to Western models of social work education & training. 1 Table, 26 References. Adapted from the source document.

Attitudes of the Student Youth and Middle Aged Persons towards the Elderly

Author: Rao, K Visweswara1; Prasad, B Devi; Avataramu, Ch1 Dept Social Work, Andhra U, Visakhapatnam, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61665106?accountid=14925

Abstract: Scale data from 75 university students & 114 rural, middle-age respondents (Rs) in Andhra Pradesh, India, are drawn on to assess their attitudes toward the elderly. Results indicate that the students & Rs not living with old people in their families, men, Rs belonging to disadvantaged sections of the society, & Rs from low-income groups hold more negative attitudes toward the elderly as compared to their counterparts. More specifically, poverty appears to be significantly associated with negative attitudes toward the elderly, which may be the consequence of lack of financial resources to care for them. It is recommended that programs be designed to integrate the aged into the family & social fabric, to bring the younger generations closer to the elderly, & to provide families with support services so as to enable them to take better care of old people. 3 Tables, 20 References.

Is Education a Priority for Scheduled Castes? A Study of Three Districts of Bihar

Author: Pant, S K11 Govind Ballabh Pant Social Science Instit, Allahabad, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61646151?accountid=14925

Abstract: Though literacy has been unanimously accepted as a very potent & significant social variable for bringing about socioeconomic & cultural transformation, & planners in India have placed significant importance on it, analysis of 4 decades of planned development shows that literacy has still to find a place among the weaker sections of the society, particularly the Scheduled Castes, who are ruled by social issues like poverty, unemployment, backwardness, apprehensions, & morbidity. Data obtained through the participatory rural technique are used to investigate the status of primary-level educational services for children in 54 villages in 3 districts of Bihar, & suggestions for improvement are offered. 10 Tables, 10 References.

Focus on NGOs as Agents of Social Development: A Book Review Essay

Author: Mahtani, Rajshree P11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61657159?accountid=14925

Abstract: A review essay on a book edited by M. C. Nanavatty & P. D. Kulkarni NGOs in the Changing Scenario (New Delhi: Uppal Publishing House, 1998) regarding nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in India. The volume consists of two sections: voluntarism, & professional education & development. While it is noted that important issues are raised, the work is criticized for the lack of integration between the two sections & the disjointed papers that were previously written for specific purposes other than the topic at hand. It is posited that this rather gloomy portrait of NGOs is not substantiated by any systematic research. Further, it is concluded that multipronged interventions will be needed to address the concerns raised. T. Noland

Author: Cauble, A Elizabeth1; Dinkel, Janice M1 Dept Sociology/Anthropology/Social Work, Kansas State U, Manhattan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470695?accountid=14925

Abstract: As social workers start using technology for continuing education program development & training, they are teaming with technical disciplines. This departure from traditional teamwork creates a new working environment with many challenges. A multidisciplinary training project using interactive multimedia technology is described. The benefits & challenges for social workers as well as other team members are discussed. The authors propose using social work practice methods to plan for & resolve difficulties as they arise in the multidisciplinary team. 1 Table, 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Educating Social Workers about Changes in the American Family: Evaluating the Impact of Training

Author: Buttell, Fred11 Coll Social Work, U South Carolina, Columbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61468021?accountid=14925

Abstract: Reports on SC's efforts to educate social work practitioners about various trends influencing the structure of the US family. Analysis of the pretraining data indicated that the participants were largely ill-informed about the rapidly changing family structure in the US. However, analysis of the posttraining data demonstrated that there was significant improvement in their knowledge of the program material. Implications of the findings for using continuing education as a forum for disseminating information about changing family structures are explored & discussed. 1 Table, 1 Appendix, 11 References.

Personality Comparison between On-Campus and Distant Learners: Implications for Continuing Social Work Education

Author: Hagan, Christine B1; Potts, Marilyn K; Wilson, Ginger K1 Dept Social Work, California State U, Long Beach

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61416811?accountid=14925

Abstract: The NEO-Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1989) was used to compare 37 distance learners & 53 on-campus MSW students on five facets of personality: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, & conscientiousness. Findings indicated minimal differences between off-campus & on-campus cohorts. Among distance learners, personality factors had negligible effects on student satisfaction. These findings suggest that personality factors have little influence on the successful recruitment & retention of distance education students. Such efforts might focus more productively on improving the learning environment in distance education classrooms. 2 Tables, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Cullen, Carolyn T1; Champagne, Vae L; Zischka, Pauline C1 Education & Community Services, Big Brothers Big Sisters New York, New York

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61463542?accountid=14925

Abstract: As youth mentoring emerges as a rapidly growing field, social work continuing education can play a significant role in providing the specialized training necessary for individuals who supervise volunteer mentors. A new partnership model between a social work continuing education program & a mentoring agency is described which provides training to social service staff in the area of youth mentoring. The authors discuss the increasing need for mentoring staff training, benefits of such a collaboration, & feedback from training participants. The development of a standard curriculum by which individuals may earn credit could be a major contribution to the mentoring field. 1 Table, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Curry, Dale1; Chandler, Theodore1 Northeast Ohio Regional Training Center, Summit County Children Services, Akron

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61468867?accountid=14925

Abstract: Describes a brief mail survey questionnaire postcard used as an outcome indicator to promote research & assess training effectiveness for human service personnel. A study of almost 600 child protective social workers utilized the Human Services Training Effectiveness Postcard (HSTEP) to assess perceived impact of training on the job & to explore factors that influenced training application. Information on the reliability & validity of the tool is discussed. A survey questionnaire that assessed 11 transfer factors (Transfer Potential Questionnaire) provided supportive data, which helped strengthen the validity of the HSTEP. As information technology begins to spread rapidly & widely, its impact on social work is inevitable. 7 Tables, 2 Figures, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Since 1995, groups of social work practitioners have participated in a professional education experience, sponsored by the U of Georgia Continuing Education Program in association with the U of Veracruz (Mexico) for 10 days of language instruction, cultural immersion, home stays with Mexican families, visits to social service agencies, & daily social work seminars. The goal of the experience is to expand the skills of practicing social workers toward becoming bilingual & culturally competent for work with Hispanic/Latino clients. The program is described & results are summarized. 23 References. Adapted from the source document.

Hong Kong Satellite Children in Canada: An Exploratory Study of Their Experience

Author: Irving, Howard H1; Benjamin, Michael; Tsang, A K Tat1 Faculty Social Work, U Toronto, Ontario

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61511256?accountid=14925

Abstract: Astronaut Chinese families are those in which one or both parents spend much of their time in Hong Kong or Taiwan, leaving their satellite adolescent children to complete their education in Canada. To explore the experiences of these children, interviews were conducted with 68 of them living in Toronto, Ontario. Responses were examined using thematic analysis & the software program -- NUD-IST. Three meta-themes emerged, concerned with ethnic identity development, the socially constructed character of immigrant adolescent experience, & the salient role of time in their adjustment to resettlement. Practice/policy implications are discussed. 74 References. Adapted from the source document.

Personal Epistemology of Social Work Students

Author: Tsang, Nai-Ming11 Dept Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61535043?accountid=14925

Abstract: The issue on theory practice integration in social work brings attention to the difference between positivist & social construction epistemology. The "Attitude about Reality Scale" developed by Unger et al (1986) tries to measure the personal epistemology of students toward logical positivism & social constructionism. A modified form of the scale was used to measure the personal epistemology of 723 social work students or graduates. Significant differences were detected between diploma & degree students. As social work knowledge is increasingly affected by social constructionism, the implications for further research are discussed. 6 Tables, 1 Appendix, 36 References.

Marxist Approaches to Western Psychiatry: A Preliminary Examination

Author: Mondal, Parthasarathi11 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61625150?accountid=14925

Abstract: Mainstream psychiatry, with its progressivist undertones, has recently come under attack from some viewpoints that draw their inspiration from Marxist tenets. According to their understanding of human behavior, mental illness, & the nature of the community's responses to the problem, the critiques become identifiable as reformist, environmentalist, structural, labor theory, & democratic psychiatry. They show how economic considerations & class forces have been important guiding factors in societal responses to mental distress across the ages, & how mainstream psychiatry has played a role in controlling mental distress as a part of the overall needs of socioeconomic & political governance in Western capitalist societies. 10 References.

Social and Educational Problems of Scheduled Castes: Some Critical Insights

Author: Wankhede, G G11 Unit Research Sociology Education, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61625177?accountid=14925

Abstract: Critically analyzes the social & educational problems of the Scheduled Castes in India, with particular reference to the educated members of this caste in their social contexts. Statistical data & previous research demonstrate how social problems obstruct the motivation level, quality, & utility of education. Although education carries inherent handicaps, it has proved to be the best means for the overall development of the Scheduled Castes. However, their emotional achievements must be analyzed within the parameters of their sociocultural & economic conditions. Therefore, their past must be linked with the present, which directly affects their educational progress. 8 Tables, 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Outlines some of the social & ecological disasters faced in India as a direct result of globalization. The oppressive roles of the World Bank & World Trade Organization, as well as the inherently political nature of globalization, are discussed. The total control agendas of multinational conglomerates, comprising patent rights, intellectual property rights, & technological tools, constitutes a rejection of both social & environmental responsibility on the part of the firm; specific examples are cited. It is argued that such corporate monopolization of the vital basis of life necessarily engenders a corresponding disintegration of democracy. It is suggested that globalization will also create democratic opportunities that must be seized if India is to reclaim its social & ecological heritage. T. Noland

Globalization, Technology and Continued Professional Education

Author: Kelly, Michael J1; Lauderdale, Michael L1 School Social Work, U Missouri, Columbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61503273?accountid=14925

Abstract: This special issue on social work continuing education explores some of the more salient factors seen to be influencing the direction of professional continuing education. Briefly, there are four analytically separable but intertwined changes that will, when taken together, influence how CE professionals will conduct their work. The first factor is globalization of business & social services including changes in consumer demand. The second is the resulting changes in organizations as they respond to competitive pressures via staff involvement & continuous learning. The third is the computerization of the workplace &, finally, the fourth, the "blurring" of the distinction between formal education, credentialing, in-service training, & continuing education. 21 References.

Abstract: The authors examine important new technologies that are available to those that provide professional continuing education. They examine the recent traditions of how programs were designed & provided & offer some criticism of the shortcomings of that process. They explain the more salient technologies that are now available, how they can be used, & the likely impact such approaches to education will have on traditional faculty & institutions. 13 References.

The Failed Promise of Hypertechnology in Social Work

Author: Kreuger, Larry W1; Stretch, John J1 School Social Work, U Missouri, Columbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467396?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors argue that the "worldwide hypertechnology assemblage" has not lived up to its promise. They are concerned about a shift from worker-client face-to-face dynamics to impersonal photographic images. The importance of nonverbal cues has been greatly diminished, as a further example of quantitative over qualitative. The authors have adapted a set of nine recommendations, developed in 1992 by Mander, which suggest ways in which the social work profession should respond. 52 References. Adapted from the source document.

Paradigm Shifts and E-Training Preparedness

Author: Pittman, Sharon Weaver11 School Social Work, Andrews U, Berrien Springs, MI

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467408?accountid=14925

Abstract: E-training opportunities abound. Organizations that remain entrenched in traditional methods will find themselves obsolete. Shifts in approach to staff training & development may be nominal or radical depending on the organization's historical responsiveness to the infusion of technology. Adapting Tapscott's (1996) model for defining paradigm shifts, the author suggests parameters that organizational leadership can use to develop a value-added approach for 21st-century staff development & training. Also provided is a Training Shift Readiness Assessment Tool that can be useful in evaluating an organization's preparedness for the next millennium. Survey outcomes can suggest areas where the equipment or software may need to be updated. 1 Table, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

New Information Technology and Social Work Education in South Korea

Author: Kim, YoungJong11 Graduate School Social Welfare, Kyung Sun U, Pusan, South Korea

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525827?accountid=14925

Abstract: The author describes the current state of technological development & its impact on social work education in South Korea. During the 1990s, there has been a general consensus on the usefulness of borrowing information technology for the social work profession & education. The idea has not, however, been fully developed because of various obstacles, including the high costs of utilizing those technologies. Now the costs are being lowered at rapid rate, & as information technology begins to spread rapidly & widely, its impact on social work is inevitable. 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

Internet Technology and the Assessment of Supervisors: A Unique Perspective for Professional Development and Continuing Education

Author: Landuyt, Noel11 School Social Work, U Texas, Austin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61468008?accountid=14925

Abstract: The author focuses on the task of upper-level management in mentoring & in guiding the development of lower-ranking supervisors. This may include overseeing areas of continuing education. These tasks require access to accurate & pertinent data. The author explains how a general assessment of organizational functioning, using the Survey of Organizational Excellence, creates a need for specific continuing education. The use of Internet technology captures employee perceptual data basic to successful work with the supervisors. 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

Infusing Technology into the Social Work Curriculum

Author: Gustafson, Lee F1; Kuhn, Austin1 Lewis-Clark State Coll, Lewiston, ID

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525865?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors report on an illustration of the soon to be routine use of information technology in traditional undergraduate teaching. It suggests what will quickly become the norm in social work education & will prove to offer an extensive set of new relationships with field agencies. It also illustrates a knowledge gap that may rapidly develop between persons educated in social work some years ago & the more technologically capable new graduate. The authors suggest agency partnerships as a means of closing that gap. 2 Tables, 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Saroja, K11 Dept of Human Development, Rural Home Science Coll, U of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61619457?accountid=14925

Abstract: Identifies adverse social dynamics acting overtly & covertly against the expected growth of intercaste marriages in India, despite the forces of modernization, increased education & employment of women, & increased social interaction of young people of different castes. The nexus between the adaptations of the caste system to the needs of the young people & the continuation of both arranged marriage & caste endogamy is elaborated. The emergence of opposition from caste & communal forces to intermarriage is also noted. 34 References. Adapted from the source document.

Exparte Divorce: An Overview

Author: Badiger, Manavva S1; Krishnaswamy, Saroja1 AICRP, Dept of Human Development, Rural Home Science Coll, U of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61613202?accountid=14925

Abstract: Exparte cases constituted 33% of all divorce cases in Dharwad District, India, 1986-1990, & 91% of all exparte spouses were found to be homemakers, childless, mainly from rural areas, & ignorant of the legal implications of exparte divorce & their loss of claims for husband's property & alimony. Here, through a detailed case study approach, these cases are examined to highlight the sociocultural & legal dynamics leading to divorce & the consequent hardships to exparte wives, emphasizing the imminent need for enhanced legal awareness. 5 Tables, 4 References.

Multicultural Issues within Universities: Identifying Trends and Challenges

Author: Kulig, Judith1; Pfeuti, Lucia; Thorpe, Karran; Hall, Barry L1 School of Nursing, Regional Centre for Health Promotion & Community Studies, U Lethbridge, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61637240?accountid=14925

Abstract: A challenge is put forth to professional faculties such as social work in universities to ensure the delivery of programs that encapsulate multicultural perspectives. An extensive review of primarily North American literature shows that progress has been made, but many challenges remain. Social work educators need to be more culturally aware & incorporate teaching strategies that accommodate the full range of multicultural education. 95 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Far Cry? Revisiting the Prospects of Community Cooperation in Rural South Asia

Author: Khan, Niaz Ahmed11 Dept of Public Administration, U of Chittagong, Chittagong, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61649642?accountid=14925

Abstract: Sheds light on the practical premise of community cooperation & reexamines the contextual (administrative & social) realities in South Asia with an end toward assessing how conducive these realities are in fostering cooperation in rural frontiers. It is argued that any cooperative effort has to be understood & appreciated in light of the contextual conditions.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61644793?accountid=14925

Abstract: Farm women in India play a significant role in most of the postharvest operations in pulses, oilseeds, & coarse grains. Focus here is on the extent of these women's adoption of postharvest technologies & their perceived training needs in this regard. Survey data from 160 such women in Tamil Nadu are used to identify the prospective roles of extension workers in the women's adoption of such technologies. Appropriate strategies toward this end are proposed. 4 Tables, 4 References. Adapted from the source document.

Towards Gender Equity: Reflections of a Police Officer

Author: Chakravarty, S11 Administration of Maharashtra Police

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61640060?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on 25 years experience working in the Maharashtra (India) Police, it is argued that interrelated & reinforcing patterns of sex inequality exist not only in police work, but throughout the institutions of family, community, market, & state. Discussed is how women can be empowered through education, economic independence, & gender awareness. A plea is made for Indian legislation barring sex discrimination in the workplace, similar to the UK Sex Discrimination Act (1975), & gender sensitivity training for government employees is advocated.

Asian Indian Women and Feminism: A Double-Edged Sword?

Author: Allen, Robin1; Nimmagadda, Jayashree1 School Social Work Boise State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61612746?accountid=14925

Abstract: Addresses the struggle of social work practitioners in working toward social justice while maintaining cultural & ethnic sensitivity. Issues specifically related to social work practice with Asian Indian women who have immigrated to the US are explored from a strength-based perspective. Possible directions for practice with the growing Asian Indian immigrant population that are both ethnically sensitive & empowering are suggested. These approaches were generated through developing an understanding of the rich history & sociocultural context of the lives of women in India. By understanding how Asian Indian women have struggled against oppression in their own country, opportunities for assisting them in overcoming oppression in the US can be discerned. 34 References.

Life Satisfaction of Single Parents in Hong Kong

Author: Lee, Mo-Yee1; Law, Chi-Kwong; Tam, Kwok-Kwan1 Coll Social Work Ohio State U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61671520?accountid=14925

Abstract: Concepts derived from North American studies are used in developing a model to investigate the contributions of various factors to the life satisfaction of single Chinese parents in Hong Kong. Path analysis of mail questionnaire data (N = 230 respondents) indicate that household income & time sufficiency in child care positively predict life satisfaction of single parents. Perceived difficulty in child care negatively predicts life satisfaction, while employment has both positive & negative effects. Implications for assisting single parents are discussed. 1 Table, 2 Figures, 49 References. Adapted from the source document.

Supervisor or Superhero: New Role Strains for Frontline Supervisors in Human Services

Author: Jones, Martyn11 Social Work U Exeter

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61630726?accountid=14925

Abstract: Representing a meeting point between professional & organizational interests, supervision has become a contested site of change & resistance in the reconfiguration of human services. It is argued that initiatives to introduce & implement policies & standards for supervision are illustrative of a more strident professional response, but a more far-reaching reappraisal of the purposes & forms of supervision in social work is required. 80 References.

Culturally Specific Causes of Delinquency: Implications for Juvenile Justice in Hong Kong

Author: Wong, Dennis S W

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61642573?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on a review of Western research & personal experience in social work, an integrated interactional model is constructed to identify culturally specific causes of delinquency in Hong Kong. Results of 33 in-depth interviews with delinquents & nondelinquents suggest that reintegrative shaming practices, spirit of brotherhood, & an interdependent social environment are crucial factors pulling or pushing youngsters into or out of delinquency. Appropriate ways to reintegrate offenders into society in a Chinese cultural context are discussed, & a restorative justice approach is advocated for the better development of juvenile justice in Hong Kong. 1 Figure, 32 References.

In Defence of Long-Arm Practice Teaching

Author: Bridge, Gillian11 Dept Social Policy, London School Economics & Political Science, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61493698?accountid=14925

Abstract: Long-arm practice teaching has been developed in the UK as a strategy to create practice placements for DipSW students. It has also been seen as an unfortunate emergency arrangement. There has been little substantive research to evaluate this teaching method. This paper, based on the author's experience of supervising four students in this way, argues that with careful planning & anticipation of difficulties, long-arm practice teaching may be considered to be an acceptable alternative model rather than a regrettable aberration. 29 References.

Confidentiality, Client Autonomy and Students' Use of Case Material

Author: Quinn, Ann1; Burns, Keith1 Dept Professional Education Community Studies, U Reading, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61483772?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work students frequently use confidential information obtained from clients for their own educational purposes. This raises ethical issues that are relatively unexplored. We believe that students have a duty to uphold the confidentiality of client information, & that current procedures are often inadequate. Anonymizing identity may not be sufficient to preserve confidentiality, when a client has not consented to the use of case material for educational purposes. Equally, in situations where reflection on practice is particularly important, such as with unwilling clients or failed interventions, consent may be unobtainable. We argue that a reflective morality coupled with a respect for client autonomy is more appropriate to resolving such dilemmas. Such an ethical stance can also help students address the inequality of power within the professional relationship. 14 References. Adapted from the source document.

Towards the Development of Anti-Oppressive Reflective Practice: The Challenge for Multi-Disciplinary Working

Author: Issitt, Mary11 Dept Humanities & Applied Social Studies, Manchester Metropolitan U, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61630615?accountid=14925

Abstract: Considers the current policy context that presents collaborative working as a strategy for tackling social exclusion. Proposed is an approach informed by recent research that fuses antioppressive & reflective practice. The approach is presented as a possible starting point for consideration & action by practice teachers & other professionals involved in a "duty of partnership for health & social care.". 1 Figure, 37 References.

Reflections in the Pool: An Evaluation of a Long-Arm Practice Teaching Strategy for Social Work Placements

Author: Moss, Bernard11 Instit Social Work & Applied Social Studies, Staffordshire U, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525479?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper is based on a small evaluation study on the effectiveness of the long-arm practice teaching model for DipSW students. Staffordshire U has developed a pool of experienced long-arm practice teachers that enables them to provide placements in a wide range of settings. This article describes how the pool was established, & goes on to discuss its effectiveness, through the responses of the long-arm practice teacher, the job supervisors, & the students involved. It concludes with some recommendations for good practice. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Challenges for the Role of Mentoring in Promoting Reflective Practice

Author: Smith, Pauline11 Instit Education, Crewe, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61653775?accountid=14925

Abstract: Personal experience in British schools is drawn on to examine the skills & processes of mentoring & to identify issues for discussion that are more widely transferable to other occupational areas, eg, health & social work. The thrust of the argument is that schools, as learning organizations, should be able to build on the investment made in work-based mentoring, particularly in relation to the initial & induction phases of teacher development, to promote the culture of reflective practice across the whole organization & beyond. However, the present political & funding context is not fully supportive of more continuous mentor development, & the lack of quality time available for the mentoring process appears to dominate the educational workplace. 26 References.

Providing Social Work Field Education: Attributes for the Job: A Research Report from New Zealand

Author: Maidment, Jane11 School Social Enquiry, Faculty Arts, Deakin U, Geelong, Victoria, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525538?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports the findings of research conducted in New Zealand during 1996 on field educator attributes that enhance clinical education for social work students during placement. Students were polled immediately before their first placement began (N = 78), & immediately after their first placement concluded (N = 73), to ascertain opinion on what attributes were "most important" for a field educator to demonstrate. Field educators (N = 123) were polled during the placement using the same instrument. Student & field educator responses have been compared. Data analysis yielded two main results. Field educator training influenced attribute selection; neither students nor field educators selected attributes specifically related to social work practice as being "most important.". 3 Tables, 41 References.

Evaluation: A Faculty Member's Perspective on Continuing Education Programs

Author: Milner, Lois11 School Social Administration, Temple U, Philadelphia, PA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467263?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the evaluation of programs & practices of continuing education programs from an academic perspective. Also considered is how continuing education maintains & develops practitioner evaluation skills in an age of rapid technological advance. Historical & current approaches to evaluation research are briefly delineated in terms of the pursuit for desirable research paradigms & the impact on furthering empirical knowledge by limiting published works to those that adhere to traditional models. Continuing education is essential in enabling practitioners to provide the best possible interventions by facilitating evaluation research via providing insight into the relative merits of research tools, methods, & models apace with current technological change. 8 References.

The Role of the Site Coordinator in a Social Work Distance Education Program

Author: Hagan, Christine B1; Wilson, Ginger K; Potts, Marilyn K; Wheeler, Donna; Bess, Gary1 Dept Social Work, California State U, Long Beach

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61463553?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors describe the role of the site coordinator in a social work distance education program. The 3-year part-time MSW program links rural off-campus sites to a host urban university campus, using interactive TV. Site coordinators serve as teaching assistants, field placement coordinators, academic advisors, & community liaisons. Additionally, the site coordinator provides an administrative link to the host campus, serves as an advocate for students, & provides socialization of students to the values of the social work profession.

Mentoring and Organizational Learning

Author: Kelly, Michael J1; Lauderdale, Michael L1 School Social Work, U Missouri, Columbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61507268?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article describes a multi-year collaborative project, Mentor +, between a university extension program & a state human service agency that was designed to address the need for skilled leadership in social service agencies in today's sociopolitical environment. The project was founded on two hypotheses: (1) Formal mentoring would be a new management development method that would help senior managers develop mid-level managers. (2) A university, as an entity specializing in learning & development, could serve as a unique catalyst for the development of organizational learning. The authors discuss the findings, which suggest that supported formal mentoring is an attractive management strategy for public human service agencies. 3 Tables, 43 References.

Author: Scannapieco, Maria11 School Social Work, U Texas, Arlington

Abstract: The article provides background, implementation, & follow-up of the Texas Dept of Protective & Regulatory Services' efforts, in collaboration with the Children's Protective Services Training Instit, to expand training & certification for child welfare supervisors.

Freedoms and Unfreedoms as Issues in Social Welfare: Planning and Practice

Author: Sharma, Satish11 School Social Work, U Nevada, Las Vegas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663500?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores freedoms & unfreedoms as applied to individuals, families, organizations, communities, nations, & the global world in the contexts of social welfare planning & practice. Social welfare is conceived in general & specific terms, & classical & contemporary sociological & social welfare perspectives are utilized. Findings reveal that the human condition is in peril, & unfreedoms presently outweigh freedoms all over the world. This condition undermines human dignity, & social welfare planning & practice need to address unfreedom issues. 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

Millennium Talk and the Future of Social Work

Author: Forster, Michael11 U Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61650806?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is argued that social work should avoid popular "millennium talk" for three overlapping reasons: (1) such talk is tied to ideological confusions with elitist, violent, & apocalyptic elements; (2) social work's nonideological commitments to pragmatism, common sense, history as human made, & the open society depart radically from millennial consciousness; & (3) the future of social work lies with a fundamental recall & reaffirmation of its historically grounded commitments, not with a leap into a new age. 48 References.

Social Work: A Profession in Search of a Paradigm

Author: Soifer, Steven11 School Social Work, U Maryland, Baltimore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663535?accountid=14925

Abstract: Entering its second century as a profession, social work is still grappling with its identity. It is contended that social work has no guiding paradigm, & hence is left to the vagaries of 100+ different approaches, frameworks, models, perspectives, & theories, most of them emanating from the social sciences. Here, conceptual terms are clarified, & the profession's philosophy & epistemology are given a brief historical overview. A social work classification system is also devised. 75 References.

Toward a Common Paradigmatic Home: Social Work in the Twenty-First Century

Author: Ramsay, R F11 Faculty Social Work, U Calgary, Alberta

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663576?accountid=14925

Abstract: After summarizing the evolution of the modern science paradigm & the machine metaphor, the social work profession's links to this paradigm are discussed. Social work needs to integrate its diverse roots & transform to the paradigm of postmodern science & the Gaia metaphor & embrace a living systems paradigm or risk becoming increasingly outdated in the new millennium. 24 References.

The Future of Social Work: A Revision and a Vision

Author: Tsui, Ming-sum1; Chan, Raymond K H1 Dept Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61650846?accountid=14925

Abstract: Revisits the social work of the 20th century & outlines alternatives for the 21st in terms of three aspects: (1) the origins & nature of social work, (2) the alienation of social work from its mission in the process of development, & (3) the challenges of globalization & postmodernism. It is argued that the roots of social work are values. Social work of the 20th century, as a product of modernity, was dominated by science & rationality. In its "second century," social work will tend to be more of an international, culturally sensitive, personal, moral, & affective practice. Humanities, instead of social sciences, will become the major knowledge base. The profile of a social worker in the next century will be a person who helps with head, heart, & hands. 34 References.

Social Work Values: Self-Analysis Needed for the Twenty-First Century

Author: Tyler, Wade M11 Northwestern State U, Natchitoches, LA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61642154?accountid=14925

Abstract: Though social work claims to be a value-driven profession, it has not engaged in critical self-analysis relative to its values. Now is the time for such a self-analysis, as it stands poised on the brink of the 21st century. Here, the needed foundation is laid, & several questions are raised concerning core & universal values that are especially relevant to an international audience. 98 References.

Author: Srivastava, S P11 Dept Social Work, Lucknow U, Uttar Pradesh, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61639318?accountid=14925

Abstract: An overview of the past & future of social work in India. Weak spots in social work education & practice are identified, discussing (1) the persistent burden of Americanism; (2) the obsolescence of teaching methods, practicum, reading material, & course curricula; (3) the proliferation of schools/departments of social works; (4) the large number of indifferently trained graduate students; (5) the marginalized status of the profession; (6) the loss of the profession's traditional battle grounds; (7) fierce competition faced by social work graduates in the job-market; (8) weak & ineffectual performance of professional bodies; & (9) the lessening of people's faith in the competence of professional social workers. Some suggestions are offered for revamping & reorganizing the profession's frontiers to overcome stagnation. 34 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: There have been noteworthy paradigm shifts in social development in India. Initially, the government was primarily concerned with promoting economic development & voluntary organizations with the welfare of the needy & social reforms. Today, people's organizations are promoting integrated development & empowerment with considerations of social justice, highlighting consciousness-raising, organizing, & mobilization. 8 References.

Toward a Synthesis of International Social Development

Author: Lusk, Mark W1; Horejsi, Charles1 U Montana, Missoula

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61617069?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social workers in developing nations face much different conditions than their counterparts in industrial economies. With few state resources, they have begun to develop innovative approaches to dealing with the enormous social & economic problems of their clientele. Moreover, social work in the developing world is setting aside its long-standing preoccupation with political ideology & has shifted to a paradigm effort to ameliorate poverty & social injustice. Conversely, social welfare in the developed economies has turned away from state entitlements & is in search of a new set of measures to combat the dislocations of advanced postindustrial society. There would seem to be room for accommodation & convergence between the two perspectives. 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work: The End or a New Beginning?

Author: Mohan, Brij11 Doctoral Programme, School Social Work, Louisiana State U, Baton Rouge

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61633008?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues against the "end of social work" thesis, seeking to reaffirm the ideals & practice of democracy, diversity, & social justice -- the main constructs that legitimize discursive practice, an alternative paradigm. The future of social work, it is contended, depends on the future of social justice. The millennium angst offers an opportunity to reflect on the deconstruction of social reality & developmental transformation. A therapeutic culture promotes professional dissonance, narcissism, & dysfunctionality. An alternative, Foucauldian-inspired epistemology is proposed. 36 References.

Feminist Social Work: An Expression of Universal Human Rights

Author: Dominelli, Lena

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61443282?accountid=14925

Abstract: Considers the development of feminist social work in the UK, focusing on how it has altered from being concerned with "women's issues" to being deemed an integral part of the social work curriculum. Moreover, the subject of its analysis & practice has shifted to how gendered relations in social work both privilege & problematize masculinity. At the same time, women have become a more differentiated category with the valuing of differences between women occupying center stage. Strengths & weaknesses of feminist social work are assessed. 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

Intervening for Gender Justice

Author: Dagar, Rainuka11 Instit Development & Communication, Chandigarh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444332?accountid=14925

Abstract: Efforts toward gender equality have exposed the unfavorable social status of women by spreading gender awareness, facilitating access, mobilizing support & resources, & contesting discrimination. The difference approach highlights heterogeneous forms & peculiarities that define women's placement. Rather than focusing on equal rights or particular needs to combat women's unfavorable conditions, gender ideology needs to be undermined, because equality targets universal values & difference targets particular needs with neither challenging the structure of dominance. 27 References.

Gender Awareness in Field Instruction

Author: Muzumdar, Kalindi S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444312?accountid=14925

Abstract: Draws on personal experience teaching at an Indian college of social work to argue that problems caused by prevalent gender discrimination necessitate the gender awareness training of social work students. Fieldwork, including field instruction, provides an excellent opportunity to enable students to be sensitive to gender issues. Hence, the concept of gender awareness should be woven into different areas of fieldwork, ie, selection of fieldwork agencies, task assignment to students, student teamwork, supervisory conferences, & student recordings. 3 References.

Reining Women's Sexuality through Law: Implications for Social Work Education

Author: Gangoli, Geetanjali1; Solanki, Gopika1 c/o Solanki -- Dept Family & Child Welfare Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444288?accountid=14925

Abstract: Challenges the assumption that Indian law is gender neutral in the context of a feminist social work agenda, focusing on the continuum of oppression & denial of rights to women under civil & criminal law, particularly with respect to how women's sexuality is controlled & constructed. Such an approach might lead social work students to question the neutrality of the law. 7 References. Adapted from the source document.

Marital Dynamics in Alcoholism: Implications for Gender Aware De-Addiction Management

Author: Stanley, Selwyn11 Dept Social Work Bishop Heber Coll, Tiruchirappalli India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444280?accountid=14925

Abstract: Compares marital dynamics between wives of alcoholics & nonalcoholics (total N = 300) in Tiruchirapalli, India, via scale data. Poor marital adjustment & higher conflict levels were seen in alcohol-complicated marriages. Further, these wives reported less marital satisfaction, cohesion, consensus, & affectional expression & a higher prevalence of violence & verbal aggression. Implications for social work intervention indicate the need for heightened gender sensitivity in de-addiction management. 2 Tables, 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Reports on a project in the village of Khajuron, India, to promote integrated development & encourage gender equality through the empowerment of women. Programs were aimed at health, nutrition, education, employment, & social security issues, as well as reducing intercaste differences. Gender discrimination in India is discussed, along with major problems in Khajuron, where women are generally illiterate, frequently abused, & deprived of adequate health care & economically gainful work. Political factionalism, predominance of the Muslim culture, & adherence to the caste system help exclude women from education & political/social involvement. A baseline survey was used to assess the perceived needs of the villagers & a large variety of programs were established that have improved women's health, economic & educational status, & social awareness. Problems encountered are discussed, along with the positive & negative implications of such intervention. 5 References. J. Lindroth

The Special Cell for Women and Children of the Mumbai Police Commissionerate

Author: [Unknown]

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444263?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the Special Cell for Women & Children formed in 1984 at the Office of the Commissioner of Police in Mumbai, India, to deal with violence against women by placing trained social workers in police stations. A long-term goal of the program was to broaden the scope of the law to change the unequal power balance between men & women. The roles of the police & social workers are discussed, along with the nature of the intervention from the initial police response to an act of violence, through counseling, education, & community involvement. Identification & elimination of violent behavior by men involved changing cultural & social beliefs about the role of women, & helping women to develop a positive self-image & become more assertive. Working with the police has helped to legitimize the work in the eyes of men who are learning that violence will not be tolerated. Insights gained in the 14 years of the program's operation are addressed, along with its limitations. J. Lindroth

Abstract: Reports on The Women's Interest Group (TWIG) of the International Assoc of Schools of Social Work that was launched in 1992 to combat the association's failure to address women's needs & agendas. Events leading up to TWIG's formation & its activities are described. Women Participating in Global Change, a compilation of 24 papers presented at the Women's Symposium in Jerusalem, Israel, published by TWIG in 1998, stresses the important role of social work in the social change process, highlighting the ascendancy of women in international social work research, practice, & education. Suggestions that came out of the symposium are described, along with the formation of a cross-cultural resource exchange of books, syllabi, & teaching materials. The Women's Interest News is a newsletter that focuses on mutual sharing & learning among social work educators interested in promoting gender issues. Specific items solicited by the editorial team for inclusion in the newsletter are noted. J. Lindroth

Abstract: Examines the relationships of demographic characteristics & social network with the subjective well-being of 554 old-old (mean age 77.0) in Hong Kong. Questionnaire data show significant gender differences in all measures of subjective well-being. Family network & interdependent support make greater contributions to the psychological well-being of the old-old than do friends. 5 Tables, 18 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Sharing of Roles between a Social Worker and Members of a Self-Help Group for Mental Ex-Patients in Australia

Author: Yip, Kam-Shing11 Hong Kong Polytechnic U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61488660?accountid=14925

Abstract: Reports a qualitative study on the collaboration of social workers & the members of GROW (a self-help group for current or former mental patients) in South Australia. Participant observation in 2 such groups revealed that professionally trained social workers collaborated well with members, as they had similar backgrounds & experiences. Also, the social workers' roles in running these groups were shared by group members who took up roles as initiators, facilitators, leaders, evaluators, organizers, & problem solvers. The strengths & weaknesses of this model for the rehabilitation of former mental patients & its implications for social work interventions are described. 4 Figures, 47 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Job Performance Model for Professional Social Workers

Author: Tsui, Ming-Sum11 Hong Kong Polytechnic U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61442119?accountid=14925

Abstract: Defining job performance as a social construct from different perspectives -- eg, standards, behavior, & process -- a comprehensive model is constructed to explain the multiple realities of the job performance of professional social workers. The different perspectives of job performance -- organizational performance, staff performance, & quality of service -- are examined, & the dynamic relationships among various factors behind these components identified. Supervision & professional development for social workers, goal setting & strategy formulation for human service organizations, & program evaluation for service delivery are proposed as guidelines for improving job performance of professional social workers. 2 Figures, 24 References. Adapted from the source document.

Adjustment to Illness for Medical Social Work Practice

Author: Ma, Joyce L C1; Boey, Kam Weng1 Chinese U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61488637?accountid=14925

Abstract: Contending that social work can be better assessed with the aid of a standardized instrument, an attempt is made to evaluate the reliability of four measures of adjustment: the anxiety & depression subscales of SCL-90, a measure of social maladjustment to illness, & patients' perceived health status. The evaluation is based on scale data collected from 35 cancer patients in a Hong Kong hospital suffering from neoplasm of the nasopharynx. Implications for oncology social work practice are discussed. 3 Tables, 27 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Use of Experimental Design in Social Work Evaluation

Author: Cheung, Yin-Bun11 Centre Population Studies, London

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61488607?accountid=14925

Abstract: The evaluation of social work practice is distinguished from most other research in that its purposes & treatment are different. Illustrated here is why experimentation does not often serve the purposes of social work evaluation. The conventional viewpoint that program evaluation has the same general design as an experiment in the natural science is refuted. 29 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Tiong, Tan Ngoh1; Lee, Alexander; Ow, Rosaleen; Liang, Ngiam Tee; Hong, Ong Teck; Mehta, Kalyani; Tan, Vicky; See, Chew Yee1 National U Singapore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61442111?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social support & its impact on community development are important issues in the daily lives of Singaporeans, yet little research has been done among this population, & it is doubtful that Western research frameworks would be applicable. Reported here is a project to develop appropriate scales to identify & measure social support in Singapore so that databases can be constructed for extensive research in this area, differentiating among the various segments of this multicultural society. Implications for social work practice & for strengthening the fabric of the population at both the societal & family levels are emphasized. 25 References. S. Stanton

An Indigenous Psycho-Educational Group for Chinese Bereaved Family Members

Author: Chan, Cecilia L W1; Chow, Amy Y M1 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61430040?accountid=14925

Abstract: Detrimental effects of bereavement on physical, mental, social, & psychological aspects of individuals can be found among bereaved Chinese. The authors have developed an indigenous practice model to work with bereaved family members among Chinese people in Hong Kong. The concept of bereavement was recast to include the idea that bereavement is a challenge that can aid in personal growth. Strategies were created to deal with the feelings of loss & separation positively. Programs in a "growth-oriented" psychosocial-educational group using multiple cognitive, behavioral, & spiritual strategies were introduced. Throughout the sessions, messages of "Letting Go," "Self-Love," "Forgiveness," & "Transformation" were embedded in the programs by culturally relevant terms & concepts. A pre- & post-group questionnaire as well as long interviews were used to evaluate the impact of the group on the participants. Participants of the bereavement groups showed significant improvements in somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, mood, self-acceptance, letting-go, & transformation. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 51 References.

Social Work with the Addictions -- Can the Profession Deliver?

Author: Ng, Ho-Yee11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61482550?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reviews management problems of drug addiction in Hong Kong. Given the lip service paid so far to social work input in the drug rehabilitation scene, an argument is made for an expansion of the role of social work. But it is contended that social work will only be relevant if addiction work is placed squarely within the totality of an individual's life functioning, the area of concern to social work. This would entail, however, a reconceptualization of addiction from that of the prevailing medical view, which sees it as a disease process, to that of seeing addiction as a cognitive choice. 33 References.

Author: Lau, Yuk-King11 Dept Social Work, Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484052?accountid=14925

Abstract: Divorce is a family issue & not only an individual concern; a family systems perspective is proposed as a more appropriate framework when working with postdivorce families. Here, described is an intervention model guided by the family systems perspective that was used to organize two multiple-family groups for postseparation & postdivorce families. The evaluation results of the two groups & their implications to the social work profession at clinical & macro levels are discussed. 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

Moral Values, Judgments, and Intentions of Youths in Hong Kong

Author: Chan, Wing-tai,1; Cheung, Chau-kiu; Lee, Tak-yan; Leung, Kwan-kwok; Liu, Suk-ching1 Dept Applied Social Studies, City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61471550?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data collected in 1997 via a survey of a stratified random sample of 1,500 youth (ages 15-24) & 1,000 children (ages 10-14) across Hong Kong (70% total response rate) are drawn on to explore their moral values & the relation of these to their moral & delinquent intentions. Significant relationships emerged between moral values, judgments, & intentions, though respondents (Rs) were generally ignorant or confused about the concept of morality. Significant gender differences were evident, as was the impact of associating with moralistic vs delinquent peers. Results demonstrate the centrality of moral values & peer relationships in moral judgments & intentions, supporting cognitive-developmental theory. 11 References. K. Hyatt Stewart

Author: Kanuha, Valli11 School Social Work, U Hawaii, Honolulu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61507168?accountid=14925

Abstract: Professional social work has both a distinguished & troubling history in the development of domestic violence policies & programs in the US & internationally. Over the last two decades, the evolution of a domestic violence service industry, with social workers as key practitioners, has highlighted the ongoing challenges of the feminist, activist roots of the battered women's movement & increased professionalization of domestic violence services. The author analyzes the role of social work in the domestic abuse field & provides implications for addressing some of the recurrent practice & ideological tensions. 61 References.

Grounded Training: Preparing Child Welfare Supervisors for Domestic Violence Work

Author: Fleck-Henderson, Ann1; Krug, Stefan1 School Social Work, Simmons Coll, Boston, MA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525728?accountid=14925

Abstract: "Grounded training" is an approach to staff development that draws on insights about adult learners & public service workers & that continuously involves trainees in curriculum development. As recipients of an innovative training grant from Health & Human Services, the authors of this article developed a training program for child welfare supervisors on working with families affected by domestic violence. Partners in the grant were Simmons Coll School of Social Work, Boston Medical Center, & the Massachusetts Dept of Social Services. A description of that project illustrates the grounded training approach. 2 Tables, 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Evolution of Professional Training in Accord with Pedagogical Change to Meet Growing Child and Family Needs

Author: Ross, Jean W1; Wright, Lois; Skipper, Anna V; Valentine, Deborah P1 Center Child & Family Studies, Coll Social Work, U South Carolina, Columbia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61463530?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since the 1960s, child maltreatment concerns have prompted federal funding for partnerships between social work schools & public welfare agencies to train professionals working with the escalating & increasingly complex problems facing children & families. Training models at the Center for Child & Family Studies at the U of South Carolina have evolved in several stages from traditional methodology, giving scant voice to trainees, to a facilitation model, with maximum participant input assuring accountability while meeting participants' self-articulated needs & objectives. In this evolution the Center's training has paralleled the pedagogical movement from "banking" to "midwife" methodology, incorporating constructivist changes from adult education, feminism, & postmodernism. 4 Tables, 22 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470650?accountid=14925

Abstract: It has been estimated that approximately one-third of all social workers in child welfare resign each year, which results in discontinuity of service for clients & is detrimental to worker morale. Long-term training programs have been implemented to improve the professionalism of child welfare service delivery & improve retention rates. The purpose of this study was to assess the retention outcomes of a long-term training program & examine the impact declassification of social work positions & the privatization of child welfare services has had on long-term child welfare training. 17 References.

Service Provider Knowledge, Misconceptions and Bias about Aging: A Case for Professional Development

Author: Singleton, Carole A11 Dept Social Work, U Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525784?accountid=14925

Abstract: Qualified providers of services to the elderly may be assumed to have realistic & factually based views of the objective circumstances of their clients. An assessment of social workers' baseline knowledge about aging suggests reason for concern about potential effects of provider misconceptions & biases on decision making impacting elderly users of a range of services available to this population. Study findings support the case for formal continuing education opportunities for service providers. 4 Tables, 31 References. Adapted from the source document.

Female Migration in India

Author: Singh, D P11 Dept Research Methodology Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61440757?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines migration patterns in India using 1961-1991 census data, with focus on migration level, reasons for migration by type of migration streams, & workforce participation rate & education level of migrants. Analysis indicates that the % of migrants to total enumerated population is consistently declining among both the male & the female population. Employment among males & marriage among females are the most dominant factors behind their movement, irrespective of the type or distance of movement. 5 Tables, 1 Figure, 21 References.

Costs and Benefits of Female Labour Migration

Author: Sundari, S1; Rukmani, M K1 Mother Teresa Women's U, Kodaikanal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61440749?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines the trend, causes, & pattern of female migration from Tamil Nadu to Delhi, India, 1951-1991, drawing on census data & interviews conducted with 250 migrant households. Findings suggest that the most important push factor was lack of employment opportunity & the pull factor was the continuous demand for the labor of women in Delhi for domestic work. Though the migrants have made some gains, problems such as housing, illiteracy, indebtedness, job insecurity, & school dropout among children demand immediate policy prescriptions & actions. 6 Tables, 2 Figures, 11 References.

Re-Examining the Resettlement Question in the Context of Migrant Women's Security and Urban Poverty in Bangladesh

Author: Afsar, Rita11 Bangladesh Instit Development Studies, Dhaka

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61440740?accountid=14925

Abstract: In response to the growth of shanties, slums, & squatter settlements, which is inextricably linked with rapid urbanization & the emergence of megacities in developing countries, resettlement measures have been implemented as part of poverty alleviation programs, particularly in Bangladesh. Draconian measures have been taken to remove the migrant poor from the center of the city, both by the government & vested interest groups with a view to taking control of the land. These measures are discussed here with focus on their implications for poor women, drawing on a review of Asian Development Bank findings, relevant survey data, rapid appraisal of selected bastis (settlements), interviews, & group meetings. It is argued that resettlement can neither resettle the poor nor reduce urban poverty, & moreover, has negative implications for poor women by threatening their security & job opportunities. To be meaningful, poverty reduction programs in urban areas must address the issues of women's security, identity, the protective umbrella of social networks, & work opportunities, & must involve poorer communities as partners while implementing housing & shelter programs. 5 Tables, 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

Incorporating Follow-Up to Evaluate the Impact of Continuing Professional Education Programs on Social Work Practice

Author: Dietz, Tracy J11 Dept Sociology/Social Work/Criminal Justice, Texas Christian U, Fort Worth

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61507518?accountid=14925

Abstract: In order for many social workers across the nation to maintain their licenses or certifications, they must participate in continuing professional education programs. With increasing pressure from funding sources & the public, there will be greater demands to demonstrate that these programs do indeed improve practice. The author discusses the three levels at which continuing education programs are evaluated & argues that evaluators need to place greater emphasis on evaluations that measure how well such programs improve practice. 20 References.

Author: Smith, Alice E11 School Social Work, West Chester U, PA

Providing Culturally Competent Juvenile Justice Services to the Latino Community

Author: Pabon, Edward11 Social Work Program, Richard Stockton Coll New Jersey, Pomona

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61526401?accountid=14925

Abstract: The interaction between traditional juvenile justice service providers & Latino youngsters & families in US society has been somewhat impersonal, structured, & formal, with minimal give-&-take questioning & relevant discussion. The resultant evidence continues to suggest that services have not been sufficiently responsive to the needs of minority clients, especially Latino youngsters. Juvenile justice providers need to understand & incorporate cultural value preferences, such as familialism, allocentrism, & personal distance, in their relationship with Latino clients in terms of building therapeutic contacts. 16 References.

The Link between International Migration and Development: Implications of the Situation in Sri Lanka

Author: Gamlath, Sarathchandra11 Dept Social Work & Social Policy La Trobe U, Bundoora Victoria 3083 Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448850?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores the link between migration & development in the Sri Lankan context, considering how the social work profession could assist in changing the outcome of poorer families' participation in contract labor migration. Two major roles are argued to be open to social work: (1) assist in changing the situation of distorted development, using methods well explored in the literature & experimented with in the field; & (2) contribute to these families' involvement in contract labor migration in ways that may well ensure that the migration-development relationship is rendered far more beneficial than is currently the situation. 26 References.

Abstract: Describes the remedial & preventive mental health care available in Singapore, focusing on how worldviews & other social-cultural factors influence the diagnosis & psychosocial treatment of the mentally ill. Certain behavioral concepts typical of the local population & significant in help-seeking therapy, especially in the area of family counseling & support, are included in a discussion on inpatient & community care. Effective delivery & usage of services are shown to be dependent on the ability to blend professional knowledge with the worldviews & cultural expectations of the service user. 31 References.

The "New Opium War": Welfare Dependency of Lone Mothers in Hong Kong?

Author: Leung, Lai Ching1; Chan, Kam Wah1 Dept Applied Social Studies, City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61482579?accountid=14925

Abstract: Welfare dependency is becoming a conspicuous problem in Hong Kong. Welfare claimants are accused of being overly dependent on welfare & lacking incentive to work. Welfare is even equated with "spiritual opium," that which erodes work incentive. Lone parents & the unemployed are among the groups blamed the most. This paper produces evidence, based on our research on lone mothers in Hong Kong, to refute the accusation of welfare dependency. The arguments that lone mothers are consciously maximizing their social security benefits & that they are better off on benefit, as postulated in rational choice theory, is fallacious. We should therefore try to understand the welfare dependency of lone mothers not by reference to an alleged "dependency culture," but rather through a more holistic appreciation of the interactions among a variety of structural forces such as discrimination in the labor market, gender inequality in marital relation, low wages, inadequate child care facilities, & the poverty traps within the social security system. 37 References.

Coping with Resettlement Difficulties: A Qualitative Analysis of Coping Strategies Used by Mainland Chinese Immigrants in Hong Kong

Author: Wong, Daniel Fu Keung11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484620?accountid=14925

Abstract: A qualitative study was undertaken to explore the coping strategies used by mainland Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong to handle psychosocial stressors experienced during the resettlement stage of the migration process. It was revealed that coping strategies employed were stage-specific & culture-specific. While problem-solving strategies & compromise were used by immigrants to deal with recurring, daily resettlement difficulties, cognitive strategies of positive comparisons & positive & optimistic thinking were utilized to change the meanings of these difficulties. Acceptance & avoidance strategies were culture-specific, & were useful in reducing the stress associated with the resettlement difficulties encountered. It was also found that strategies such as acceptance, compromise, & avoidance might have deleterious effects on the longer-term adjustment of immigrants. Implications for counseling the immigrants were suggested. 3 Tables, 39 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Development of the Student Worker in Field Practice Training

Author: Leung, Anna Y L11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61483949?accountid=14925

Abstract: Findings from a pilot study on the field practice experience of undergraduate social work students give support to the postulation that in field practice, students go through a developmental process with stages, through which they learn to master practice knowledge & skills, develop personal awareness & establish a professional identity. The stages are roughly identified as "looking for certainty," "chaos," & "finding one' place." In each stage, common patterns of trainee needs, characteristics, & emotional experiences are highlighted. Suggestions are made on how field instructors can provide the facilitating conditions for the students' learning & development through an understanding of these stages. 36 References.

Assessment of Family Functioning in Chinese Adolescents in Hong Kong

Author: Shek, Daniel T L1; Lai, Kelly; Lai, Angie F Y; Chan, L K1 Dept Social Work, Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin New Territories

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61471562?accountid=14925

Abstract: With the growing emphasis on the importance of enhancing family functioning when working with families, the demand for objective family assessment tools has increased. In addition, with the increase in family problems in different Chinese contexts, there is an obvious need to develop family assessment tools so that the relevant phenomena can be objectively understood & the related intervention can be properly evaluated. However, a survey of the literature shows that objective instruments that assess family functioning in Chinese adolescents are almost nonexistent. The present study was conducted to examine the psychometric properties of several translated measures of family functioning & an indigenous scale on family functioning. 1 Table.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61648009?accountid=14925

Abstract: Offers a preliminary account of the first phase of an ongoing Scotland-wide study examining why & in what circumstances placements on social work programs are unsuccessful or uncompleted. The study's background, aims, & methods are described, & emerging issues identified. Data collection, which is ongoing, is based on interviews with students, practice teachers, tutors, & link workers (term adopted to describe the person who supervises the day-to-day practice of the student, where the practice teacher is based elsewhere). A total of 43 interviews had been conducted with 39 respondents regarding 18 placements. The perceptions & experiences of study participants & ways of more effectively managing unsuccessful or uncompleted placements will be explored, deriving recommendations for good practice. 14 References.

Disabled Students: Barriers to Practice Learning

Author: Phillips, Rena11 Dept of Applied Social Science, U of Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61648056?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores the perceptions & experiences of disabled social work students in institutions & placements, based on interviews with 8 students, 7 course tutors, & 8 practice teachers. Barriers to training were identified in five main areas: the disabling environment; problems of typification, whereby global assumptions of impairment are made about individuals; the failure of equal opportunities policies; the practice of treating all students in the same way; & self-censorship on the part of students. It is argued that the reluctance of some students to declare an impairment is a rational response to the disabling policies pursued, albeit inadvertently, by institutions & agencies. Themes are identified & action points suggested to provide a more accessible educational & practice environment for disabled students. 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

Creativity and Competence: Reconstructing Social Work for the Millennium

Author: Knight, Theo1; Worsley, Aidan1 Staff Development Section, Rm 95, Stockport Social Services, Lisburne Lane, Offerton, Stockport SK2 7LL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61647108?accountid=14925

Abstract: Criticizes recent discourses on social work & suggests an alternative paradigm for the new millennium. The recent history of social work is dominated by a managerialist discourse emanating from Thatcherism, containing certain views about realism & value for money that restrict creative thinking. The competency frameworks developed in GB by CCETSW may be seen as examples of this discourse. The discourse arising from academia challenges the value of such competency frameworks because of their narrow view of social work. Academia is criticized for its role in creating social workers as experts, which distances them from the experiences of users. A view of the competency frameworks is presented that suggests how they can be used creatively. However, so long as social work continues to be defined by managers or academics, real change will be difficult to achieve. It is shown how the competency frameworks can be used to address user involvement, & thus create a third paradigm for defining social work. 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

Changes to the DipSW: One Step Forward, Three Steps Back

Author: Barraclough, John11 North London Practice Teaching Consortium, Islington Neighborhood Services, 292, Essex Rd, London, N1 3AZ

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61629910?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that CCETSW revisions to the CQSW (Certificate of Qualification in Social Work) -- providing an overhaul of professional social work training qualifications in GB -- specifically, Paper 30 & 26.3, resulting in the Assured Quality documents, have been detrimental. It is argued that three fundamental areas of practice training are adversely affected: antioppressive practice, direct observation of student's practice, & the integration of theory & practice. It is contended that the changes have resulted in social workers' improper understanding of the theories underpinning social work in the same way that the prior CQSW courses produced theoretically illiterate practitioners.

The Use of Business Planning in Practice Teaching

Author: Peddar, Jenny11 Learning Centre, Cugle House, 118a High St, Newport, Isle of Wight PO30 1TP

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61656850?accountid=14925

Abstract: Following local government reform & restructuring within the Isle of Wight (England) Social Services Dept, & in line with a corporate move toward the use of business planning within the agency, a decision was made in 1996 to develop a business plan for practice teaching. This move was undertaken by the group of practice teachers established by the department in 1990, which follows policies & a code of practice aimed at achieving & maintaining high standards of practice. The initial plan has now been in operation for just over a year & is due for updating. The outcomes have included a more businesslike manner for the service provided both within the agency & for partnerships. New areas have been highlighted, notably finance & resource maximization. Existing good practice areas became apparent & have been incorporated, with regular proactive updating systems. Achievable & measurable targets have been set for the improvement & maintenance of practice standards.

Learning and Practising or Just Saying the Words? Anti-Discriminatory Issues in Social Work Training

Author: Trotter, Joy11 School Health, U of Teesside, Middlesbrough, TS1 3BA, England

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61636439?accountid=14925

Abstract: Content analysis of 128 placement reports written by final-year (1993/94) CQSW (Certificate of Qualification in Social Work) & DipSW (Diploma in Social Work) students & practice teachers in GB are used to explore consideration & appreciation of antidiscriminatory practice issues. Preparation for practice, definitions of terms, & acceptability of focus are discussed. Results reveal that CQSW students & practice teachers displayed a considerable awareness of gender issues & that DipSW students & practice teachers displayed a considerable awareness of race issues & antidiscriminatory practice generally. The majority of students failed to deal with more than one area of discrimination, & very few referred to issues of class, religion, culture, or sexuality. The failure to recognize heterosexism & homophobia is discussed in some detail. Despite the frequency of allusions to antiracism, antisexism, & antidiscriminatory practice, students demonstrated poor understanding, awareness, & skill in these areas. It is concluded that gaps in resources, personal fears, & obsequious leadership combine to prevent students from learning & practicing in antidiscriminatory ways. 5 Figures, 47 References.

Social Work Training within the Voluntary Sector

Author: Justice, Mark11 Lookahead Housing Assoc Ltd, Whitechapel Project, 17 Varden Rd, London E2 2AW

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61652998?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the provision of social work student placements in a voluntary setting in Tower Hamlets, a deprived London (England) borough. The practice teacher uses action research as a placement tool, which enables him/her to practice teach three students at any one time & ensures that the practice curriculum is met. It is argued that the benefits of this approach accrue both to the students & the organization. Adapted from the source document.

Developing a Conceptual Framework for Teaching and Assessing Law within Training for Professional Practice: Lessons from Social Work

Author: Preston-Shoot, Michael1; Roberts, Gwyneth; Vernon, Stuart1 School of Law, Social Work & Social Policy, John Moores U, Josephine Butler House, 1 Myrtle St, Liverpool L7 4DN

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61647060?accountid=14925

Abstract: Uses a case study illustration of an elderly women with senile dementia to describe the development of a conceptual framework for teaching & assessing social work law. This framework begins with a distinction within social work law between the relevant legal rules, their relationship with professional values, & the context of administrative law. It then focuses on the interactions between law & practice, & on the skills necessary for competence. Research that highlights the difficulties experienced by practice teachers in providing appropriate learning opportunities is reviewed. These difficulties are addressed by a careful distinction between interim & final competence, the introduction of particular teaching & learning methods, attention to partnership between the different stakeholders in social work education, & the development of a post-qualifying program. It is suggested that this model might also be useful for other health & welfare professions. 21 References. Adapted from the source document.

Cultural and Linguistic Sensitivity in Practice Teaching

Author: Evans, Jacquie11 North East Wales Instit of Higher Education, Plas Coch, Mold Rd, Wrexham, Clwyd LL11 2AW, Wales

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61608815?accountid=14925

Abstract: Addresses the importance of cultural & linguistic sensitivity in social work practice teaching. It is argued that students need to have a practical as well as a theoretical awareness of the importance of cultural & linguistic dimensions of working with clients in localized communities. Greater awareness on the part of practice teachers of these issues in the development of their social work students is urged. 4 References. Adapted from the source document.

Perspectives on Welfare Reform Part One: Social Work -- Welfare and Work: Some Suggestions on How the Two Can Mesh, from a Public Policy Administrator

Author: Florey, David C11 Bureau Employment & Training Programs, Office Income Maintenance, Pennsylvania Dept Welfare, Harrisburg

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61439407?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social workers & public administrators must find common ground in revising the current welfare system in the US. In the past, the general view was that people were on welfare because they could not navigate postmodern society on their own. Recently, the common viewpoint is that many people are on welfare because it is there. There is some movement to put limits on the length of time that welfare services are available, & there is a strong push toward welfare recipients entering the job market as exemplified by recent changes in PA welfare law. The goal is to put able people to work & on the path to supporting themselves & their families. It is argued that public welfare administrators realign their attitudes toward case management so that social work's holistic approach becomes the ideal instead of the benefit-generating caseload management that characterized the pre-reform welfare system.

Author: Beresin, Constance Goldman11 Jewish Employment & Vocational Service, Philadelphia, PA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467367?accountid=14925

Abstract: PA is pioneering some new laws concerning the need for welfare recipients to go to work. At present, there is a five-year lifetime limit on federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)-funded assistance. This article explores how employment & training providers are affected. It details four areas where organizations & social workers are impacted & implications for continuing education of social workers: financial management; marketing; communication; & information technology. Social workers must keep current on all the changes. E. Larsen

Social Work and Managed Behavioral Health Care: We Don't Want to Be Your Darlings Anymore

Author: Angell, G Brent1; Rohrer, Glenn E1 School Social Work, East Carolina U, Greenville, NC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61507207?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social work is a profession under moral & ethical siege as a result of its favored position with respect to the delivery of fee-for-service mental & behavioral health services under managed care. The authors look at how social workers, in becoming the "darlings" of managed behavioral health care, have compromised their professional autonomy & their ability to advocate in the best interest of consumers of mental & behavioral health services. The authors call for a professional identity check-up & suggest alternative approaches to practice within managed behavioral health care that have ramifications for teaching & continuing education. 70 References. Adapted from the source document.

Psychopharmacology Knowledge and Use with Social Work Professionals: A Continuing Education Evaluation

Author: Dziegielewski, Sophia F1; Leon, Ana M1 School Social Work, U Central Florida, Orlando

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61439411?accountid=14925

Abstract: This continuing education program was designed to increase social worker knowledge in regard to mental health medications in the practice setting. This full-day workshop presented the basics of medication use & the effects these medications can have on the counseling environment. The intention of the workshop was to explore the knowledge level social workers possess & how comfortable they feel in relationship with other professionals when it comes to the use of medications. One hundred & sixty-nine participants were surveyed, resulting in approximately 137 usable surveys that addressed general knowledge of medications as well as pretested/posttested responses in regard to whether they felt the workshop was helpful in increasing their current levels of understanding & impressions in regard to medication use. Significant relationships were noted between several study variables as well as between pretest & posttest scores. Suggestions for future research & education in this area are presented. 1 Table, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Interfacing with Managed Behavior Health Care Organizations: An Emerging Scale of Private Practitioner's Self-Perceived Competence

Author: Keefe, Robert H1; Hall, Michael L1 School Social Work, Syracuse U, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467980?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Wagner & Morse Measure of Individual Sense of Competence was revised & administered to 168 social workers, 158 psychologists, & 256 psychiatrists in private practice. The scale measured the practitioners' ability to interface with managed care organizations. Although seasoned private practitioners were sampled, they indicated that they do not perceive themselves as competent in their interactions with managed care organizations. These conclusions have pronounced implications for the practitioners' ability to advocate strongly for their clients & for continuing education programs to focus on the interface between managed care organizations & private practitioners. 2 Figures, 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467996?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors explore issues impacting the entry of social workers into management roles within the human services. While historically there has been a bias toward developing social workers for direct practice roles, there is an increasing need for social workers to be prepared for supervision & management. The authors present findings of a national study identifying management competencies for human services, & discuss a continuing education human services management program for graduate social work practitioners. 1 Table, 2 Figures, 21 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444926?accountid=14925

Abstract: In an introduction to this special journal issue, an overview of social sciences theorizing on movements is presented, with attention to the debates on new social movements & nonparty political formations in India. Examined is how contemporary struggles have redefined classical notions of power, oppression, & liberation. Also explored is how these struggles grapple with difference, & how they strategize their relationship to the state, development, & the realm of the cultural & the symbolic. The need for a coming together of struggles & movements on broad agendas is addressed. 48 References. Adapted from the source document.

Development and Marginalisation: Global and National Scenario

Author: Kurien, C T11 Madras Instit Development Studies, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445671?accountid=14925

Abstract: Illustrates how economic growth has been jobless, ruthless, voiceless, rootless, & futureless under the institutional arrangements of capitalism; further, it is flawed by the inner contradiction that marginalization or exclusion of some people is accompanied by the enrichment of others. In contrast to the conflict between capital & people in the current development paradigm, an alternative paradigm of development is recommended in which people use capital for the achievement of their defined objectives. A precondition for the success of this approach is people's awareness of their rights & of their power to bring the development process under their collective control. 3 References.

Marginalised Indian Humanity: Do the Bells of the Constitution Toll for Them?

Author: Iyer, V R Krishna

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445663?accountid=14925

Abstract: Critiques the present-day development of India's justice system. The insensitive response of the system to Dalits & other Scheduled Castes & Tribes, resulting in continuing atrocities & a sham of affirmative action, is discussed. Other so-called progressive & protective legislation remains largely on paper. The various national commissions are also unable to effectively redress injustice. The potential of public interest litigation & the possibility of the court becoming a catalyst of social justice are considered. Adapted from the source document.

The People versus the System

Author: Sharma, B D11 Bharat Jan Andolan, New Delhi India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445656?accountid=14925

Abstract: Presents a historical analysis of people vs the political economy, from the dawn of civilization through the great industrial revolution & colonization, to contemporary globalization. Three broad situations are discussed: the world of victors, the world of the vanquished, & the intermediate zone. Two genres of reaction to the malfunctioning of the system are identified: violent revolts against the state & resistance of the infolding of the logic of the system & the imperial paradigm. It is argued that the movement of village self-governance in the tribal areas has the potential of graduating into a pan-Indian people's movement, which may force a basic structural transformation. Adapted from the source document.

The Plight of Dalits: A Challenge to the Social Work Profession

Author: Ramaiah, A11 Unit Social Policy & Social Welfare Administration Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai 400088 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445636?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that the social work profession has yet to extend its formal professional support to the Dalits (Scheduled Castes) in India. It is suggested that appropriate methods & new techniques are needed to help both the teachers & the students of social work to overcome their caste prejudices before they are entrusted with the task of annihilating the caste system & ameliorating the lot of the Dalits. 22 References.

The Labour Movement in India: Present Problems and Future Perspectives

Author: Bhowmik, Sharit K11 Dept Sociology U Bombay, Mumbai India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445627?accountid=14925

Abstract: Describes the labor force in India, noting the main features of the trade union movement since independence. Problems facing the working class, especially in the present period of structural adjustment & globalization, are discussed. It is argued that proliferation of trade unions has weakened the working-class movement in India & that, along with trade union unity, there is a need for closer links between labor in the organized & the unorganized sectors. 16 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445620?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the women's movement in India & its relationship to the state, exploring this relationship in terms of the continuously contested boundaries of private & public realms in the social structure. The multiple identities of the women's movement & the commonalities & specificities of women's experiences that confound the analysis & action of the women's movement are examined, noting challenges to the movement in a scenario where the locus of control seems to be shifting from the state to the supra state. 69 References.

Author: Jandhyala, Kameshwari11 National Project Office Mahila Samakhya, New Delhi India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445609?accountid=14925

Abstract: Addresses the place of the empowerment of women on the official agenda of the Indian state, with focus on the experience of the Mahila Samakhya program, a centrally sponsored program with the explicit agenda of women's education & empowerment, primarily in Andhra Pradesh. Described is how this program has attempted to create the same space & opportunity for growth & empowerment of women in the organization as for the rural women it works with. The program's strategy of enabling women to raise questions about problems, consider various ways of dealing with them, & acting on them has resulted in a wide array of issues being addressed, through the structure of sanghams, or collectives. 7 References.

Contemporary Struggles of the Tribal Peoples of India

Author: Pathy, Jaganath11 South Gujarat U, Surat India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445598?accountid=14925

Abstract: Critically examines the available literature on tribal movements, suggesting that exploitation of tribals is premised on the epistemology of individualism, which has destroyed their survival base; statist ideology & the nation-building process, which threaten their linguistic & cultural survival; & capitalist paradigm of development, which has expropriated natural resources. In this context, the state has emerged as the chief enemy of tribal people. Here, a case is made for the right of internal self-determination for tribal regions in the state system. The alternative development paradigm would involve struggles against imperialism & domestic reactionary forces, toward the emergence of multiple coexisting civilizations. 12 References.

Tribal Movements: Resistance to Resurgence

Author: Prabhu, Pradeep11 Kashtakari Sanghatana, Dahanu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445591?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores the terms of discourse of present tribal movements in India, focusing on the emergence of new leftist formations. The new realms of action articulated by these movements include a reaffirmation of identity, struggle to recapture control over resources, rethinking of the political domain, & redefinition of development. The notions of development, nation building, & human (individual) rights have been the prime factors in the progressive destruction of the survival systems of tribal peoples. The emerging perspectives in tribal movements signal a shift from resistance to resurgence, toward ethnodevelopment. 54 References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Context and Community Perception of HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care among IDUs and Their Communities

Author: Thomas, Joe11 Community Research AIDS Centre Clinical Trials & Epidemiological Research Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin New Territories

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61447984?accountid=14925

Abstract: Draws on a broad array of quantitative & qualitative analyses to assess the current preintervention situation of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) awareness & prevention among injecting drug users in Manipur, India. Results show a rapid spread of HIV among users in several districts across the state. Interviews conducted in 1994 with 45+ church, ethnic association, & tribal leaders, as well as representatives of law enforcement & the military, reveal a complex range of social conflicts concerning the epidemic, preventing any single type of prevention program to serve as an all-inclusive solution. Policy & program suggestions include the dire need for the state & society to perceive the socially marginalized life of those infected with the virus as a human rights issue; discouragement of discrimination through community action; & avoidance of legal avenues, detention, & punishment as means of deterrent. 25 References.

Violence against Women, with Reference to 498 A and 304 B, Indian Penal Code

Author: Gandhi, Anjali11 Dept Social Work Jamia Milia Islamia, New Delhi India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61447981?accountid=14925

Abstract: Reviews current theories on why women continue to stay with abusive husbands, drawing on three case studies of working-class marriages in New Delhi, India. Three theoretical models explaining gender-based violence are briefly outlined: (1) the interpersonal perspective, maintaining that the source of the violence lies in the abnormal psychological relationship; (2) the sociocultural view that abuse is largely a response to adverse socioeconomic conditions; & (3) the feminist perspective, holding that abuse extends from the perpetuation of patriarchy. The cases of the 3 New Dehli women illustrate the psychological entrapment, learned helplessness, & reasoned action involved in the abusive relationship, along with the women's means of escape & support. India's 1983 & 1986 penal code additions (498A & 304B) are discussed in terms of the country's attempts to recognize & rectify the long-suppressed problem. 29 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61447965?accountid=14925

Abstract: Describes a government-supported community development project in Maharashtra, India, to improve the supply & quality of drinking water. The social, structural, & managerial challenges of the 1991 program are analyzed, along with the overall aims of incorporating community involvement in all levels of design & construction. Training programs are outlined for state, district, & village personnel. Particular attention is paid to the gender strategies of the project, because the arduous task of water gathering has traditionally been designated as women's work by Indian society. Efforts taken to assure women's participation & approval are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Cox, David1; Gamlath, Sarathchandra; Pawar, Manohar1 La Trobe U, Bundoora Victoria 3083 Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448779?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that the extent of poverty in South Asia is completely unacceptable, its alleviation demands a major concerted effort, & social work has both the potential & the responsibility to contribute to that task. For that to occur, however, significant changes will be necessary in social work education throughout the subcontinent. The discussion focuses on the situation of Bangladesh, India, & Sri Lanka. 11 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Development of Services for the Elderly in Singapore: An Asian Model

Author: Mehta, Kalyani11 Dept Social Work & Psychology National U Singapore, 0511 Singapore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448771?accountid=14925

Abstract: Analyzes the evolution of services for the elderly in Singapore, illustrating the interface of historical circumstances, demography, & government policy. It is noted that, from a wholly welfare-oriented approach, the trend has been toward a more balanced developmental-cum-welfare approach since 1970. The necessity of initiating a centralized national council on aging to provide an integrated range of services for the fast-growing Singaporean elderly population is highlighted. 10 References.

Teenage Drugs Subculture: Implications for Preventive Strategies in Social Work Practice

Author: Lai, Kwok-Hung11 Technical Instit Vocational Training Council, Dept Sociology, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61471522?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rapid social change due to emigration & the development of new towns has weakened parental bonds & the social support networks of families & clans. These changes may lead to an immense increase in teenage drug abuse & suicide. The drug dependence of teenagers is not simply a result of curiosity, but a reflection of stress management in the form of escape from reality. This paper gives an account of the stages of adolescent drug dependence, & the levels of intervention where social work practitioners can play a more active role in drug prevention. Strategies related to primary, secondary, & tertiary prevention are discussed. 1 Table, 81 References. Adapted from the source document.

The "Night Drifting Teens" -- A Quest for Social Work

Author: Lee, Francis11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration, U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61511185?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Hong Kong, the phenomenon of young people hanging around individually or in groups in public places throughout the night has become prevalent. This has drawn much attention from the public & the media because the behavior of these "night drifting teens" (eg, chasing around, vandalizing, harassing people passing by, behaving promiscuously) is becoming a public nuisance. Moreover, they also risk running up against the law. Based on a recent exploratory study of "night drifting" youths, this paper introduces their social background & situation. The causes of their engagement in these nocturnal activities are also explored. Services for this group of youths are proposed, & recommendations for the direction & development of relevant service programs to meet their needs are suggested. 7 Tables, 1 Figure, 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

School Social Work in Hong Kong -- Task Analysis and Its Implications for Future Development

Author: Liu, Elaine Suk-Ching11 Dept Applied Social Studies, City U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61471536?accountid=14925

Abstract: Task analysis is applied to school social work in Hong Kong to examine, first, how school social workers conceptualize the functions & ideologies of their work. Secondly, it argues how they can better meet the needs of the students & the community. Research results indicate an inclination for local practice to move toward a clinical model with less emphasis on a systems change approach. The implications for future practice are also discussed. 2 Tables, 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Conception of Learning among Social Work Students

Author: Tsang, Nai-Ming11 Dept Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61483883?accountid=14925

Abstract: The responses of 723 students & graduates from the social work course in the Dept of Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U, to 30 statements on the conception of learning are examined. A factor analysis reveals five underlying dimensions: learning as perception; learning as a dynamic process that transcends time & space; the significant others in learning; the instrumental functions of learning; & learning as a rational & emotive process. Nonparametric tests reveal significant differences between (1) those with & without social work experience & (2) those with or without a diploma. Findings of second-order tests of significance are discussed also. 7 Tables, 2 Appendixes, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring the Parenting Difficulties of Stepmothers in Hong Kong: Implications for Social Workers and Teachers

Author: Lam, Gladys L T11 Dept Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61483903?accountid=14925

Abstract: The number of divorce cases in Hong Kong has soared in recent years, & the stepfamily is an emerging family structure. This exploratory study is aimed at examining difficulties of parenting in stepfamilies through interviews with stepmothers, social workers, & teachers. Reports of these stepmothers reveal that they feel overloaded in the stepfamilies & that their spouses do not give them enough support. They complain that their in-laws & relatives create stress rather than offer help in child management. The findings indicated that there are difficulties in communication between the couples, problems between stepmother-stepchild, & in-law relationships. It is suggested that social workers & teachers should cooperate to deal with cultural stereotyping of the stepfamily & change negative social attitudes toward members of stepfamilies. Efforts should also be made by these professionals to identify stepmother-stepchild relationship problems with greater sensitivity & regularity. 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

State-level data on fertility, adoption of family planning methods, mortality, women's issues, & others were found to be consistent, thus meeting the goal of providing reliable data. A negative association between fertility & antenatal care is cited as an example of how maternal & child health services can regulate fertility & achieve widespread adoption of family planning methods. The relationship between infant & under-age-5 mortality demonstrate the importance of raising marriage ages & lack of impact of maternal & child health policies on child mortality. Female literacy was found to be the strongest determining factor in seeking maternal & child health services, with sterilization as the most likely service sought. This paints maternal & child health services as simply a way to achieve family planning targets. It is recommended that maternal & child health policies should reach all women via their greater emphasis in the overall health package. 6 Tables, 2 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Historical Perspective of the Social Work Profession

Author: Gore, M S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61545375?accountid=14925

Abstract: Traces the beginning of the social work profession to the rise of the middle class in the latter 19th century, comparing the Western & Indian experiences. Social work, as a profession, worked on behalf of the society or the establishment, adopting social action as a program in the 1960s. When professional social work was set up in India by a US missionary, its interests followed the launching of programs by the government. Dialogue between the Gandhian workers & graduates of professional schools were held but did not lead to any new initiatives for common action. Trends in & limitations of social action as a new area of work are considered. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Discusses key aspects of the family-centered social work practice model & reviews Indian literature in the areas of family life enrichment & family interventions, tracing the beginning of such social work literature back to 1976.

Abstract: In noting the lack of social work theorizing on group work, reviewed is the sparse Indian literature. Divisions between the three methods of social work are challenged & the need for systematically recording the indigenous experiences of social workers &/or social activists in India to enhance the theory base is stressed. 19 References.

Analysis of Literature on Social Action

Author: Siddiqui, H Y11 Dept Social Work Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444987?accountid=14925

Abstract: Reviews the literature on social action in India, 1940-1995, to identify the process of its development, current trends, & the future possibilities. Changing social characteristics of social work suggest that the scale of militancy in the profession will decrease rather than increase. Social action as a method, therefore, will remain on the periphery. 38 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Muzumdar, Kalindi11 Coll Social Work Nirmala Niketan Instit, Mumbai India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444980?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that social work education in India must incorporate indigenous teaching tools, noting the tendency to cling to the lecture method, probably because of the mistaken belief that it is the most effective & quickest way to impart education. However, lectures have to be supplemented by carefully selected & judiciously used teaching aids; fieldwork experience & knowledge of methods should underpin teaching. Literature related to indigenizing social work education is reviewed. 3 Tables, 11 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444962?accountid=14925

Abstract: Reviews literature in the field of human-power studies in Indian social work. The low level of professionalization of social welfare, lack of well-defined social work roles & functions, lack of specification of a minimum level of specific job training, & poor service conditions of social welfare personnel as compared to other professions are visible. Subpar social work training & lack of a governing body to provide direction to the profession are serious issues. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Krishnaswamy, Saroja1; Kulkarni, Leena V1 Dept Human Development Rural Home Science Coll U Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448166?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interview data from 200 residents of 19 working women's hostels in Bangalore, India, indicated that 41% of them suffered from high levels of anxiety. Age, education, income, & perception of one's own rural background as an obstacle in adjusting to hostel life were found to be significantly correlated with anxiety. Respondents having difficulty in commuting to work & those who were prior hostellers as students were found to have significantly more anxiety than others. As the cumulative intensity of problems related to hostel life increased, anxiety also increased significantly. Results imply the necessity of using hostel rules & regulations with discretion & empathy along with service & living condition improvements in the working women's hostels. 4 Tables, 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

Sugarcane Harvest and Transport Workers of Sugar Cooperatives in Maharashtra

Author: Jugale, V B11 Dept Economics Shivaji U, Kolhapur

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448159?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the farm sector, sugar workers are termed sugarcane harvest & transport workers & categorized into five groups: head center, bullock cart center, tire cart center, truck/tractor center, & hired, where more than six lakh workers are involved in cane harvesting & transport. Their wages, fixed by the Tripartite Awards for every 3 years, do not even cover regional minimum wages for agricultural workers. Workers are exploited at various levels by labor brokers & mukadams (head harvester gang men). Poor physical health, strains, & poverty are major problems for workers. Of late, industrial relations have changed because of court verdicts centered on the concept of a worker in the sugar industry. Sugar worker unionization is difficult because of the migratory & seasonal nature of their job. 3 Tables, 4 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Prasad, N Purendra11 British Council Division, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448141?accountid=14925

Abstract: Fieldwork conducted 1992-1994 in the 192 households of a single Indian village underpins a holistic approach exploring strategies adapted by people of different socioeconomic strata in coping with drought. Findings revealed that, despite inequalities in the social system, people of all ethnic groups & social classes come together in performing the rituals associated with the Rain God, & caste & class distinctions are temporarily suspended during crisis periods. 10 References.

Field Instruction in Social Work Education in India: Some Issues

Author: Prasad, B Devi1; Vijayalakshmi, B1 Dept Social Work Andhra U, Visakhapatnam

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448134?accountid=14925

Abstract: Field instruction, a crucial component of social work education, is recognized as an educational process to facilitate integrative & experiential learning. Though the pattern & organization of social work practicum have some universality, the microbased practice model adopted in the Indian context has led to inappropriately designed field education programs, producing students unsuited to meet the developmental needs of the Indian. Efforts made to restructure field instruction to prepare students for macrobased practice roles have been too slow to find their way into the educational program of most Indian schools of social work. Major problems, eg, scarcity of field placements, nonavailability of qualified agency-based field instructors, inadequate linkage between classroom teaching & field realities, & poor faculty positions, still prevail. Here, crucial areas for change in field instruction are examined, & alternative strategies suggested in light of emerging socioeconomic concerns & recent trends in the profession. 45 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448124?accountid=14925

Abstract: Analysis of 1994 interview data from nonworking & working women at a housing unit in Coimbatore, India (total N = 147), highlights the fact that premarital work status of women has a strong direct bearing on their age at marriage & a moderate influence through the time taken to initiate marriage after menarche; education status exhibited a greater role in influencing marriage age (indirect effect rather than its direct effect). 4 Tables, 1 Figure, 22 References.

Household and Community Response to HIV/AIDS: Executive Summary of a Study in Mumbai

Author: Bharat, Shalini11 Unit Family Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448118?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interviews with 34 people with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) & 25 household members & 18 focus groups with low-income individuals are used to assess responses to HIV/AIDS in lower-income households & communities in Mumbai, India. Data indicate that household responses are generally supportive. However, responses vary with the gender & relationship of the HIV+ individual: they are more positive for men than women & for sons more than daughters. Knowledge of HIV/AIDS at the community level is poor. Implications are discussed, & recommendations for HIV/AIDS caregivers, educational initiatives, & policy are presented. J. Ferrari

Women's Rights at the Workplace: Emerging Challenges and Legal Interventions

Author: Bajpai, Asha11 Unit Women's Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448103?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the effects of economic liberalization on women in India, suggesting that structural adjustments may increasingly marginalize women, especially in the informal economic sector. Legal & policy recommendations to protect the rights of women in the workplace are presented, including the creation of a guiding government policy, establishment of an Equal Opportunities Commission, legislation directed against sexual harassment, registration of women employees, the assurance of basic social security benefits for women, & better access to child care. These reforms must be accompanied by legal literacy programs informing women of their rights. Specific areas of concern for women in the construction, plastic & diamond, export, domestic, & sex industries also are addressed. J. Ferrari

Survey of Self-Employed Women with Special Reference to Tutors

Author: Wadia, Hilla11 Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women's U, Bombay 400020 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61587862?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines factors contributing to self-employment among Indian women, drawing on 1992 questionnaire data from 220 women tutors in Mumbai. An analytical model identified family characteristics, eg, family responsibility, cultural inhibition & taboos; infrastructural characteristics, eg, space & time constraints; & individual characteristics, eg, educational qualifications & feelings of job satisfaction, as motivations to seek self-employment. It is found that the majority of tutors were unmarried, took up tutoring because they had an interest in teaching, & wanted to support the family income. There are a number of disadvantages to tutoring, eg, unexpected visitors, staying home to work, & the inability to relieve the stress of everyday work. Self-employment is described as a time-consuming effort calling for strong self-discipline & cooperation from family members. 26 Tables, 2 Figures. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Describes the level of adoption of simple maternal & child health interventions by 162 rural mothers in the district of Rohtak in Haryana, India, drawing on index data. It was observed that adoption of maternal & child health & family planning interventions was positively & significantly correlated with educational levels of women & with exposure to mass media. The total intervention knowledge score was significantly & positively correlated with adoption index for maternal & child interventions. Women living near functional health institutions displayed a higher index for interventions than women living away from such institutions. It is argued that existing beliefs pose a barrier to intervention adoption; thus, educational, motivational, & reward systems should be developed to maintain individuals' progress through the process. 6 Tables, 2 References.

Policy Contradictions in Capitalism: An Illustration with the Hong Kong Government's Proposed Reforms on Cost-Recovery in Hospital Services

Author: Yu, Sam Wai-kam11 Division Social Studies City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61577405?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores background issues underlying the Hong Kong government's proposed cost-recovery reforms in hospital services, arguing that they do not exist in isolation, but are part of a long-term strategy of dealing with the decommodifying effects of social services. Therefore, the importance of these proposed reforms are not just limited to changes in hospital services, but are also related to other wider issues, eg, the contradictory social services-capitalism relationship & how the government deals with it. 42 References.

Indigenization of Social Work Values in Hong Kong: A Brief Review

Author: Lam, Chiu-Wan11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration U Hong Kong, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61600895?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that there is no systematic discussion on indigenization of social work values in Hong Kong, drawing on an analysis of related discourse. Chinese culture is often stereotyped as a uniform entity that is static, authoritative, & reactionary. It is contended that this is not true, & a global understanding & evaluation of Chinese culture & its manifold forms in Hong Kong is deemed necessary. Such assessment could mean more value alternatives for contemplation on indigenization, ie, to reflect on, enrich, or even replace the tenets of conventional social work values. 2 Figures, 37 References.

Local Knowledge, Indigenous Practice: Linking the Cultural, the Personal, and the Professional in Social Work Practice

Author: Kwong, Wai-man11 Dept Applied Social Studies City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61575287?accountid=14925

Abstract: The accepted means of developing culturally sensitive practice -- the successive modification of intervention theories & approaches through empirically examining their compatibility to the local cultural context & testing their effectiveness in working with Chinese clients -- is rejected. Instead it is argued that social workers have been, & still are, creating knowledge for a "Chinese social work." Large abstractions, in the form of formal theories, provide inadequate guide for practice. Social workers improvise & create context-specific & practice-relevant local knowledge that accounts for client expectations, cultural knowledge, & personal & professional experiences. 54 References.

Mental Health Service in Hong Kong: A Call for a New Policy

Author: Ma, Joyce L C11 Dept Social Work Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin New Territories

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61542304?accountid=14925

Abstract: A critical review of mental health service in Hong Kong shows that the readmission rate has been about 60% in the past 20 years, & quality of life for the mentally ill & their families is far from satisfactory. There are inadequate channels at the organizational & policy levels for policymakers to account for the views of the mentally ill & their families in service design & implementation. Here, a policy focus shift is proposed: rather than fostering dependency of the mentally ill & their families, mental health professionals should enhance self-care abilities via empowerment at the individual, organizational, & policy levels. 1 Table, 48 References.

Abstract: Introduces the features of the agrarian economy that eventually necessitate the prioritization of the utilization of limited resources in a given socioeconomic situation, offering examples from India, Nepal, Bangledesh, & Pakistan. Work options available in the given economies are discussed, & the politicoadministrative setup for the execution of the programs is outlined. It is postulated that the complementary role of the community could be more pronounced in creation of awareness, selection of sites & beneficiaries of various programs, execution of schemas & maintenance, & in decision making & feedback. 3 References.

Abstract: Analyzes the content of a stratified random sample of 194 articles published in (The Indian Journal of Social Work, 1971-1990, to identify authors' background characteristics & to document trends in empirical content, subject area, & methodological characteristics. Analysis reveals that social work/social science educators contributed significantly & a majority of the articles were written by men. Around 50% were empirical articles, but the % of nonempirical articles showed a slight increase over the years. A majority of the articles focused on areas such as family, child & social work, community development, & personnel management; less than 15% were devoted to women's issues. Quantitative descriptive studies, mostly employing survey research designs, were more common, while qualitative & analytical studies were less common & only a few articles used control/comparison groups. Of the 95 articles that mentioned sampling procedures, nonprobability sampling plans were most common. It is suggested that methodological improvements are needed to improve research quality. 10 Tables, 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Bureaucracy and Rural Development

Author: Harish, R11 Dept Studies Political Science Karnataka U, 580003 Kharwad India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61579649?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines the current problems & potential benefits of refined bureaucratic participation in rural development in Third World nations. Bureaucracy is commonly depicted as detrimental to rural development, a perception attributed to various circumstances: limitations of the central planning process, a legacy of suspicion regarding bureaucratic mechanisms in colonized nations, lack of coordination between state & local government, & the tendency for bureaucratic institutions & officers to favor state dictates over local needs. However, it is argued that effective rural development demands the expansion of bureaucracy to the local level. This form of bureaucracy is characterized by local leadership with real power, decentralization, & improved coordination & cooperation between & among the higher & lower echelons of society & government. The success of such a system relies on the ability of local leaders to challenge & reject politically motivated decisions by national ministers, politicians, & administrators. 1 Figure, 16 References.

Methodological Issues in Studies on Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Project Displaced People

Author: Parasuraman, S11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61551269?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses means of assessing the impact of resettlement & rehabilitation on people & communities displaced by development projects. Many such assessments lack information concerning the location & condition of displaced people & face such methodological problems as quantifying the effects of displacement & rehabilitation & determining the significance of host community environments & time involved in rehabilitation. Based on an extensive review of available methodologies, it is argued that evaluation of displacement must pursue a variety of goals: compensation for loss prior to moves, assistance during the moving process, efforts to improve living standards in new communities, resettlement of entire social units (family or village), provision of infrastructure in resettlement areas, & social & economic integration into host communities. Assessing this process must include baseline & follow-up surveys, consideration of the impact of resettlement on host communities, qualitative & quantitative evaluation, & recognition of the social, economic, cultural, & psychological aspects of resettlement. 4 Tables, 1 Appendix, 24 References.

Socio-Economic Condition of the Houseless Population in Rural Areas

Author: Samuel, M Johnson1; Lingaraju, M; Bhat, T N1 Population Research Centre Instit Social & Economic Change, Bangalore 560072 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61579603?accountid=14925

Abstract: The socioeconomic characteristics of homeless people in rural areas are examined based on census data from Raichur District, India. The majority of the rural homeless belonged to scheduled castes & could be categorized as migrants changing location in search of farm jobs during peak seasons, & nonworkers who earned a minimal income through begging. The children of the rural homeless were rarely sent to school, & the population was characterized by early marriage, high fertility, high mortality, low literacy, & low skills. Overcoming these problems requires housing & employment programs targeted at the rural homeless in addition to health, nutrition, family planning, education, & job training services. The nonworking population needs extensive rehabilitative efforts, while migrant workers could benefit greatly from enforcement of minimum wage & labor protection laws, provision of state-funded schooling, & establishment of flexible housing & education programs that accommodate the migrant lifestyle. 6 Tables, 14 References.

Decision Making Behaviour of Women in Farm Sector: A Study

Author: Pattnaik, Tilottama11 Krishi Vigyana Kendra, Baliapal Balasore Orissa India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61585853?accountid=14925

Abstract: The participation & decision-making roles of Indian women in farm-related activities were examined in a survey (N = 180) in Balasore District. Women participated most actively in decisions concerning farm produce storage, animal care, harvesting, crop weeding operations, & labor management. The extent of participation was correlated with both status in the family & size (or lack of) land holdings. Partial participation in decision-making activities averaged 50%; fewer than 20% claimed full participation. The most significant constraints faced by farm women were, in order of importance, inadequate exposure to necessary mass media resources, lack of contact with extension personnel, social restrictions, lack of time, & illiteracy. It is concluded that the participatory role of women can be improved through the provision of necessary information to farm women by extension workers, government & social recognition of women's potential role in farming, & self-employment programs for rural women. 3 Tables, 18 References.

Psychosomatic Problems and Social Support: Perception of Women Whose Husbands Are Abroad on Job

Author: Kaila, H L11 Dept Psychology Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women's U, Mumbai Bombay 400020 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61550009?accountid=14925

Abstract: The psychosomatic health & social support of 30 Indian women with husbands employed abroad were examined via questionnaire. Although the overall level of psychosomatic problems was low, many respondents (Rs) experienced significant problems with low energy, lower backaches, nervousness, tension, sleeplessness, &/or chest constriction. Psychosomatic problems were significantly correlated with a high number of children, longer duration of husband's absence, & the presence of in-laws. Rs received support from work, children, neighbors, & relatives; women with lower educational qualifications tended to perceive more support than their more educated counterparts. It is concluded that the psychosomatic health & support of such women could be improved through enhanced workplace support mechanisms & social recognition of their special needs & circumstances. 6 Tables, 3 References.

Professionalisation of Social Work in the United States and India

Author: Shetty, Lata

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61585797?accountid=14925

Abstract: A discussion of the professionalization of social work (SW) in the US & India focuses on the means & implications of this process. The debate over SW professionalization has evoked numerous concerns regarding its potential to reduce the moral status of the profession, increase distance between workers & clients, &/or subject social goals to market forces. However, professionalization has the advantages of enhancing the prestige & possible support of SW, refining SW skills, & attracting a more competent workforce. In the US, the increasingly scientific orientation of SW has facilitated its professionalization. SW in India remains highly dependent on Western models, & must be adapted to the special circumstances & needs of the Indian environment. India lacks the practical education mechanisms & code of ethics required by certain definitions of professionalism. However, the lack of professionalization in India may enhance services through closer communication & trust between workers & clients. 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

Male Emigration and Changes in the Family: Impact on Female Sex Roles

Author: Sekhar, T V11 Policy Research & Voluntary Action Instit Social & Economic Change, Bangalore 560072 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61551215?accountid=14925

Abstract: The impact of male (M) emigration on female (F) roles, responsibilities, & behavior both during & following M absence was explored in an interview survey of 132 wives of Persian Gulf returnees in 2 Indian villages. In terms of guardianship of family, residential arrangement, & management of household activities, M absence did not lead to family disintegration. Although Fs faced significant problems, almost 50% remained independent during the absence & the majority benefited from the support of extended kinship networks. Under these circumstances, Fs were called on to make decisions, take on responsibilities, & interact with the outside world in ways that transcended their former roles & experiences. They gained self-confidence & self-esteem, & improved their status within the family during M absence. Although some of these gains were lost on return of M partners, it is concluded that M absence generally improved the long-term independence & decision-making authority of these respondents. 4 Tables, 10 References.

Economic and Social Status of Female Heads of Households -- Need for Intervention under New Economic Policy

Author: Shanthi, K11 U Madras, 600005 Tamil Nadu India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61600462?accountid=14925

Abstract: The social & economic difficulties faced by female heads of households (FHHs) in India are discussed in reference to appropriate means of overcoming the social marginalization & economic deprivation of this rapidly expanding population. Drawing on census data from Madras, it is argued that the majority of FHHs come from underprivileged socioeconomic backgrounds. In addition to economic hardship, these women experience social exclusion & have difficulty finding jobs due to their lack of skills & education. India's new economic policy targets its education & employment programs at male workers at the expense of FHHs. Improving the socioeconomic conditions of FHHs requires a number of reforms: government-supported research & acceptance of the special needs & circumstances of FHHs; economic development & transition interventions aimed at FHHs; employment training & guarantees for this population; & transformation of public attitudes, beliefs, & actions regarding FHHs. 3 Tables.

Demographic Correlates of Poverty in Tribal Households

Author: Rao, N Baskara11 Instit Social & Economic Change, Bangalore 560072 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61600413?accountid=14925

Abstract: The relationship between poverty & a variety of demographic variables was examined via interviews with 504 households from the Marati, Malekudiya, & Koraga tribes in Dakshina Kannada District, India. Approximately 50% of the tribal households were defined as poor, & 22% as very poor. Although only a small minority failed to receive two adequate meals a day consistently, 68% experienced significant food shortages on a seasonal basis, usually during the rainy season. Poor households were characterized by smaller household size, younger heads of household, & lack of extended kinship networks. Females, especially as household heads, comprised a greater proportion of the poor & very poor groups. School attendance for girls & literacy levels for both genders were adversely affected by poverty. Accessibility of potable water, modern health facilities, & household electricity was inadequate for all households, especially among the poor. It is concluded that tribal development schemes must take into account the seasonal nature of food shortages & the greater vulnerability of females to poverty. 13 Tables, 11 References.

Abstract: Describes the development of social work as a helping profession in the People's Republic of China following 1980s economic reforms. As social work has still a relatively young history in China, the profession needs to demonstrate its effectiveness through more practical & successful demonstration projects to cope with social problems apart from its traditional preoccupation in social casework.

Abstract: Examines the relationship among adolescent suicidal ideation, social support, & effective help for adolescent suicidal ideation in Hong Kong, drawing on scale data from 225 subjects, ages 12-21, with suicidal ideation or who had been approached by someone who had suicidal ideation in the past 2 years. Results showed that family & opposite-sex relationship problems, parental neglect & abuse, & academic problems are the main causes of suicidal ideation. Adolescents with suicidal ideation had weaker social support, particularly familial. Implications are discussed. 29 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Possibility of Developing the Integrated Team Model for Children and Youth Service in Hong Kong

Author: Lee, Francis Wing-lin11 Dept Social Work Chinese U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444381?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Hong Kong, increasing coordination & collaboration among different conventional modes of children & youth services is an advocated transitional measure before the recommended integrated team model of children & youth service provision can be fully implemented. However, it is speculated that attitudes of youth workers regarding different modes of service influence successful implementation of integrated teams. Questionnaire data from 256 youth/children workers underpin a discussion of important issues & recommendations for the realization of the integrated team model. 12 References.

Lone Mothers and Poverty: Challenges to Social Security Policy

Author: Leung, Lai-ching11 Dept Applied Social Studies City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444371?accountid=14925

Abstract: Prior research (eg, interview studies) underpins an examination of three interlocking factors related to the poverty of lone mothers in Hong Kong: social & financial barriers to paid employment, failure of policy designed to encourage welfare recipients to seek labor participation & risky loss of social support concomitant with low-paid employment. Other employment barriers are addressed. Social policy needs to address the gendered division of labor in the family, labor market, & social security system. 18 References.

Safe Use of Medicine by Older Adults in Hong Kong

Author: Chi, Iris1; Ip, Frances; Lo, Eva; Chui, Ernest1 Dept Social Work & Social Administration U Hong Kong, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444355?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines drug use & safety issues among older adults in Hong Kong, drawing on in-depth interview & observation data from 6 elderly persons & their families, as well as interview & questionnaire data from geriatricians & a pharmacist representative. Findings reveal that insufficient advice is given to the elderly regarding proper use of medicines; most elderly lack a personal record of medicinal intake/history; & elderly are unaware of their patient rights & often fall prey to uneven power relations, resulting in poor communication. Positives & negatives of drug labeling are addressed, & the role of pharmacists in medication supervision is outlined. Recommendations are made, particularly with respect to the role of social workers. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Longitudinal scale & questionnaire data are used to explore the effects of family structure, family stress, & adolescent mental well-being on secondary school students in Hong Kong & Guangzhou, People's Republic of China (total N = 2,142). Findings reveal that a higher % of Hong Kong subjects (Ss) were psychologically at-risk & exhibited depressive & anxiety symptoms; male Ss were less inclined to be psychologically at risk; female Ss demonstrated less ability in coping yet received more social support from friends. Implications for social work service, policy making, & future research are considered. J. W. Parker

A Longitudinal Study on the Inter-Relationships amongst Family Factors, Coping Resources, and Psychosocial Adjustment in Hong Kong Adolescents

Author: Shek, Daniel T L1; Chan, Lai-Kwan; Lee, Tak-yan; Ngai, Ngan-pun1 Dept Social Work Chinese U, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444366?accountid=14925

Abstract: Longitudinal questionnaire data from 429 Hong Kong families are used to examine (1) effects of multiple family factors on children's coping resources & psychosocial adjustment, (2) connections between family factors, & (3) the relationship between family factors, coping resources, & psychosocial adjustment in adolescents. Findings indicate that lower levels of family competence were associated with high psychiatric morbidity & low self-esteem in adolescents; families with positive marital relationships more frequently produced positive developmental & mental health outcomes for adolescents; & high availability of coping resources resulted in decreased psychiatric morbidity & mental health difficulties. Similar to previous research, it is concluded that family factors strongly influence the development of adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Wegner, Susan D1; David, Gerson1 c/o David -- Graduate School Social Work U Houston, TX 77204-2162

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61623482?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Machakos Village Development Simulation Game, based on a case study of a human development project initiated in Kenya in 1978 by the Instit of Cultural Affairs, is presented as a curriculum tool for stimulating dialogue about international development issues. The evolution of development practice is traced since the 1950s, the Machakos simulation's origin in the early 1980s is summarized, the four phases of game play & arenas of classroom dialogue are outlined, & concepts utilized during the course of game play & postgame relations are clarified. The game focuses on human factors, integrated development, & local involvement. Participants gain factual information about village development concerns, & process & change their perspectives & attitudes toward development-related world issues. Use of the Machakos Game is advocated as a tool in US social work curriculum. 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Concept of Empowerment in Social Work Practice

Author: Parsloe, Phyllida11 U Bristol, BS8 1TH England

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61431398?accountid=14925

Abstract: Empowerment, when used by the political Right to signify power by citizens over their own lives & an increase in the caring responsibility of families, tends to individualize citizens & operates at the level of service provision. When used by the far Left, empowerment has a collective focus that clients should have a greater say in the nature of the services they receive & the way in which they are provided. Explored here is whether power-sharing might be a more honest, albeit more difficult, aim for social work. The utility of the concepts of partnership, participation, & user involvement is considered. 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Intensive Family Services: A New Old Approach to Social Work Practice

Author: Glasser, Paul11 Rutgers U, New Brunswick NJ 08903

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61424377?accountid=14925

Abstract: A review of changes in social work philosophy in the US during the twentieth century notes that, in the early part of the century, through the work of activists such as Jane Addams, social work focused on the family & the provision of resources for those in need. During mid-century, the focus moved to the individual & internal psychic processes, & is now moving back toward an emphasis on the family & interpersonal relations. These new developments are discussed, with an emphasis on how previous perspectives are innovated in the contemporary context. Focus is placed on a new orientation to practice -- intensive family services -- that emphasizes work with the family unit. Implications for an application of this approach in other regions, particularly Hong Kong, are also discussed. 31 References. Adapted from the source document.

Social Work Practice in a Chinese Society: Reflections and Challenges

Author: Chau, Kenneth L11 Dept Social Work Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin New Territories

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61458439?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is claimed that attention to cultural imperatives is a prerequisite to effective practice; by linking social work practice & services more closely to the social & cultural contexts of the practice environment, social work can be made more culturally sensitive, enhancing its effectiveness. Major developments in indigenizing social work in Hong Kong are highlighted, based on a review of local literature, & future challenges are identified. Ways of moving forward in developing practice formulation & technologies most relevant to the cultural uniqueness of Hong Kong as a Chinese society in transition are considered. 26 References.

Healing in the Chinese Temple: A Challenge to Clinical Social Work Practice

Author: Ng, Ho-yee11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration U Hong Kong, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61493529?accountid=14925

Abstract: Awareness of the relevance of spiritual & religious dimensions in social work practice has been renewed & cogently argued in overseas literature. In Hong Kong, temple going & healing rituals are common. Here, a temple healing ritual is analyzed, based on a tape-recorded instance. A parallel is drawn between psychotherapeutic work & temple healing. It is argued that temple healing challenges the foundation of clinical social work with Chinese clients. 31 References.

Focus is on the professional training qualification in social work (ie, the Diploma in Social Work), & the features of the training programs. A teaching & learning method, Enquiry & Action Learning (EAL), is also examined, along with the strengths & merits of the single professional qualification system, the establishment of an official professional body, & the use of EAL in social work education. Implications for the social work profession & training in Hong Kong are discussed. 14 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Young, Katherine11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration U Hong Kong, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61630577?accountid=14925

Abstract: Proposes a framework for assessing the diverse patterns of extramarital affairs, in Hong Kong, noting implications for marriage counseling.

Government-NGO Interface in India: An Overview

Author: Garain, Swapan11 Dept Social Welfare Administration Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61591541?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the absence of a clear NGO (nongovernmental organization) policy of the government, explored here is the role of the government in the promotion of the NGO sector in India. Although government documents & government appointed committee reports reflect the need for increased NGO participation in government sponsored development efforts, only a few concrete steps have been taken in this direction. There is an ever-increasing realization about the importance of a continuous dialogue between different levels of bureaucracy & the NGO sector to develop confidence & accept each other as equal partners for the development of the poor, deprived, & disadvantaged. These issues are analyzed. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Progressiveness of a Farmer in Developing Countries: A Conceptual Framework

Author: Ojha, S N

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61627363?accountid=14925

Abstract: Progressiveness in agriculture is mostly used to express innovativeness, modernity, & entrepreneurship. When such a concept is expressed with nonmanipulative personal characteristics, it becomes difficult to bring out a progressive change. In a developing country, personal characteristics are less determining than sociostructural ones. Here, the concept of social progress is discussed. Six activities of progressiveness are operationalized. This may help in developing a training program on progressiveness of farmers. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 25 References. Adapted from the source document.

Women Managers in Transition: From Homes to Corporate Offices

Author: Parikh, Indira J1; Shah, Nayana A1 Organisational Behaviour Area Indian Instit Management, Ahmedabad 380015 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61578717?accountid=14925

Abstract: The entry of Indian women into management, their career paths, & the obstacles to those paths are explored using data on 600 women managers obtained in programs, seminars, & workshops conducted over a 15-year period. The entry of women into management was a product of industrialization & the trend toward universal education. In the 1950s, many women entered work organizations for monetary reasons. They tended to be job- (vs career-) oriented & ran traditional homes. During the 1960s-70s, women entered management in larger numbers & were better educated. They tended to be career-oriented & broke social stereotypes. In the 1980s, both women & men managers became more professionally oriented. They held corporate notions, but worked to redefine social & work spaces & roles. Barriers to women have included traditional agrarian images, patriarcy, family responsibilities, & internal socialization. An integrative approach to the lives of women managers can improve their situation & performance. 1 Table, 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods for the Poor: What NGOs Have to Learn

Author: Mahajan, Vijay

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61608493?accountid=14925

Abstract: Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) need to improve their qualitative & quantitative performance if they are to reduce poverty & promote livelihood, employment, & income generation. NGOs should specialize, concentrate on larger-scale projects, assist producers' groups rather than emphasizing their own programs (which are often paternalistic), seek more effective management, establish connections with technological & governmental institutions & agribusiness, raise capital from mainstream sources, & recruit & train high-quality personnel. Encouraging & materially assisting groups & communities to generate employment & income will have a longer-term positive impact on poverty than will relief, welfare, & awareness-building efforts. 1 Table, 7 References.

HRD for Societal Systems: A Social Identity Based Approach

Author: Agrawal, N M11 HAL Staff Coll, Vimanapura Bangalore India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61343052?accountid=14925

Abstract: The causes for the failure of national development efforts in India & the widening gap between rich & poor are analyzed using a construct of social identity. Many development efforts have taken a conventional modernization approach that disregards social identity factors such as historical & geographical perspective, status, education, socialization, & self-perception. In order for development efforts to succeed, they must change the social identity of India's poor. Oppressed groups must be made aware of their current social identity & its negative consequences. Literacy & self-confidence must be raised, & the poor must be empowered with the assistance of those who care about their well-being. Voluntary organizations are better positioned than the government to attempt this; action research strategies are recommended. 1 Figure, 67 References. Adapted from the source document.

Is There a Place of Reminiscence in Family Counselling?

Author: Hall, Barry L11 Faculty Social Work U Calgary, Alberta T2N 1N4

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61633774?accountid=14925

Abstract: Suggests that the elderly present a rich reservoir of family history that can be beneficial to the counseling process. It is suggested that one way for the counselor to tap into this history is to encourage the use of reminiscence with aged persons & their families. Here, examined is how reminiscing with older persons can be a therapeutic resource that can be integrated into most approaches to family treatment. 36 References. Adapted from the source document.

Ecology of Social Administration in India

Author: Barik, R K11 Indian Instit Public Administration, India Prastha Estate New Delhi 110002

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61604407?accountid=14925

Abstract: Assesses the contributions of Herbert Spencer, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, & Mohandas Gandhi to the creation of the Indian welfare state. Classical liberalism held that the state's responsibilities were to protect individual rights to property & life, but academic activists have fundamentally challenged that idea. Spencer was perhaps most important in constructing welfare polices for the poor because he shifted the focus of administrative theory from civil to social administration. Marx then brought economic questions to the forefront by demonstrating that poverty stems from capitalism, while Weber helped advocates of social administration argue that welfare policies can function objectively. Finally, Durkheim's concern with the moral fabric of society & Gandhi's concept of public trusteeship helped facilitate a "moral marriage" between the ruling class & the state on a sustained basis. 2 References.

Migration Pattern and Occupational Change (A Study of Palamur Labour in A.P.)

Author: Chakrapani, C1; Kumar, S Vijaya1 CD Deshmukh IMPART Centre Council Social Development, Hyderabad 500013 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61610245?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using census data collected on 6,891 migrants living in Mahbubnagar District, Andhra Pradesh, India, examined are problems & issues associated with large-scale outmigration in both urban & rural areas. Findings reveal that: drought conditions force people to migrate in search of work; continuous migration leaves people out of developmental programs; interdistrict migration seems to be the dominant flow in the direction of urban areas; the major shift in occupation is to nonagricultural labor; & incomes of migrants have increased substantially. Provision of self-employment opportunities & distribution of land are measures suggested by migrants to check large-scale migration. 8 Tables, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Cheng, Long-chi Rinna11 Division Humanities & Social Sciences City Polytechnic Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61604840?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores the mechanism of change in the treatment process of stress inoculation training (SIT) via an examination of its impacts on 4 local Chinese clients having stress & anxiety. Thirty-three audiotaped interviews revealed that the technical activity of SIT was best described by the therapist verbal response of direct guidance & information & the intention of change & giving information. Among all treatment components, both the worker & the clients rated the education on the transactional nature of stress, cognitive restructuring, & relapse prevention on stress recurrence as helpful; relaxation training as nonhelpful, though with delayed effect; & behavioral rehearsal & problem solving with inconsistent reaction. As for the impact, the worker showed more concern with the treatment-specific tasks of skills training in problem solution while the clients emphasized insight, awareness, & nonspecific features of the treatment. 1 Table, 22 References.

Engaging Outreaching Clients

Author: Leung, Chi-fai11 Dept Social Work & Social Administration U Hong Kong, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61627293?accountid=14925

Abstract: Strategies for social worker outreach to marginal youth clients in Hong Kong are based on reinforcement theory & exchange theory. The goal is to minimize the costs & maximize the rewards of worker-client interactions. Client-related costs include skepticism, apprehension, fear of criticism, stigmatization, & concern of having illegal activities reported. Social workers face costs associated with client testing behaviors. Other costs arise from differences between worker & client (eg, communication patterns, values). Several specific suggestions are offered for social workers to minimize costs & maximize rewards. 39 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Siganporia, Munira

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61588487?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interview data from 100 divorced Muslim women from Bombay & Pune (India) are used to describe postdivorce problems as well as extent & forms of social support. Most respondents (Rs) had little education, belonged to the lower socioeconomic class, & were employed mostly in unskilled jobs. Most returned to live with their parents after the divorce. Findings also indicate that husbands exerted greater control over divorce strategy & outcome than wives. In most cases, Rs suffered postdivorce financial hardship & socioemotional & parent-child relationship problems. Emphasized is the importance of family support, along with women's self-reliance. Despite the difficulties, 88% were happy that the marriage ended. 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Participatory Approach to Urban Development: Case Study of Indore Habitat Improvement Project

Author: Thudipara, Jacob Z11 Indore School Social Work, Madhya Pradesh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61636269?accountid=14925

Abstract: One of the consequences of rapidly increasing urbanization in India has been rapid growth of slums & informal settlements, where people live without physical amenities like water, sanitation, roads, drainage, education, health, or opportunities for socioeconomic development. Traditionally, municipal agencies have been saddled with the task of the provision & maintenance of these facilities. However, experience has revealed that local self-governments alone cannot undertake the enormous task of urban development. Examined here is the participatory approach adopted by the Indore Habitat Improvement Project for slum upgradation in Madhya Pradesh. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 1 Reference. Adapted from the source document.

Mental Illness and Family Response: A Study of Coping Techniques

Author: Vijayalakshmi, B1; Ramana, K V1 Dept Social Work Andhra U, Visakhapatnam 530003 Andhra Pradesh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61584317?accountid=14925

Abstract: Structured interview data from 1 significant member in each of 100 families are drawn on to explore the adjustments made by family members when a member develops mental illness. Several coping techniques are identified, with families frequently having moved from one to another during the prehospitalization stage. The coping techniques used are a function of the family's reaction to abnormal behavior. The use of multiple coping techniques is inevitable due to the lack of clarity regarding appropriate help sources. 2 Tables, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61596086?accountid=14925

Abstract: Semistructured questionnaire data from 100 parents of mentally retarded children in Secunderabad, India, are used to assess the effects of professional intervention on parental perceptions & expectations of their children. From among 10 major perceptions, significant changes were noted in the areas regarding poor brain development as a cause for the condition, & the possibility of improvement in the child with training. Out of 14 different expectations, significant changes were noted in the areas of total cure, & need for special education & speech development, where the number asking for the former reduced & for the latter, increased. Results are discussed with a focus on the importance of the parental perceptions & expectations in the training of mentally retarded persons. 5 Tables, 2 Figures, 16 References.

The Family: Some Reflections on Future Policy

Author: Blackstone, Tessa11 Birbeck Coll U London, WC1E 7HU England

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61625933?accountid=14925

Abstract: Arguing that divorce signifies the dissolution of a marriage, not of a family, specialist counseling & conciliation services are recommended. These require high professional standards & should have some government support. Child care, flexible working arrangements, & child benefit & income support are three main policy areas where adjustment is required to take into account the needs of single-parent families. Personal experience on the management committee of a family policy studies center in London, England, is drawn on to support these arguments. 3 References. Adapted from the source document.

Re-Organising the Experience of Self and the Spouse: An Integrated Model Based on N.L.P. and Meditation

Author: Singh, Ram N11 School Social Work Grand Valley State U, Grand Rapids MI 49401-9403

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61642189?accountid=14925

Abstract: A treatment model for marital couples in conflict is presented that highlights training each partner to develop the capacity to experience the real self & differentiate it from the "pseudo-self" that contributes to blaming & feeling victimized. Three levels of self -- the mundane, the intermediary, & the higher -- are differentiated. Some techniques of meditation & neurolinguistic programing are presented to facilitate reorganization of the experience of self, which, it is argued, will ultimately reduce interpersonal conflicts & promote self-growth. 35 References.

Ecology and the Law

Author: Nadkarni, Vimla V11 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work Tata Instit Social Sciences, Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61612314?accountid=14925

Abstract: A critical evaluation of post-1972 legislation governing ecological conservation in India, drawing on the classification framework of Chattrapati Singh ("Environment and the Law" in Nathawat, G. S., Shastri, Satish, & Vyas, J. P., Man, Nature and the Environment, Jaipur: RBSA Publishers, 1988, 97-103). Singh's framework classifies laws affecting citizens, according to structural & functional categories with a protective vs planning focus. Water, pollution, & forest conservation laws are classified, & gaps in coverage & other drawbacks are indicated. It is concluded that India has largely failed to translate international environmental policy into law. Suggestions are made for actions that can be taken by social workers & activists to encourage the enactment of effective environmental protection laws. 1 Table, 1 Appendix, 11 References.

Child Workers: An Analysis of Their Terms of Employment

Author: Das, D. K. Lal1; Sekhar, S F Chandra1 Coll Social Work, Red Hills Hyderabad 500004 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61596499?accountid=14925

Abstract: With the rapid growth of Indian industry has come an increase in child labor. Child workers have very little say in choosing their occupation, have no rights as workers, & cannot join labor unions to protect themselves against exploitation. Here, data obtained during interviews with child workers at 26 industries in Vishakapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, are drawn on to describe their terms of employment. Analysis reveals that child workers in lower age groups working on a temporary basis react to their terms of employment differently than do those in higher age groups who work either as casual or contract workers. 2 Tables, 7 References. Adapted from the source document.

Training for Urban Community Development Personnel

Author: Thudipara, Jacob Z11 Indore School Social Work, Madhya Pradesh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61638712?accountid=14925

Abstract: The continuing explosion of India's urban population has contributed to the rapid growth of slums & informal settlements that lack physical amenities like water, sanitation, roads, drainage, education, health care, & opportunities for socioeconomic development. Described here are government-initiated programs for urban community development designed to improve the quality of life of the urban poor through active participation of the community. To this end, both official & nonofficial functionaries are being trained for capacity building at grass-roots level. The training programs for community organizers of these projects are outlined. 1 Figure, 10 References. Adapted from the source document.

Child Abuse in India: A Theoretical Overview

Author: Segal, Uma A11 Dept Social Work U Missouri, Saint Louis 63121

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61648356?accountid=14925

Abstract: Cross-cultural literature has brought awareness that child abuse is a phenomenon that occurs internationally, both in developed & developing countries, across the globe. Awareness & knowledge of child abuse in developing countries is relatively recent & its recognition is often camouflaged by the norms, values, & expectations of differing sociocultural traditions. It is suggested that the 1988 definition of child abuse adopted by the first National Seminar on Child Abuse in India is an important first step in the process of intervention. The definition, however, does not differentiate between societal abuse -- perpetuated in the form of child prostitution, child labor, child beggary, & child marriage -- & intrafamilial abuse resulting from parental action/inaction. Consequently, human service practitioners may be more responsive to the harmful effects of societal abuse. Much greater focus needs to be placed on the effects of parental abuse, perceptions of Indian nationals regarding this area should be assessed, & consciousness-raising efforts must be directed to address the rights of children within boundaries of the family structure. Literature on child abuse in India is reviewed, & implications for researchers, human service professionals, & policymakers are discussed. 35 References. AA

Training for Communication Skills -- Implications for Community Education

Author: Rustomfram, Nasreen11 Dept Extra Mural Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61648434?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on community work & subsequent training program with grass-roots functionaries in the areas of adult literacy & community health in India, the andragogical underpinnings of the methodology used in training, with particular reference to the context of poverty, are examined. The analysis emphasizes the importance of following a participative methodology, & argues that communication & interpersonal skills are as important for paraprofessionals, if not more so, than the technical content of what they impart in the community. 1 Table, 7 References.

Agricultural Modernisation, Value of Children and Fertility Behaviour

Author: Murthy, P V11 Population Studies Centre Sri Venkateswara U, Andhra Pradesh 20166 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61649060?accountid=14925

Abstract: An examination of the effects of both economic & noneconomic (social, psychological, cultural) costs & benefits of childrearing in family-size decisions among Indian rural parents, in the context of agricultural modernization. It is assumed that parents' evaluation of costs & benefits of children determines fertility behavior. Analysis of interview data obtained from 300 couples from developed & 300 from backward villages in Andhra Pradesh, India, reveals a negative relationship between (1) perception of economic costs & desired family size; & (2) agricultural modernization & fertility. 4 Tables, 2 Appendixes, 21 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61621390?accountid=14925

Abstract: Among Indian cities, Bombay has long had the best mass transit facilities in the form of suburban railways & a good road transport network, which led to large-scale suburbanization, particularly after 1950. Here, based on census data supplemented by field observations, the distinctive features of the suburbs are contrasted to the city, with focus on demographic change over the last few decades. In particular, the characteristics of western vs eastern, & inner vs outer, suburbs are compared. 12 Tables, 3 Figures, 1 Appendix, 5 References. Adapted from the source document.

College Student Volunteers in Mental Hospital Programmes

Author: Ranganathan, M1; Reddy, G N Narayana; Shariff, I A; Parthasarathy, R; Kaliaperumal, V G1 Dept Psychiatric Social Work National Instit Mental Health & Neuro Sciences, Bangalore India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61627660?accountid=14925

Abstract: A comparative study of 30 college student volunteers working in mental hospital settings (MHS) in India as part of the National Service Scheme, vs a control group of 30 students involved in activities other than mental health. The MHS students were solicited to offer their services to 30 long-stay patients for a period of 9 months. Changes in students' attitudes & improvement in patients' behavior were assessed at 3 & 6 months, & the results compared with those of controls. Results are discussed in the context of psychiatric social workers' contribution toward involvement of volunteers in mental health services arguing that paraprofessional & volunteer services need to be better utilized. 5 Tables, 1 Appendix, 10 References.

Female Labour Force in the Unorganised Sector of Mat Industries -- Some Evidence

Author: Manimekalai, N1; Sundari, S1 Bharathidasan U, Trichy Tamil Nadu 620024 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61632077?accountid=14925

Abstract: Structured interviews were conducted in 1989/90 with 110 female (F) workers employed in the mat weaving industries of Amoor & Ayyampalayam, Tamil Nadu, India, to explore their working conditions & problems. Data regarding the general population, the labor market, & employment trends are also reported. Labor force participation of Fs is greater than that of males (Ms) in the unorganized mat weaving sector, but despite these Fs' employment, 90+% were found to be living below the poverty line. Recommendations are made for: improved working conditions; a minimum wage based on a time rate equal to that of Ms; increased training in weaving, dyeing, & related skills; & government commitment to women's work issues & poverty eradication programs. 3 Tables, 6 References. Adapted from the source document.

Rural-Urban Differences: The Migrants' Perspective

Author: Kamra, Sarita11 Panjab U, Chandigarh 160014 Union Territory India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61601382?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rural-urban differences in India are examined in relation to prevailing rural-urban typologies developed in the West, questioning whether these differences are perceived as inequitable by the people, or are just sociological constructs. Views of urban social reality held by 100 male migrants are compared to those of rural reality expressed by 65 (most male) head of households in open-ended interviews, exploring trends in religion, kinship, caste, & occupation. Conclusions partly confirm stereotypical notions about rural-urban differences. It is argued that the contemporary "no difference theory" obscures the reality of age-old Indian urban culture & also underestimates the urban area changes over the past thirty years. 6 Tables, 2 Appendixes, 24 References. Adapted from the source document.

Progress in Literacy in India -- A Statistical Analysis

Author: Karkal, Malini

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61632639?accountid=14925

Abstract: Literacy in India is examined by rural vs urban areas, sex, & different states, using census reports for 1961-1981. The data show that while the literacy rate increased proportionately, with the increase in population, the actual number of illiterates rose from 325.3 million to 424.3 million. It is also found that much of the gain in literacy rates was among urban populations; the bias against the rural population was greater than that against females. 15 Tables, 4 References.

Abstract: A report of students' (N not specified) evaluation of faculty teaching performance at the Shinde School of Social Work, Kolhapur, Maharashtra, India. Arguing that students are one of the best sources of evaluation, since they are the target audience, a group evaluation technique was developed based on determination of dimensions relating to faculty teaching ability. This performance appraisal tool can be used as a guide for teaching staff improvement. 3 Tables, 1 Chart, 7 References. Adapted from the source document.

At the Cross Roads: Whither Social Policy?

Author: Viswanathan, N11 School Social Work Adelphi U, Garden City NY 11530

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61654401?accountid=14925

Abstract: A discussion of the debate over approaches to development -- the state-centric vs the market model -- focusing on the case of India. The alleged shortcomings & uneven distribution of benefits resulting from state or government intervention have increased the pressure to consider alternative routes to development via privatization & market-oriented mechanisms. It is concluded that the direction of social policies will be influenced by the way in which the questions raised in the debate are addressed & resolved. 1 Figure. Adapted from the source document.

Workers' Participation, Self-Management and Workers' Control

Author: Sarma, A M11 Unit Labour Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, POB 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61637656?accountid=14925

Abstract: Differing interpretations of the concepts of worker participation, self-management, & control are illustrated by a review of: workers' participation in management in the UK since 1920, the Federal Republic of Germany's codetermination system, the Japanese system of providing worker security, the Gandhian concept of constructive capital/labor cooperation & trusteeship in India, & social self-management decision making in Yugoslavia. Case studies on workers' control at Dynavac Project Limited in Melbourne, Australia, Regent Knitting in St. Jerome, Quebec, & Kamani Tubes Limited in India are compared. It is concluded that an infrastructure of participative work culture must be built in an organization for successful worker participation in management & human resource development. Furthermore, workers should be encouraged to start small self-managed firms & universities need to provide self-management counseling & appropriate curricula. V. Wagener

Author: Gangopadhyay, A11 Dept Personnel Management & Industrial Relations Tata Instit Social Sciences, POB 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61655266?accountid=14925

Abstract: A job characteristics model is developed that postulates occupational stress results from interaction of psychosocial job characteristics. Discussion centers on: the relationship between work stress factors & outcome variables that deter short- & long-term organizational effectiveness; the relationship between occupational stress variables & organizational effectiveness; stress management through development of an adaptive coping cycle; & pathogenic reactions to the arousal of the psychophysiological system from occupational stress. 3 Figures, 6 References.

Changing Pattern of Social Work Education in Developing Countries with Special Reference to India -- Need for Alternative Models

Author: Nanavatty, Meher C11 Social Welfare & Development Greater Kailash II, New Delhi India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61614877?accountid=14925

Abstract: A brief review of the Western model of social work education utilized by developing countries is followed by an account of efforts to adapt it or develop alternative models in Latin America, Africa, & Asia. The curriculum design in schools of social work in India has reflected the US pattern. In respose to growing concerns about the suitability of the model for both India's social work educators & practitioners, three models of social work education -- change-oriented, mixed, & professional interest-based -- are charted. 1 Chart, 18 References.

Social Development and Issues of Distributive Justice

Author: Robins, Arthur J11 School Medicine U Missouri, Columbia 65211

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61658071?accountid=14925

Abstract: Nation building unifies diverse groups in a plural society while social development distributes resources among diverse groups. The greatest potential for conflict occurs when ethnic differences are coterminus with religious differences. In order to provide guidelines to further social development & obtain consensus for nation building, management of conflict is examined, with respect to selection of canons of distributive justice, equality as a goal, & aspects of equality as a state policy. 1 Table, 6 References.

Shifting Cultivation: An Aspect of Tribal Exploitation

Author: Burman, J. J. Roy11 Unit Social Policy Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61601426?accountid=14925

Abstract: Shifting cultivation in India is practiced predominantly by tribal groups & is the dominant method of production of 12% of the tribal population. The method is highly organized & efficient & produces yields in inhospitable uplands inappropriate to modern sophisticated technology. Though development agencies criticize shifting cultivation as unscientific, wasteful, & resulting in depletion of forests & the environment, little authentic evidence exists to support this position. Government policies to replace shifting cultivation with such alternative practices as the construction of terraces & individual ownership rights have been met with resistance, & seem to stem from the state's desire to gain control over tribal community lands. 3 Tables, 17 References.

Changing Tribal Scene through Development Programmes in Kerala

Author: Khan, M Z1; Thomas, M E1 Dept Social Work Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61626725?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interview data are used to examine the impact of development programs on the socioeconomic conditions of tribal & nontribal groups (N = 107 & 93 respondents, respectively) in Wayanad District, India. On the whole, tribal development programs have been largely ineffective. Whereas 53% of tribal households are literate or educated, the rate for nontribals is 95%. Nontribals tend to work in business & agriculture, & tribals often work for daily wages or in agriculture. Despite being targeted for development programs, tribals have had significantly less exposure to them than have nontribals & their participation is relatively low. Tribals perceive themselves as showing significantly less economic, nutritional, & educational betterment & increases in leisure time as compared to nontribals. 4 Tables, 10 References. D. Generoli

Developing Entrepreneurship in Remote Rural-Tribal Communities

Author: Setty, E Desingu11 Asian Instit Technology, POB 2754 Bangkok 10501 Thailand

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61626682?accountid=14925

Abstract: The development of indigenous entrepreneurship among rural tribal populations in India is examined using a field approach to study community physical conditions, political & economic structures, human resources, & cultural patterns. Three levels of problems in developing entrepreneurship are noted: (1) individual characteristics, eg, lack of motivation, inhibition, & ignorance of opportunities; (2) group problems, eg, lack of awareness, preference for traditional occupations & professions, & apathy, fear, & insecurity toward government; & (3) institutional problems, eg, vague & unrealistic policies unsupported by action, & lack of teamwork & internal coordination in agencies. A five phase approach to enhancing entrepreneurship is outlined. 1 Reference. D. Generoli

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61627457?accountid=14925

Abstract: The impact of the Integrated Rural Development Programme in alleviating poverty in the Dhenkanai district of Orissa, India, during the Six Plan period (1980-1985) was examined through an interview survey of 977 beneficiary households. Analysis reveals that 38% of households below poverty level prior to onset of the program crossed above the poverty line after program assistance. Service & business sectors performed better than any others. Problems with the implementation of the program included improper identification of beneficiary households, technical & economic infeasibility of schemes, lack of working capital, supply of inferior & diseased animals in the animal husbandry scheme, lack of proper supervision, inappropriate use of assistance, & inadequate loan accounting. 3 Tables, 5 References.

Community Based Rehabilitation for the Mentally Handicapped -- A Model

Author: Narayan, Suma11 Thakur Hari Prasad Instit Mentally Handicapped, Hyderabad India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61614844?accountid=14925

Abstract: A working model for community-based care for the mentally retarded in India is proposed that aims at three levels of intervention. Primary intervention focuses on lowering the incidence of mental retardation through improved health education, dietary corrections, proper antenatal care, & preschool education & care for children. Secondary prevention aims at early identification of retardation, & reduction of its negative effects. Tertiary prevention aims at reducing the disabilities of retardation through training. Major components of the model include establishing a model center, training & development of personnel, community approach to rendering services, home-based programs, day-care centers, vocational training, follow-up, coordination of services, & evaluation & replication. 3 Figures, 3 References.

Role of Development in the Aid of the Handicapped

Author: Krishnaswamy, S

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61618970?accountid=14925

Abstract: The role of science & technology in the prevention of handicaps & in the alleviation of problems faced by the handicapped in India is examined. Despite the implementation of immunization & other health programs, increased food production, & provision of science & technology-based rehabilitation services, the plight of the handicapped remains acute. No targets of the government's 1987 Expanded Programme of Immunization have been achieved, & only 17.7% of children under age one have been immunized against polio; the immunization rate for other childhood diseases ranges from a high of 38.2% for diptheria to nearly 0% for measles. Food consumption has remained the same for the past 2 decades & evidence exists of a serious distribution imbalance. Maternal, child health, & obstetric practices cover only a small amount of the targeted population, & low birthweight is found in 33% of all children. The ratio of road accidents per 10,000 vehicles is the highest in the world. Education & training services benefit only 30,000 of the population of disabled children. The chances of achieving "Health for All by 2000 AD" are very pessimistic. 3 Tables, 17 References. D. Generoli

Abstract: Ways school facilities can be enhanced through social work services (SWS) to meet the developmental needs of children are described, citing various types of counseling programs. The introduction of school SWS in Bombay, India, beginning in the late 1950s is reviewed, centering on the roles of the state, school staff & teachers, & parents. It is argued that fully developed school SWS provide for children's needs, & serve as a platform for adults to design schools as "growth-oriented experiences." A five-day workshop held in 1987 for school counselors & child guidance workers to discuss effective counseling methods, theoretical approaches, & programs relevant to the local culture is described. 20 References.

Mental Health of School Children: Role of Teachers

Author: Thakker, Daksha11 Child Guidance Clinic Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61652672?accountid=14925

Abstract: Practical information to enlighten teachers about the mental health & development of children is presented, emphasizing organic, psychological, & social needs. Problems teachers encounter are examined for two age groups: 5-12 & 3-16. The importance of teachers' mental health is analyzed with respect to motives for becoming a teacher, & fears & anxieties. It is suggested that working toward improvement of the mental health of their pupils should give teachers a sense of satisfaction that will promote their own mental health. 6 References. S. Dilts

Play Materials in Therapeutic Work with Children

Author: Kashyap, Lina

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61655211?accountid=14925

Abstract: Because communication with children through words alone is frequently difficult, it is proposed that social workers can make effective use of therapeutic play in working with child clients. The importance of play in a child's life, & a history of its evolution & function as a therapeutic medium, are described. Three types of play materials -- raw, construction, & finished -- are discussed, & examples given of their use in therapy, drawing on case studies. Particular focus is on the importance of art as a form of self-expression & communication, & as a means of recalling the past. When selecting games, it is recommended that social workers be aware of their own goals, the therapeutic outcome desired, & the interpretive implications involved in this choice. 9 References. S.

Developmental Work with Children's Groups

Author: Gandevia, Katy Y11 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61652619?accountid=14925

Abstract: The importance of the group concept in children's development & a brief history of working with children in therapeutic groups are discussed, focusing on two types of children's group therapy: growth-centered groups for children considered "normal"; & problem-centered groups, which offer more structure. To ensure that both types of groups produce positive outcomes, the importance of selection of members, size, length, & frequency of sessions, & duration of the group session, are stressed. Key therapeutic concepts common to both types of groups are examined, & suggestions for organizing groups are offered, highlighting important factors in both the initial & working phases. Although the group format is considered effective in many areas, problems that require outside attention are also outlined; recommendations are made for working with families & teachers, & for tapping outside resources. Finally, examples of four group sessions are provided. 2 Tables, 4 References. S. Dilts

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61562045?accountid=14925

Abstract: Secondary source data are drawn on to examine home-based, piece-rate women workers in India, examining some of the socioeconomic & environmental problems they encounter & the support mechanisms they draw on to deal with them. Analysis reveals two types of worker -- independent & dependent -- with the latter facing more problems than the former. Neither, however, has their work recognized, & both have poor economic gains. Ways to uplift their status are suggested. 10 References. Modified AA

The Indecent Representation of Women (Protection) Act (1986)

Author: Gandhi, Nandita

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61539582?accountid=14925

Abstract: The historical background & implementation problems of the 1986 Indecent Representation of Women (Protection) Act in India are presented. It is concluded that state intervention has been inadequate in regulating pornographic materials, offensive advertisements, & other obscene representations of women; this may be due to the Act's vagueness. 5 References.

Beyond Social Service Administration

Author: Ramachandran, P11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61593800?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two viewpoints persist about the training of future social workers in the context of social change: one espousing perpetuation of the current system in India of training social workers for curative remedial social work; & the other favoring changing the system in order to train social workers for social action & reform. A transitionalist perspective is advocated that incorporates elements of both viewpoints, while encouraging promotional & holistic social work, in order to effect changes that will benefit society as a whole.

Voluntary Organisations and Women's Struggle for Change: Experience with BCT

Author: Vindhya, U1; Kalpana, V1 Dept Psychology & Parapsychology Andhra U, Visakhapatnam 530003 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61579600?accountid=14925

Abstract: An investigation of whether the widespread, development-oriented voluntary organizations in India subsume women's equality & rights. Programs in which the family is considered as a unit of development, & the inequality of women within the family is ignored, are described. Particular focus is on a case study of the Bhagavatula Charitable Trust (BCT), an organization formed in 1976 to assist the integrated development of 50 villages of Andhra Pradesh. In the remote village of Marripalem, BCT attempted to involve women in all developmental changes because it was perceived that they could be effective change agents in spite of their status in the caste & class structure. Utilizing an economic approach, the BCT model empowered the women to become vocal participants in community affairs & social change. 2 Tables, 19 References. V. Wagener

Repertoire of Interventions in the Field of Drug Abuse

Author: Nadkarni, Vimla V11 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61589525?accountid=14925

Abstract: Social workers & de-addiction workers need to be aware of the wide repertoire of interventions required to deal with the problem of drug addiction. A holistic response operates at both the microlevel, representing the interaction among the individual, the drug, & the environment, & the macrolevel of the social, economic, & political realities that predispose & perpetuate the problem. Although few social workers view the problem as structural, such an understanding is needed in order to influence macrolevel decision making. Various modalities of interventions are discussed along with influencing parameters, from helping addicts with their problem-solving capacities to working with governments in the development & improvement of social policies. 2 Figures, 7 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61587115?accountid=14925

Abstract: Today, the misuse & abuse of drugs is one of the world's most widespread & critical problems. As evidenced by the high rate of relapse, the expense, & the lack of an adequate number of professionals, compounded by the easy availability of drugs, medical treatment has not provided an affective answer to the problem. Possible drug abuse prevention strategies are considered. 1 Figure, 15 References. Modified HA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467565?accountid=14925

Abstract: Work with the families of drug addicts is examined in terms of (1) dealing with family pathology underlying addiction & the fostering of healthy interaction to smoothen the path to recovery, (2) helping the family to cope with the impact of addiction on the family, & (3) fostering family understanding of addiction & ensuring its contribution to the recovery of the addict. Focus is on the concept of "family power": ie, the family is viewed as the major unit providing strength & support for the addict through the process of treatment & rehabilitation, & one that can provide relief & support to itself as well as to other families in similar situations. 1 Figure, 12 References.

Rehabilitation in the Field of Drug Abuse

Author: Gandevia, Katy Y11 Dept Medical & Psychiatric Social Work Tata Instit Social Sciences, POB 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61589327?accountid=14925

Abstract: Various approaches, settings, & models used in the field of drug addict rehabilitation are outlined, including hospital detoxification programs & religious group membership. The experiences of Burma, Malaysia, & GB are described in order to provide a background for planning rehabilitation programs for drug addicts in India. In Burma, a month's stay in a detoxification center is followed, in selected cases, by several months in rehabilitation centers in which the client receives vocational training & psychotherapy. The Malaysian program emphasizes after care & a unique client management system. In GB, drug users are treated by community agencies that emphasize self-help. 7 References. Modified HA

Relationships among Task Complexity, Structure, Job Performance and Satisfaction in Social Service Organizations

Author: Dubey, Sumati N1; Meller, Yasef1 Jane Addams Coll Social Work U Illinois, Chicago 60680

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61437749?accountid=14925

Abstract: The relationship between task complexity & centralization/formalization, & its impact on job performance & satisfaction are examined in social service organizations that provide child welfare services, services to the elderly, employment counseling, & crisis intervention. Analysis is based on questionnaire data collected from a purposive systematic sample of 183 social workers & their immediate supervisors; organizational documents were also examined. Findings indicate that people-changing technologies were heterogeneous across different social service organizations & different programs within these organizations. Congruence between technology & organizational structure does not explain variance in job satisfaction & performance. 6 Tables, 37 References. Modified HA

Tribal Tradition and Modern Development in North-East India

Author: Burman, J. J. Roy11 Unit Social Policy Tata Instit Social Sciences, Deonar Bombay 400088 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61594974?accountid=14925

Abstract: The traditional socioeconomic institutions that characterize the tribal societies of northeastern India are usually regarded as impediments to modern development. However, many of the community-initiated autogenous growth processes are based on the very same institutions. Some state governments & voluntary agencies have begun to appreciate such institutions, & are encouraging the thrust of development through them. It is suggested that development workers must play a mediatory role between traditional & modern society, drawing on the experience base of the communities with which they work, & giving due consideration to new demands & aspirations. 5 References.

The Influence of Horizontal and Vertical Fragmentation on Social Welfare Policy: The Case of Israel

Author: Lazin, Frederick A11 Dept Behavioral Sciences Ben Gurion U Negev, Beersheva 84105 Israel

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61594123?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is often assumed that unitary political systems like Israel are better able to implement social policy than federal systems marked by political fragmentation. It is argued that Israel's unitary political system, despite its monopoly of authority, exhibits significant difficulties in the policy-making process, such as the constraints in the formulation of a single or even coordinated national policy in many substantive areas. To illustrate, an analysis of Project Renewal, the major social welfare & Ur renewal program of the Begin administration, shows how political institutions influence the establishment of administrative arrangements, the setting of priorities, the attainment of declared objectives, & the allocation of resources. 18 References.

Single Parent Families -- Consequences for Single Parents

Author: Bharat, Shalini11 Unit Family Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, Deonar Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470050?accountid=14925

Abstract: The economic, social, & emotional consequences for single-parent families in a slum area of Bombay, India, were examined via interview responses of 28 single parents & a comparison group of 28 intact-family mothers. Results show that the major problems were in the economic & emotional areas rather than in the social sphere. It is suggested that single-parent families be treated as high-risk families, & that welfare services be designed mainly to help them economically. 3 Tables, 5 References. Modified HA

Meditation Subculture and Social Skills

Author: Ganguli, H C11 Dept Psychology U Delhi, 110007 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61601569?accountid=14925

Abstract: Self-report questionnaire data are used to investigate the outcomes of an organized meditation program involving 230 young white Ms & Fs from Canada. Benefits reported by 66+% of participants (excluding those related to drug use) concern the nature of social skills & refer to improvement in coping skills & in social & interpersonal relatonships. It has been hypothesized that member interaction within the mediation group subculture, rather than the practice of the meditation exercise per se, is responsible for these social skills benefits. This hypothesis is supported by these results & those from small group studies. 3 Tables, 19 References. Modified HA

Aspirations of Decision-Makers for the Education of Girls, Bihar, 1980-81

Author: Kanitkar, Tara11 International Instit Population Sciences, Deonar Bombay 400088 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61578817?accountid=14925

Abstract: Analysis of 1981 Indian census data reveals that girls' education is neglected in various states, especially in Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, & Madhya Pradesh. Here, an attempt is made to study the aspirations of parents/decision makers in the family regarding girls' education in Bihar. Analysis of the data obtained during a survey of 10,721 households in 1980/81 indicates that the education aspired for girls is invariably lower than that for boys in Ru as well as in Ur areas. About 23% of Rs believe that girls should be given only the barest education, ie, to make them just literate. Differences in educational aspirations by caste, religion, & parental literacy/educational attainment are discussed. 6 Tables, 18 References. Modified HA

Abstract: The relation between the structure of professional social work in India & India's needs as a developing nation is discussed. It is argued that the problems faced by the social work profession arise from a discontinuity between Ru & Ur life.

Reaction to Authoritarian Leadership: A Projective Study

Abstract: A study is reported that used projective techniques to test the reactions of 221 Indian executives to authoritarian leadership situations. Results show that most Rs accept an authoritarian style of leadership. Such acceptance does not seem to be significantly influenced by age, type of organization, or managerial level. However, managers with high professional education were less favorably inclined toward authoritarianism. 11 Tables, 3 Appendixes, 23 References. Modified HA

The Impact of HIV/AIDS on the Food Consumption of Households

Author: Falleiro, Savio P1; Noronha, Silvia M1 Department of Economics, Rosary College of Commerce and Arts, Navelim, Goa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463025718?accountid=14925

Abstract: The paper explores the impact of HIV/AIDS on the food consumption pattern of households through empirical research and comparative analysis. The findings highlight that HIV/AIDS households are at a significant disadvantage despite spending a relatively greater proportion of household income on food. Unlike non-HIV/AIDS households, where female-headed-households were at a disadvantage, food-expenses are gender-neutral in HIV/AIDS households. These women make up their income disadvantage by depending significantly on 'partly/fully sponsored' food and 'unrequited and/or unrevealed' income. Adapted from the source document.

Sanitation Costs and Services in Selected Villages of Andhra Pradesh

Author: Snehalatha, M1; Reddy, Ratna, V; Jayakumar, N1 Country Coordinator

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463025704?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite a decade of the Total Sanitation Campaign 1 in India, sanitation still remains a big challenge. Findings from selected villages in Andhra Pradesh reveal that open defecation is rampant, and access to sanitation facilities is far from the reach of many households. Lack of space to construct toilets, availability of water, lack of awareness, and traditional practice of "open defecation" are the major constraints. The varied use of toilets across the Nirmal Gram Puraskar 2 and non-Nirmal Gram Puraskar villages indicate the intensive steps needed for demand generation. The solid and liquid disposal systems often receive low priority and the Panchayats do not receive sufficient money to tackle sanitation related issues. Cost data analysis reveal that capital costs take a lion's share of the funding, while planning and budgeting for indirect and direct support, and capital maintenance costs are negligible or missing. This paper argues for a life-cycle approach for funding with long term targeted efforts for behaviour change and higher allocations for sanitation. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring Patriarchy in Sex Workers' Intimate Relationships: A Case Study from Mumbai

Author: Karandikar, Sharvari; Frost, Caren

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463028722?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study compared perceptions of gender-based violence among female sex workers and male intimate partners of female sex workers in the Kamathipura red-light area of Mumbai, India. In-depth interviews with 13 female sex workers and 10 intimate partners of female sex workers revealed differences in perceptions of violence and sex work. While female sex workers reported severe violence from male members of the community, particularly their intimate partners, male members perceived their use of violence against their partners as a household issue. Male perceptions indicated patriarchal beliefs demonstrated by the need to control their female partners, and violence was used as a tool to exercise power over female bodies and behaviours. The study addresses a major gap in the literature on gender-based violence among sex workers of Kamathipura and makes recommendations for future practice, policy and research. Adapted from the source document.

Ethnic Cleansing, Displacement and Resettlement: Case of Bhutanese Refugees in Nepal

Author: Jacob, Mathew11 Currently working as a Senior Researcher with Human Rights Law Network, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463019280?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Bhutanese refugees came to the camps in Nepal around 18 years ago after they witnessed a brutal ethnic cleansing in Bhutan. They initially moved towards India seeking shelter and protection; however, for geo-political considerations, India failed to take any positive step to resolve the issue. Instead, she deported the refugees to Nepal, thereby indirectly supporting Bhutan's act of ethnic cleansing. The fight for repatriation has been diplomatically suppressed not only by India and Bhutan, but also by the inaction of the international community. Nepal did not have much to say on the matter either. Resettlement emerged as an option despite initial resistance from the refugees, especially the older ones, who considered repatriation as their only durable solution. However, political developments led to the failure of the realisation of repatriation and the emergence of resettlement in the third countries as the primary durable solution. Adapted from the source document.

Participation of Women in Panchayti Raj Institutions in Jammu and Kashmir

Author: Kumar, Ashwani11 Ashwani Kumar is a Research Scholar with the University of Jammu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463019284?accountid=14925

Abstract: Panchayati Raj Institutions had been largely dominated by men until the 73rd Amendment was passed in 1993 to ensure 33 percent reservation for women. However, the provisions of the 73rd Amendment were not extended to Jammu and Kashmir because of Article 370. Jammu and Kashmir has introduced 33 percent reservation in its halqa panchayats through the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj (Second Amendment) Act, 2003. In 2011, around 10,000 women were elected as panches through panchayat elections. In a state where the number of women in the party and electoral politics has been negligible, this is a process of great transformation. Adapted from the source document.

Feasibility of Introducing Jowar in Midday Meal Programmes: A Study in Three Regions of Andhra Pradesh

Author: Lakshmidevi, N1; Usharani, M; Umadevi, K; Kalpana, K1 Research Associate with the Department of Foods and Nutrition, Post Graduate and Research Centre

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463026159?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors conducted the study in three regions of Andhra Pradesh to evaluate the benefits of jowar (sorghum vulgare) on the growth and nutritional status of school children. The study sample covered six schools comprising 900 children selected from Anantapur (Rayalaseema), Mahbubnagar (Telangana) and Vizianagaram districts. The basic recipes selected for supplementation were standardised to meet one third of the daily calorie requirement for school going children. The results showed that the acceptability of jowar recipes was good and, therefore, could be considered for supplementation in the school Mid-day Meals programme of Andhra Pradesh. Adapted from the source document.

MICROCREDIT, CIVIC NETWORKS AND WOMEN'S POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT IN BANGLADESH

Author: UDDIN, MOHAMMAD JASIM11 Department of Sociology Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh mjauddin@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1622293156?accountid=14925

Abstract: The social capital school has proposed that one of the key mechanisms for generating good democratic outcomes is participation in voluntary associations. Of late, group-based microcredit programmes are considered as effective policy instruments for generating and strengthening civic networks of the community. However, on the micro-level we do not know enough about how membership in microcredit programmes promotes civic engagement, nurtures democratic learning process and makes their members more cooperative. In this paper I investigate whether microcredit providing NGOs have run through and nurtured democratic practices at the local level and whether they mobilize citizens politically and promote leadership among the women. The results indicate that microcredit organizations in the area that I studied failed to promote women's political capabilities or civic engagement since these organizations mainly concentrate on the services of credit distribution and installments collection, and have deviated or shifted away from community mobilization. Adapted from the source document.

Travelling Culture: The Role of Migration in Imaginative Construction of Culture

Author: Dwarak, Irina1; Leelaram, Sunanda1 Vedanta Cultural Foundation, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554261?accountid=14925

Abstract: The paper looks at the construction of culture in relation to the social phenomenon of migration. It focuses on the phenomenon of forced mass migration of Jewish students from the Russian Empire to Western Europe in the beginning of the 20th century. The paper views migration as the trigger for cultural, political and socioeconomic transformations among migrants. These transformations were brought about by a radical rethinking of homeland, nation, culture and identity and, as a result of which, a new powerful culture emerged. The paper describes culture as an imaginative construction. Culture is thus not a static and fixed entity contained within strictly defined boundaries of state, nation, religion, traditions and origin, but is subject to new definitions in changing socio-political contexts. Adapted from the source document.

The Determinants of First Birth Interval: The Misings of Assam

Author: Mahanta, Amarjyoti11 Department of Economics, Dibrugarh University, Assam

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1438554365?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explains the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of the first birth interval among the Misings, the second largest tribe of Assam. The findings of the multivariate regression analysis were significant when determining the effects of the wife's age at marriage, use of contraceptives, the educational level of the couple, family type, nature of wife's occupation and the income level on the first birth interval. Government intervention for socioeconomic progress can raise the quality of living and put restraints on population growth. Adapted from the source document.

Sexual Behaviour among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS In Gujarat: A Qualitative Study

Author: Patel, Sangita V1; Baxi, Rajendra K; Patel, Shilpa; Golin, Carol; Diwanji, Mansi; Shringarpure, Kalpita; Bakshi, Harsh N; Modi, Ekta; Conoor, Priyanka; Mehta, Kedar G1 UNC Sheps Center for Health Services Research, University of North Carolina, USA

Abstract: The authors conducted a formative study to adapt a US based intervention programme SAFETALK-"prevention with positives" to be culturally relevant in Gujarat. In-depth interviews for 30 People Living with HIV/AIDS selected from the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre in Vadodara, Gujarat, were conducted to assess their sexual behaviour and experiences. All female participants stated that they had been infected by their husbands; only few male participants were infected by their wives. The other male participants believed they had acquired HIV infection through their premarital or extramarital sexual relationships, or as a result of visiting commercial sex workers. Among participants with knowledge of condom use, this knowledge did not translate into practice, even among those who were also health workers. Reduction in sexual activity after HIV diagnosis was seen in majority of the cases. Adapted from the source document.

Perception of Sexual Harassment among Female Hotel Employees in Malaysia

Author: Alagappar, Ponmalar N1; David, Maya Khemlani; Rao, Ramesh1 Section for Co-curricular Courses, External Faculty Electives and TITAS (SKET)

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417521565?accountid=14925

Abstract: Malaysians from diverse ethnic backgrounds interpret verbal and nonverbal cues in relation to sexual harassment differently. This arises from differences in religious and socialisation practices despite a shared commonality of a Malaysian culture (Li and Lee-Wong, 2005). The study investigates perceptions of female hotel employees in Malaysia concerning sexual harassment. It explores how age, race, marital status, educational level, occupational position, department, and the number of years employed influence perception of sexual harassment. Understanding hotel employees' perceptions of sexual harassment will help managers prepare appropriate sexual harassment policies and know what areas of the issue to focus on during training and in the long run, help reduce sexual harassment lawsuits (Agrusa and others, 2002). Adapted from the source document.

Multiple Determinants of Quality Fathering Behaviours: An Exploratory Study of Father's Parenting Behaviours in Low-income Korean Families

Author: Moon, Hyukjun1; Seo, Sojung1 Department of Child and Family Studies, The Catholic University of Korea

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524261?accountid=14925

Abstract: Consistent with Belsky's (1984) theoretical model, the authors explored whether the contextual, paternal, and child characteristics would have cumulative effects on the quality fathering behaviours of young children. The 1164 participants were low-income Korean fathers of five-year-old children enrolled in 20 child care centers in Seoul, Korea. The results of the study supported Belsky's hypothesis that the effects of quality fathering behaviours were cumulative. Adapted from the source document.

Rashtriya Swasthya Beema Yojna: A Public Health Perspective

Author: Bajpai, Vikas1; Saraya, Anoop1 Research Scholar with the Centre for Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417523414?accountid=14925

Abstract: The latest insurance scheme, the 'Rastriya Swasthya Beema Yojna' is based on a business model that equally benefits all stakeholders. This paper analyses the scheme from the perspective of public health and political economy. Based on an analysis of the available data, the paper tries to burst the myth of the much eulogised technology of the Rastriya Swasthva Beema Yojna, which is out of sync with the social, economic and political context of poor people's lives and has grossly fallen short of the declared objectives. The access of this technology driven scheme is limited to the better off sections of society. Adapted from the source document.

Addressing the Issue of Disadvantaged Youth Seeking Work

Author: Hollywood, Emma1; Egdell, Valerie; McQuaid, Ronald1 Employment Research Institute, Edinburgh Napier University, United Kingdom

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524889?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the UK a significant number of young people do not make successful transitions into further education, training or employment on leaving school, which has been exacerbated further by the current economic crisis. Drawing on in-depth qualitative interview data, this paper examines two Third sector programmes in the UK that can be seen moving away from 'work-first' employment activation and focusing instead on promoting the individual capabilities of disadvantaged, unemployed youth in finding work. When this move is considered through a capability approach perspective, questions are raised about the voice of young people, as their aspirations can be limited because of the social contexts in which they live. It is argued that enabling unemployed youth to choose the work that they have reason to value cannot be achieved without taking into account the importance of the external context; and so while young people's choices may be developed through providing role models etc. it is still a choice shaped and restrained by the context of wider labour markets and education and training opportunities; and the personal and social barriers that inhibit young people from entering work.

Pedagogy Back on Track; Enhancing Capabilities for Young People in Education and Work

Author: Jensen, Niels Rosendal1; Kjeldsen, Christian Christrup1 Department of Education, Aarhus University, Denmark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417520749?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Danish case study presents findings and considerations derived from an empirical approach based on interviews with young persons, teachers and leaders of four participating institutions. The study discusses the official definition of the "target group" and points to structural and social circumstances. It further returns to an old idea of a "youth moratorium" as an alternate to the "work first"-agenda -- not least in the shape of "realistic counseling". The study shows how adaptations to market and to the "work first"-agenda seems to be counterproductive or even a negative conversion factor for the capability for work. The study points to "critical transitions", not only understood as "misleading trajectories", but as "coincidental trajectories", too. The study concludes in summing up the general problems. In addition the study invites to a discussion concerning pedagogy. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Sztandar-Sztanderska, Karolina1; Zielenska, Marianna1 University of Warsaw, Poland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524233?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article presents results of a case study of educational programme, which was designed to answer the structural problems of vocational schooling in Poland. It aimed at improving skills of students from vocational schools and was provided by a big employer operating in the sector of power industry. The analysis of empirical material consisting of interviews, documents, legal regulations and statistics, focused on identifying factors working in favour of building capabilities of its participants (increasing spectrum of their possible life choices). This particular case study gives insight into more general mechanisms contributing to the development of freedom of youth with low skills or impeding it by reproduction of inequalities. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This case study will focus on the institutional and normative framework of the German transition sector and one of its programmes -- namely 'Competence Agencies' -- its organisational forms and logics of action and the local context they operate in. Main questions will address their identification of problem groups and constructing 'troubled selves' and what they offer for young people in terms of capabilities for work, education and voice. The case study begins with a short framing of the resources, commodities and social policy agenda of the German transition sector and an illustration of the pedagogical programme (chapter 1). Basic research questions are outlined and the research methods are described (chapter 2). The modelling of the object of research embeds it analytically into the current social policy agenda (chapter 3). Three empirical findings are highlighted: Beginning with the questions of which pedagogical space is constituted and how 'caseness' is established, maintained and transformed, the aspects of identity work and institutional selves within these programmes are pointed out. The handling and negotiation of 'realistic perspectives' is a crucial point within this work and provides a link between an institutional and a subject-oriented level (chapter 4). The three capabilities for work, education and voice are the basis for an analytical review of the case study and the conclusion (chapter 5). Adapted from the source document.

From the Lisbon Strategy to Europe 2020: the Statistical Landscape of the Education and Training Objectives Through the Lens of the Capability Approach

Author: Vero, Josiane11 Centre d'Etudes et de Recherche sur les Qualifications, France

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417521074?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this chapter is to bring together and comment official statistics and indicators that make up educational targets that are increasingly favoured in the European Union Policy context from the Lisbon Strategy to the Europe 2020 strategy. Focusing on the call for making young people more employable, the chapter relies on Amartya Sen's Capability Approach and in particular on his key idea of 'informational basis of judgement' to reveal the postulates behind the benchmarks that assess progress toward the Education and Training Strategy. Taking up this plea, the chapter starts out by giving a brief description of the Lisbon Strategy as well as the Europe 2020 Strategy. In this perspective, it reports what progress in education and training -- or lack of it -- has taken place. The subsequent section introduces the concepts of "capability" and "Informational basis of judgement" derived from Amartya Sen's Capability Approach (CA) in order to shed light on the normative postulates underlying the benchmarks promoted by the European Commission. One main focus lies in addressing limitations of these indicators with the aim of providing a practical instrument with which to assess and compare education and training performance. The chapter concludes by offering some thoughts for an alternative set of indicators that employs insights from the capability approach drawn from the work of Amartya Sen.

Capabilities Without Rights? The Trespassing Project in Naples

Author: Bifulco, Lavinia1; Monteleone, Raffaele; Mozzana, Carlotta1 Universita di Milano-Bicocca, Italy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417525169?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to analyze a project for young NEET in southern Italy in terms of capabilities. Our objective is to examine to what extent it is possible to promote capabilities for work, for voice and for education in a context of lack of resources and rights as the one the project is rooted in. The paper focuses on the institutional, social and individual factors that hamper or promote the conversion of formal resources and rights into capabilities, and tries to understand what the outcomes are for beneficiaries. It highlights on the one hand the critical elements, and on the other the creation of innovative itineraries designed to promote such capabilities, trying to sum up lessons and indications in terms of policies, as well as theoretical and analytical implications for the capability approach. Adapted from the source document.

Regional Policies and Individual Capabilities: Drawing Lessons from two Experimental Programs Fighting Early School Leaving in France

Author: Berthet, Thierry1; Simon, Veronique1 Centre Emile Durkheim-Cereq, Universite de Bordeaux, France

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524149?accountid=14925

Abstract: This case study focuses on innovative regional policies fighting early school leaving (ESL) in two French regions, Aquitaine and Rhone-Alpes. After a short presentation of the French policy context on the topic of ESL, we present the two regional programs studied and draw a first line of general conclusions and findings on their implementation. In a second part, we assess these programs in terms of capabilities for voice, education and work. The general aim of the regional programs will thereby be confronted to the beneficiaries and teachers' point of views. Finally we will address the question of the non take-up of institutional devices such as the studied programs as a key question to a capability approach of public action.

Capabilities for Education, Work and Voice from the Perspective of "the Less Employable" University Graduates

Author: Bergstrom, Gunilla11 University of Gothenburg, Sweden

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417525042?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines how young university graduates with difficulties in finding a job corresponding to their education perceive their education in terms of capabilities for education, work and voice. Main methods used were interviews with a group of young graduates with a weak labour market attachment. The results indicate that the young graduates appreciate their education as an enhancing experience regarding capability for education and voice, but not for work. The conclusion drawn is that the main constraints stem from a lack of conversion factors related to the higher education system as well as the labour market-conversion factors that would enable the young graduates to convert available resources into capabilities for work. Adapted from the source document.

Dynamics of Educational Regimes and Capability-Oriented Research

Author: Atzmuller, Roland11 University of Linz, Austria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524525?accountid=14925

Abstract: The paper analyses the results of the WORKBABLE-project in relation to debates about educational regimes, which highlight the connections between different concepts of skill (general, firm specific, and occupational) and varied institutional settings of educational paths. The analysis focuses on emerging strategies to tackle to problems of a growing number of young people to succeed in the standard path of education. After an analysis of dynamics which are common to all regime-types (such as strategies of decentralization of educational processes etc.) and a rough overview over dynamics which vary between regimes a more detailed analysis of emerging variations to tackle the growing problems of VET in countries where the "dual system" dominates is offered. The paper contrasts the emergence of a transitory system in Germany, which rather serves a flexibilised labour market than to offer an adequate transition into VET; the regionalized emergence of programmes which aim to reintegrate the growing number of young unemployed who have to rely on social assistance into the standard path of the apprenticeships in companies; and the implementation of a complementary pillar in the Austrian VET-system based on a training guarantee agreed between the social partners and the government.

Methodological Issues in Operationalising the Capability Approach in Empirical Research: an Example of Cross-Country Research on Youth Unemployment in the EU

Author: Hollywood, Emma; Egdell, Valerie; McQuaid, Ronald; Michel-Schertges, Dirk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417524041?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper considers the experiences from nine in-depth case studies (undertaken as part of the "WorkAble" project) examining the transitions of (disadvantaged) young people: from compulsory school to further education; from education/vocational training to the labour market; and from unemployment/outside the labour market to employment. It considers two key issues related to using the Capability Approach as a central conceptual guide in the design of in-depth qualitative research. First, how to operationalise the Capability Approach in the methodology, an issue around which there is considerable debate in the literature in particular how to measure capabilities and which capabilities to measure. Second, how to conduct research that is comparable, but is also adaptable to the particular social and institutional contexts of the nine different nations. Specific issues related to the operationalisation of the Capability Approach, encountered when conducting the cross-country in-depth case studies, are highlighted; and debates from the capabilities literature discussed.

Introduction to the Case Studies

Author: Bifulco, Lavinia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417522084?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the following nine case-studies is to enhance understandings of successful ways in which to support young people who encounter difficulties, or who fail, in the 'standard' routes of education and the transition towards employment, by empowering their capabilities for voice, work and education. By applying the capability approach, we have elaborated a perspective which highlights: 1) The relation between freedom, education and work; 2) The relation between capabilities, the knowledge society and the future; and 3) The relation between capabilities, voice and democracy.

Counselling for Sustaining Quality of Life in Old Age: Introducing the German Research Project BELiA

Author: Pohlmann, Stefan1; Heinecker, Paula; Leopold, Christian1 University of Applied Sciences Munich, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417523768?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Germany, social advisory services provision is abundant but confusing. Complex service structure, insufficient transparency, and overlapping services cause access barriers, especially for older clients. A current research project aims to develop a new taxonomic system for existing advisory and counselling services to help older clients orientate in the service landscape. The specific needs of older clients also call for specific qualification of advisory and counselling professionals. The project focuses on standardized qualification for advisers, approaching the subject from a social gerontology point of view. A new training plan will provide basic gerontological competences and lead to a better understanding of the quality of life in old age. The empirical design consists of a quantitative online survey among service professionals (interim N=551), qualitative interviews of experts, service providers and users (N=162), focus groups (N=96), and observation of counselling sessions (N=30). The research project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to assess a Swiss s school-to-work transition programme against the capability approach. Our objective is to examine to what extent it enhances youngsters' capabilities by providing resources and conversion factors allowing them to project themselves in the future and plan their own life in a way they have reason to value. The impact of the programme is assessed with regard to its beneficiaries' capability for voice, for education and for work. The paper answers the three following research questions: What is the impact of the individualised approach promoted by the programme on the recipients' capability for voice? How does the programme integrate a life course perspective and to what extent does it take into account the beneficiaries' capacity to aspire? What is the impact of the programme on the supply and demand sides of the labour market? Adapted from the source document.

A Comparative Comment on the Case Studies

Author: Kjeldsen, Christian Christrup1; Ley, Thomas; Jensen, Niels Rosendal; Otto, Hans-Uwe1 Department of Education, Aarhus University, Denmark

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1417525141?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper brings up some central aspects from the case studies and brings them briefly together within an analytical and heuristic framework of the capability approach. We argue that the Capabilities for Education, Work and Voice should be considered as the main fertile capabilities in the studied domain. These three theoretically and empirically driven concepts are addressed one by one. At the end we broaden this further with the awareness that these capabilities have to be understood in their relational dependencies, conditions and consequences as well as in relation to the contextual differences they operate within. Hence, the mentioned set of capabilities is regarded as an important relational frame that can "enable young people to act as capable citizens in European societies" (according to the WorkAble objective), and besides of that it can be used as an evaluative framework raising questions which social and institutional conditions are necessary for young adults. Adapted from the source document.

Child Adoption Patterns among Childless Couples: Evidence from Rural Andhra Pradesh

Author: Unisa, Sayeed1; Pujari, Sucharita; Ganguly, Sujata1 Department of Mathematical Demography and Statistics, International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347786174?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is an attempt to understand the child adoption patterns among childless women and the way they cope with the situation. The data comes from a large scale community based study on the socio-psychological consequences of childlessness conducted in the Ranga Reddy district of Andhra Pradesh from 1996-2000. Results show that the age of women, allopathic treatment and child adoption have a positive association. The number of adoptions among primary infertile couples is twice that of secondary infertile couples. Adoptions within intact families are common and most couples are happy and satisfied after adopting a child. Adapted from the source document.

Impact of an Economic Crisis on the Lifestyle of Families in Ankara

Author: Boylu, Ayfer Aydiner1; Oztop, Hulya; Terzioglu, R Gunsel1 Department of Family and Consumer Sciences, Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347786197?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the impact of the economic crisis that occurred in Turkey in late 2008. Chi-square analysis was used for data analysis. The findings from the sample study of 600 families revealed that economic crises caused decline in family income and savings, increase in indebtedness, cutting down on expenses of necessary and compulsory requirements like food and clothing, and loss of various stocks and properties, especially gold. This has caused deterioration of relationships within closed environments and decline in social activities. Adapted from the source document.

An Exploration into Premarital Expectations of Youth across Gender

Author: Lavalekar, Anagha1; Jagtap, Pranita1 Research Associate

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347786202?accountid=14925

Abstract: A decision regarding marriage is a crucial, life-changing experience. This study reveals the expectations of today's youth and the gender differences regarding marital partners and marital life. A sample of 135 youth aged 20-35 years was selected for the study. The analysis indicates that there is an increasing trend towards openness in choice of partners. Emotional bonding between partners is of paramount importance. Quality time is valued more than mere quantity of time spent with each other. Marriage is perceived as a commitment to family-not just to a single person-but at the same time independence in daily matters is a major criteria for fulfillment whether one is staying in a joint household, or not. Significant gender differences were observed in expectations about financial and sexual matters. Adapted from the source document.

Problems in the Study of Man and the Shifting Borders of Caste

Author: Cybil, K V11 Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1347786207?accountid=14925

Abstract: In his article published posthumously M.N.Srinivas (2003) wrote that, caste has changed its form in post-colonial India. He argued that the disintegration of the jajmani system in the villages has resulted in the liquidation of caste as a system. Nonetheless its continuation in other forms has been ensured by other institutions that emerged after Independence in the country. The most important of these is democracy and related practices, which has ensured that members of different castes get themselves organised into caste based organisations to ensure effective participation in the new political machinery of the post-colonial state. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1504420882?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper seeks to examine some of the key issues relating to outcome budgeting in India. It begins with a discussion on the genesis of outcome budgeting in the country and goes on to highlight some of the major weaknesses observed in the current practice across Union and State governments. Some of the major problems witnessed in the process of utilisation of budget outlays, particularly those meant for social sector programmes/schemes have been outlined. Besides, this paper also tries to identify some of the major planning and policy bottlenecks which could be resulting in the problems witnessed in utilisation of budget outlays by states. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Community mental health care services have been developing in Western countries for decades and have been proved to be effective in facilitating the rehabilitation of people with mental illness into the community in many evidence-based research studies. In Hong Kong, with the support of the government and non-government organisations, community mental health care services have been set up in different districts since 2005. However, research on the services is limited. By using the one-group pre-test and post-test design method, this study examines the effects of one Community Mental Health Care Services on the rehabilitation of people with mental illness discharged from hospitals. A total number of 120 service users participated in the study and 87 subjects completed all the assessments in different areas, including psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, self-efficacy and community living skills, before the commencement of intervention, 6 months after the intervention and at 12 months immediately after the intervention. Results showed that the subjects had lessened psychiatric symptoms (p<.001), better quality of life (p<.05), enhanced self-efficacy (p<.001) and increased community living skills (p<.001), after the services. The study revealed significant positive effects of the community mental health care services on people with mental illness in the community. Adapted from the source document.

Use of Strengths Perspective to Treat Persons Suffering from Mental Illness in India: A Case Analysis

Author: Jaganathan, Aarti1; K., Sekar1 Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samasthana, Bangalore, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037876706?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over the past few years, some practicing psychiatric social workers in India are adopting the strengths-based perspective in the case management of people suffering from mental illness. This paper illustrates and analyses a case report depicting the benefits and challenges of a strengths based perspective in psychiatric social work intervention in India. The authors also discuss how familial and cultural mores, beliefs and rituals, can act both as strengths and threats in working with clients. Adapted from the source document.

A Study of Young Adults who Attempted Suicide in Turkey

Author: Alptekin, Kamil1; Duyen, Veli1 Duzce University, Turkey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1037876781?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study was conducted with the aim of gaining an integrated and comprehensive psychosocial understanding of the behaviours of young adults, who were brought to the emergency service unit of a hospital after they had attempted suicide. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data from 21 individuals. Most studies conducted earlier have attributed suicide attempts to problems encountered in relationships with the opposite sex. However, the findings of this study indicate that suicide attempts are largely a result of the individual's inability to face or cope with difficult situations and the ability to solve his/her problems. Adapted from the source document.

Islamic Activism: Anti-Apostasy Propaganda in the Lina Joy Case

Author: David, Maya Khemlani1; Yoong Soon Chye, David1 Section for Co-curricular Courses, External Faculty Electives and TITAS (SKET), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714107?accountid=14925

Abstract: In early 2007, the court case of Lina Joy's conversion from Islam to Christianity was under both the local and international media spotlight because the case brought into the forefront the question whether a Malaysian Malay has the constitutional right to choose her religion, as well as marry a non-Muslim (Koshy 2007). Conservative Malay Muslims claimed that Joy, being a person of Malay heritage, threatened the Malay identity because the Federal Constitution states that a Malay has to be a Muslim. This research analyses the techniques used by PEMBELA, an Islamic activist group comprising more than seventy Islamic Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), to push their cause and solicit support from Muslims to oppose Joy's claims. Jowett and O'Donnell's (2005) content analysis is used to study the leaflet distributed by PEMBELA. Adapted from the source document.

Making TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) Textbooks LGBT Inclusive

Author: Ghajarieh, Amir B B1; Cheng, Karen Kow Yip1 Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, University of Malaya

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714119?accountid=14925

Abstract: Inspired by Thornbury's 1999 article on the issue of marginalisation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual (LGBT) community in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) textbooks, the author investigates the representations of people with different sexual orientations and gender identities in Iranian EFL secondary textbooks produced by Iranian authors. Three textbooks were examined to determine the frequency with which LGBT characters appeared in the illustrations. The data revealed an absence of LGBT representations in the content of these educational materials, although many other forms of same-sex relationships were represented in the illustrations. Same-sex portrayals relate to non-sexual relationships such as female friendships, male friendships, and family relations. The depictions of same-sex relationships could be linked to the gender segregation system existent in many Islamic countries, including Iran. The findings reflect the influence of religious and cultural reservations in excluding people of different sexual orientations and gender identities in EFL materials. Adapted from the source document.

Criminal Investigation and Proceedings of Juvenile Delinquency in Iran

Author: Heidari, Masoud11 Faculty of Law, Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan Branch, Esfahan, Iran masoud_heidari2@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714147?accountid=14925

Abstract: Society needs to frame a separate proceeding system for juvenile delinquents. Methods of dealing with juvenile delinquents from early detection of crime to application of specific penal actions are significantly different from those employed with adult criminals. A quarter of Iran's population consists of individuals below the age of fifteen. Absence of proper legal regulations and procedures for handling episodes of delinquency has given rise to several problems in the courts of Iran. This study briefly examines the different stages of investigations and the major characteristics of the proceedings of juvenile and adolescent delinquencies and makes a few recommendations for improving the system. A number of questionnaires were prepared to evaluate the efficacy of the recommendations. Each recommendation was assessed by 30 jurists. The results highlight the need for a thorough examination of the existing criminal proceeding system. Implementation of the suggested interventions and strategies would lead to about 80% resolution of the existing problems concerning the proceedings of juvenile delinquencies at judicial courts. Adapted from the source document.

Bildungsroman: A Study of Pain and Poverty in K.A. Gunasekaran's 'The Scar'

Author: Bharathiraja, S11 Department of English, Annamalai University, Tamil Nadu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/925714157?accountid=14925

Abstract: Dalit autobiographies portray struggles, atrocities and caste consciousness existing in an orthodox Indian society. K.A. Gunasekaran hails from the Dalit community, formerly considered as 'Untouchables' in India. As a Dalit, he had experienced discrimination and exploitation at various levels-physical and psychological. His education and self-determination to overcome all forms of discrimination motivated him to experience life beyond the limitations imposed upon him by his birth. Adapted from the source document.

Why Do We Think Practice Research is a Good Idea? Comments and Musings Inspired by the Salisbury Statement

Author: Witkin, Stanley L11 University of Vermont switkin@uvm.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498590?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this paper I raise some questions about current understandings of practice research and whether they are worth pursuing. In particular, the notion of a gap between practice and research is examined in terms of how it constricts thinking about this issue. I also attempt to explicate some of the less examined assumptions associated with practice research. Finally, I suggest that we embrace multiplicity, not by trying to accommodate all views under the practice research umbrella, but by accepting that there will be many versions of practice research that will have differential appeal. Adapted from the source document.

The Making of the First Child Welfare and Juvenile Crime Acts in Finland 1897-1943

Author: Harrikari, Timo11 Department of Social Studies, University of Helsinki timo.harrikari@helsinki.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633480?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes procedures leading to the establishing of the first Finnish Child Welfare Act (1936) and Juvenile Crime legislation (1940 -- 43) during the first years of the 20th century. More particularly, this article discusses the changing interpretations of and societal reactions to juvenile crime as part of governing the minors. The first Nordic child welfare acts were enacted in Norway in 1896, Sweden in 1902 and Denmark in 1905. Finland was a late-comer. Even though similar efforts emerged at the turn of the 20th century in Finland, the first child welfare act was enacted as late as in 1936 and the first Juvenile Crime Act in 1940. Thus, the making of the first child welfare act, and furthermore, the first juvenile crime act, took nearly forty years, from the very first parliamentary motion represented in 1897 to the final drafts in 1936 and 1940. During this period, child welfare and juvenile crime discourses and doctrines changed and the actors of the legislative processes varied. This article analyses the types of discursive changes that emerged within these legislative processes and asks why the child welfare and juvenile crime acts finally became what they are. Thus, the applied description is a historical and political analysis where the questions of childhood, youth, child welfare and juvenile crime are structured and restructured within the space of the constitutional state. Adapted from the source document.

Children's Participation and Citizenship in a Global Age. Empowerment, Tokenism or Discriminatory Disciplining?

Author: Warming, Hanne11 Department of Society and Globalization, Roskilde University rhannew@ruc.dk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498615?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article explores children's participation and citizenship, taking its point of departure in the empirical observation of a paradox: On the hand there is a general participatory climate and a growing commitment to empowerment of children, and on the other hand some children's experience of discrimination, disciplining and distrust. The analysis is structured into three main parts: 1) Participation, approached from Hart's Ladder of Participation and Bourdieu's theorizing of power dynamics; 2) Rights, using Marshall's tripartite conceptualization, namely civil rights, political rights and social rights, supplemented by a discussion of the right to care and cultural rights; and 3) Identity, theorized using Delanty's conceptualization of citizenship as a learning process The article concludes that children's citizenship, and the initiatives that are accounted for as facilitating their well being and participation though social work, too often tend towards tokenism if not discriminatory disciplining and exclusion, rather than empowerment, due to political, organisational and discursively shaped power relations.

Alternative Care for Children in Botswana: a Reality or Idealism?

Author: Malinga, Tumani1; Ntshwarang, Poloko N1 University of Botswana, Department of Social Work malingat@mopipi.ub.bw

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633495?accountid=14925

Abstract: The world is experiencing an increase in the numbers of children requiring care, and Botswana is no exception. There are various alternative methods used to aid vulnerable children (VC). Formal alternative care giving arrangements for children in need of care include residential care, formal adoption and guardianship sanctioned by the courts. Historically, kinship care was used to address the needs of vulnerable children. However, African societies, including Botswana are going through a process of rapid social, economic, and cultural change and families are living under extreme poverty, and finding it difficult to extend help to other relatives. Even though some alternative methods are available, there is need for them to be revisited to examine whether the best interests of the child are met. This article explores the alternative care methods for children in Botswana. It looks at the method's strengths and challenges. Supporting vulnerable children is critical to the future of sub-Saharan Africa and urgent action is essential. The paper discusses the implications of the methods of alternative care and calls for community, national, and international responses. It also argues for the need for technical and financial resources to critically address the escalating needs of the country's vulnerable children. Adapted from the source document.

Women's Experience of Poverty in Context of Power Inequality and Financial Abuse in Intimate Relationship

Author: Broza-Grabowska, Paulina11 University of Warmia and Mazury Olsztyn paulinabroza@tlen.pl

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1010633497?accountid=14925

Abstract: Poverty is one of the major problems in Poland. According to the statutory border of poverty, there are about 7.3% people who are poor (Poverty in Poland 2010). It is not surprising then that many researchers are preoccupied with this problem. Today, a lot of quantitative research is conducted by institutions like OBOP and GUS (J. Bielec 2007; Baczewski 2008; Deniszczuk 2007). Also, qualitative studies are carried out (Tarkowska, 2000; Warzywoda-Kruszyska 2001; Golczyska-Grondas 2004; Nalaskowski-2007; Zabielska 2007). I intend to join a group of researchers investigating the problem of poverty through qualitative approaches in order to discover how poverty affects women and how they deal with it. It is interesting that the studies on poverty view the entire household as the unit of analysis. Feminist-oriented researchers discovered that the distribution of wealth in the family is not equal and investigating poverty should focus on individuals rather than entire households (see Daly 1989). So, in my project I would like to focus on private, personal experiences of women experiencing poverty rather than on entire households. Adapted from the source document.

Greek Pre-Primary Education From the Perspective of Capability Approach: Beliefs and Practices of Pre-Primary Teachers

Author: Potsi, Antoanneta11 Research School "Education and Capabilities", Bielefeld University janissa.miettinen@uef.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887500484?accountid=14925

Abstract: Greece's educational indicators lag behind those of other OECD countries. Educational attainment in most age groups is below the OECD average. PISA results are low and the resources devoted to education are also below par. Participation rates in early childhood education and care are low, reflecting poor supply and quality problems as well as social preferences for home care. PISA scores as well as the OECD reports concerning Greece have influenced the Greek educational policy measures that have been initiated with respect to the entire spectrum of the educational levels, including the pre-primary education. Among these measures, the curriculum reform (2002) consists of a measure that was intensely criticized (Kitsaras, 2004, Chrysafidis, 2004). The curriculum outlines the directions for programmes regarding planning and development of activities in the context of the following subjects: Language, Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Creation and Expression (through Fine Arts, Drama, Music, Physical Education), Computer Science. However, we can not estimate which aspects of the curriculum are implemented because of the lack of assessment regarding teachers' practices. Assessment is referred to in the curriculum but only with respect to children's performance. Beliefs are a major influence on classroom decisions (Fang, 1996) and pre-primary school teachers make a myriad of decisions that affect the child's personality and development. Pajares (1992) in his effort to clarify the difference between knowledge and beliefs highlights that knowledge systems are open to evaluation and critical examination while beliefs are not. Teachers' implicit theories about the nature of knowledge acquisition can affect teacher behavior and ultimately student learning (Fang, 1996). Therefore, it is imperative to identify teachers' beliefs so that we could estimate what impact beliefs have on the every day educational procedure in the pre-primary school.

Vocational Opportunities of Unemployed Young Adults

Author: Rebbe, Daniel11 Universitat Bielefeld daniel.rebbe@uni-bielefeld.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887500486?accountid=14925

Abstract: This PhD thesis is about the unequal chances and opportunities in the life of young unemployed people in Germany and their transitions into the labour market. Adolescents and young adults under the age of 25 are highly affected by the lack of apprenticeships and unemployment (cf. ILO 2010). Their chances to get an apprenticeship and subsequent employment according to their preferences and/or choice seem to be considerably depending on their socio-economical status and social backgrounds. An increasing rate of "not unemployed" young people, who do not find an apprenticeship or a suitable employment, are situated in a complex transitional system that offers a broad variety of temporary bridging measures for vocational training and vocational orientation (cf. Bosch et al. 2010). Furthermore, the German labour market shows a vast increase of loan jobs and short term employments, implicating a tendency change from normal to precarious and atypical employments (cf. AAW 2009, p.111ff.). Adapted from the source document.

The Prerequisites of Success in Child Welfare Open Care

Author: Miettinen, Janissa11 University of Eastern Finland janissa.miettinen@uef.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887496789?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study focuses on the prerequisites of success in child welfare open care in Finland from a probabilistic view. The aim of this research is to supplement the knowledge base and conceptual understanding of the factors and mechanisms contributing to the success in child welfare open care and by this to contribute to the improvement of the effectiveness of open care (Weiss 1998, 4). The main research question is: What are the critical factors that (probably) promote or inhibit the enhancement of the life situation of an under twelve year old child receiving support in child welfare open care and through what kinds of mechanisms do these factors (probably) impact to the outcomes? Adapted from the source document.

Collaborating or Colluding: A Practice Research Project with Ex-Offenders and their Families in Singapore

Author: Sim, Timothy11 Hong Kong Polytechnic University timothysim@yahoo.com.sg

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498604?accountid=14925

Abstract: Working with the family members of ex-offenders is a daunting and newly developing aspect of offender rehabilitation in Singapore. A small scale practice research project was carried out by three social work practitioners and two academics over a period of 22 months, with the aim to explore the pertinent issues and challenges in working with family members of ex-offenders. Systematic documentation of the process of working with three cases was carried out. Specific skills and strategies were suggested, and recommendations for changes to service delivery and policy for working with ex-offenders and family members were made to the authorities. This article highlights the enriching journey of collaboration between the academics and practitioners. Adapted from the source document.

Practice Literate Research: Turning the Tables

Author: Fisher, Mike11 Social Care Institute for Excellence mike.fisher@scie.org.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887498593?accountid=14925

Abstract: Researchers complain how difficult it is to get practitioners and policymakers to use research. In contrast, this paper looks at the issues from the perspective of practice, and argues that it is the researcher's job to become more practice-literate, so that research begins with practice concerns and develops practice-based solutions. The paper explores the relationship between research and practice and suggests that research has insufficiently engaged with the nature of practice and practice knowledge. Using the Salisbury Statement on practice research (Salisbury Statement 2010) the paper offers a definition of practice research and analyses what would be required for an agenda for practice research. Finally the paper proposes five functions for practice research. Adapted from the source document.

I Would Tell No One Because It Is for Me to Know... No One! Whom Do Out-of-School Youth Talk to About Decisions Regarding Voluntary Counselling and Testing?

Author: Francis, Dennis11 Faculty of Education, University of Free State, South Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/914767489?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article arises out of research conducted with out-of-school youth in the Shongweni area and explores whom they would involve when making decisions about seeking Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT). Four out-of-school youths, trained as peer researchers, interviewed 32 other out-of-school youths in the Shongweni area of KwaZulu-Natal in order to explore who they talked to about VCT, as well as who they did not. A single method of data collection, structured interviews, was used. Gossip and lack of trust among friends emerged as barriers to youth seeking VCT. As a result, friends were the least likely to be told about or involved in decisions regarding VCT. Somewhat more likely were sex partners, and most likely family members, who were seen as most trustworthy. Even though they were more trusted than friends, partners were not likely to be told VCT results. This revealed high levels of stigma and prejudice which still surrounded HIV/AIDS and VCT in this community. This translated into a lack of trust among friends and suspicions about fidelity in love relationships, which both negatively affected openness about VCT. However, families -- in particular mothers -- were trusted and involved in decision-making. This highlights a shift in how families are used as sites of coping in the crisis of HIV/AIDS as well as the potential for building on these relationships as a network of support. Adapted from the source document.

SHGs and Women Empowerment: What Colour and What Form

Author: Prasanthi, P1; Padma, A1 State Resource Person, Andhra Pradesh Mahila Samatha Society (APMSS), Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881469622?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the late 1990s, SHGs as a concept had taken the shape of a movement in Andhra Pradesh (AP). Today, it has become an integral part of all development programmes. A decade ago, cooperatives-which had evolved as institutions for self-help among common interest groups-played a major role in development across all sectors. Gradually, with the changing national and developmental scenario, SHGs emerged as institutions for thrift and credit. Though the SHG is not defined as a women's group, it started with women coming together to access and repay loans as a collective. Today, SHGs have become an acronym for women's groups and a model for women's empowerment in AP. This article is based on the field experiences of the authors and traces the emergence of the SHG as a concept and observes that cooperatives are not a practical model for taking credit services to the rural poor, especially women. Further, this article also attempts to critically examine the concepts of sanghams promoted by the Mahila Samakhya Programmes of the Government of India. Adapted from the source document.

Women Empowerment through the SHG Approach: The Kudumbashree Model

Author: Augustine, Dijo1; Kumar, Minu M1 Labour Welfare Officer, Harrisons Malayalam Ltd., Idukki, Kerala

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881467273?accountid=14925

Abstract: Kudumbashree, the poverty alleviation programme, was launched by the State Government of Kerala on April 1, 1999. This programme views women empowerment as the key to bring families out the poverty trap. Offering microcredit through self-help was considered as the best means to achieve this goal. This article observes the women-centred activities of Kudumbashree and the impact it has had on their empowerment. Members of neighbourhood groups of this programme believe that women are, in most cases, affected by income disparity and poverty among families. Hence, it tries to reach out to the community through families and women. This article tries to analyse these aspects of the programme. The article is based on the experiences of the two authors who worked as voluntary executives of Kudumbashree during the first two semesters of their Master's programme in Social Work. This was part of their fieldwork programme with the District Mission of Ernakulam. Adapted from the source document.

Use of Communication by SHGs for Empowerment of Women

Author: Murthy, D.V.R.1; Haranath, S; Arjun, P1 Department of Journalism

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/881467284?accountid=14925

Abstract: It has been observed that communication facilitates social change while empowering the disadvantaged sections of the population. In fact, communication inputs have been increasingly used in various developmental initiatives or programmes. In this article, the authors have attempted to examine the role of communication in the empowerment of SHG members from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. In recent years, women-run SHGs have become accelerators of change and empowerment. By being present at SHG meetings, the authors observed the nature of participation that includes the five approaches of communication adopted to strengthen relationships among group members. These approaches are: a two-step flow of communication, dialogue, SHG sammelan (congregation), community lunch, and entertainment-education programmes. The present article analyses how these five approaches have facilitated change among SHG women members and how it has empowered them. Adapted from the source document.

Perceived Prevalence, Determinants and Preventive Strategies for Violence-Related Behaviours Among South African High School Children: A Survey Among Teachers in Rural Vhembe District

Author: Akinsola, H A1; Ramakuela, N J1 School of Health Sciences, Department of Public Health, Thohoyandou, South Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856407086?accountid=14925

Abstract: The trend in violent acts in South African schools since independence has shown a steady rise, and the situation only continues to get worse. The litany of violent crimes in schools in the recent past alone is a sign that the situation is not abating. For example, in the past months, many students and other individuals have either been seriously injured or murdered by other students. The study seeks to determine teachers' perceived prevalence, determinants and preventive strategies for interpersonal violent behaviour in secondary schools within Vhembe District. The study uses a quantitative cross-sectional design and all the teachers in the 10 randomly selected schools were eligible to participate in the study. The instrument of data collection was a questionnaire and the data was analysed descriptively using the SPSS. The study showed that the causes of violent behaviour in the schools included in the study are multi-faceted and, therefore, the strategies to address the problem must also operate at a variety of levels. Adapted from the source document.

A Comparative Study of Livelihood Strategies in Rural and Urban Assam

Author: Bhattacharjee, Mahua11 Amity School of Economics, Amity University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856407045?accountid=14925

Abstract: Livelihood strategies of rural and urban Assam are becoming more interdependent. The rural-urban linkage is influencing livelihood in both positive and negative ways as market forces are increasingly determining all livelihood strategies. The study reveals that the working population unanimously consider that livelihood is not as easy as it was for the previous generation. Factors like unsuitable weather for cultivation, price fluctuation, competition from better/cheap/substitute products, and the reluctant attitude of the younger generation towards rural livelihood activities are mainly responsible for making livelihoods harder. Products with a variety in different price ranges have brought significant changes primarily in rural livelihood activities. Sustainability of livelihood is now more dependent on practicing diversification as it compels households to be more vigilant and adopt the change occurring over time. Adapted from the source document.

An Evaluation Study of NSS in India

Author: Parasuraman, S1; Ahmed, Khalil; Afroz, Saman; Chitturu, Saigita1 Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/856405920?accountid=14925

Abstract: The National Service Scheme-Training Orientation and Research Centre of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, conducted an evaluation study of the National Service Scheme (NSS) in India for the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Government of India, in 2008. The study reviewed four aspects of the Scheme across five states and one Union Territory of India: nature and spread of activities, its impact and sustainability; administrative and financial mechanism; and training and motivational aspects. All the stakeholders in the NSS-right from students to the officials in the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports-were interviewed. The total number of respondents interviewed was 1,363. The findings of the study revealed some fascinating insights about each of the aspects evaluated. Though the Scheme is being implemented for the last 40 years, it still has several lacunae which are mostly due to the lack of strong administrative mechanism, lack of innovative activities, financial constraints, and poorly motivated people running the scheme. The recommendations emerging from these findings may be used to bring about further changes to rejuvenate and strengthen the NSS in India. Adapted from the source document.

The Socioeconomic Correlates of Child Work in India

Author: Gaur, Kirti11 International Instit for Population Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/818793998?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study focuses on the prevalence & correlates of child work in selected states of India by utilising the 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey data. Results show that every eighth child aged 5-14 years is engaged in work in India. Further, the duration of work by children aged 5-11 years is two & a half hours, & that of older children (12-14 years) is six hours in a day. The study provides ample evidence to state that chances of work participation increases to almost double when children are not attending school. The findings also suggest that child work is positively associated with social, economic & familial disadvantages. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The article explores the lives of disabled persons with a brief historical preview of the information available on disabled persons in India. By analysing various rounds of the decennial Indian census data sets, the article highlights the positive relationship of age & disability. India is ageing rapidly, with the result that the magnitude of disabled persons are also likely to increase. The article suggests preventive & curative/advocacy measure to reduce the magnitude of disability. Adapted from the source document.

Myths about Sex and Sexuality: Need for Sex Education

Author: Agarwal, Manju11 Amity Instit Behavioral & Allied Sciences, Amith U, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/818793242?accountid=14925

Abstract: For some time now, there has been a lot of debate on imparting sex education to adolescents in India. According to a powerful section of society, sex education will corrupt the minds of young people & will promote sexual act before marriage. Contrary to this belief, the present study on rural adolescent girls showed that girls become a prey to incest, rape, unwedded pregnancies & low self-esteem due to lack of sex education & relevant information about sexuality & reproduction. The study strongly advocates the need for sex education to understand the femininity & masculinity of sexuality, myths, misconceptions, questions & anxieties related to it. The sample consisted of 86 adolescent girls, 23 close relatives of these girls, & 31 community-based workers. Interviews, semi-projective tests, focus group discussions, & cognitive mapping, among others, were used to understand the psychosocial world of adolescent girls. Adapted from the source document.

Financial Security Protections In Malaysia, Singapore And Philippines: A Perspective Of Two Generations

Author: Mohd, Saidatulakmal1; Azman, Azlinda; Sulaiman, Jamalludin; Baba, Ismail1 School of Social Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887497096?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study investigated the formal and informal old age protections in the major cities of Malaysia, Singapore and Philippines. The role of family support as important source of old-age protection in Asian countries was also investigated. Data were collected using a survey-interview method. A total of 250 young population and 250 of the elderly population in Kuala Lumpur were interviewed. Similar number of young and elderly population was interviewed in Manila. In Singapore, data was collected from 206 and 161 young and elderly population respectively. A Venn diagram was constructed to analyse the overlapping of availability of the various old age protections for the two generations and their relative sizes among the three cities were compared. Given the many agreement on the inadequacy of the formal old-age benefits, many reverted to informal protections such as insurance, savings and family support. With the exception of Manila, reliance on the family support as perceived by the younger generations has lost its importance. Adapted from the source document.

Contemporary Issues And Challenges In Poverty: A Case Study Of Malaysia

Author: Azman, Azlinda1; Sulaiman, Jamalludin; Mohd, Saidatulakmal; Baba, Ismail1 School of Social Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia azlindaa@usm.my

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/887497124?accountid=14925

Abstract: Poverty in Malaysia has decreased significantly from a relative high of more than 50% before independence in 1957 to less than 10% today. The incidence of hardcore or the absolute poor is less than 1%, according to official statistics in 2007. And, it is Malaysia's aim to achieve zero absolute poverty by 2015. However, the rate of poverty reduction based on recent data appears to have slowed down beginning the mid 1990s. The slowdown in poverty reduction raises serious concern as this affects the well-being of this disadvantaged group of population. Generally, the poor in Malaysia are the aged households, female and live in the rural areas. Several studies conducted in 2007-2008 identified several issues relating to poverty in the country. This paper will analyse some of the issues and suggest practical solutions that will benefit the poor population. Adapted from the source document.

The Paradox of Self-Determination for Marginalized Individuals

Author: Green, Denise M11 Troy University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114062?accountid=14925

Abstract: Self-determination is a Sine Qua Non of human rights. The ability to make choices concerning the development and direction of life should be the right of all human beings; however, the simplicity of this statement does little to embrace the reality in which this seed is planted. While the right to self-determination is insisted upon, debated, regulated, denied, and enforced in international politics, nation rights, states' rights, and individual rights, the elements necessary to be self-determined remain less apparent. Self-determination is a complex construct consisting of self-directed behaviors and environmental influences not accessible to all people. It becomes the paradox of those marginalized individuals seeking to be self-determinant by the very act of demanding or choosing, will often be further marginalize and excluded, enclosing them into a never ending cycle of social exile. The right to make choices is proposed as the cornerstone of self-determination. The extent of what those choices are varies as seen in different definitions concerning self-determination. Stancliffe, Abery, & Smith (2000), present a militaristic and self indulgent definition of self-determination, stating "the degree of control that individuals have over their lives, including areas they value and wish to exert personal control over; in other words, self-determination implies absolute control over what happens to the individual" (p . 432) It is this absolute issue of control over life and death that individuals may use to exert their will on others as they are further removed from the social group. This form of self-determination is often seen in terroristic activities. E. L. Deci (1997), an early author of the psychology of self-determination purposes self-determination and free will are homogeneous constructs, further developing and supporting the relationship of power and right. Webster (1993) addresses within its definition of choice, the environmental conditions of self-determination such as "the power, right or liberty to choose ." (p. 246). In stark contrast to these definitions of self-determination, Serna and Lau-Smith (1995), crafted the following description noted for its lack of introversion and fatalistic decision-making processes: Self-determination refers to an individual's awareness of personal strengths and weaknesses, the ability to set goals and make choices, to be assertive at appropriate times, and to interact with others in a socially competent manner. A self-determined person is able to make independent decisions based on his or her ability to use resources, which includes collaborating and networking with others. The outcome of a self-determined person is the ability to realize his or her own potential, to become a productive member of a community, and to obtain his or her goals without infringing on the rights, responsibilities, and goals of others. (p. 144). Adapted from the source document.

Gender Violence and Crisis Centres for Women in Russia

Author: Jappinen, Maija11 University of Helsinki

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114370?accountid=14925

Abstract: This ongoing PhD study explores the everyday practices of women's crisis centres in Russia and the constructions of gender violence in these centres. The study is based on rich ethnographic data from four crisis centres in Central and North-Western Russia, and as the theoretic-methodological framework of the study I employ the idea of social problems work (Holstein and Miller 2003) and institutional ethnography by Dorothy E. Smith (2002, 2005). In this paper I briefly introduce the research setting and the current stage of my study. Domestic violence against women has traditionally been a private issue in Russia. Violence within family certainly existed, but the problem was mainly kept inside the homes. Later on, surveys have brought the prevalence of domestic violence against women to people's consciousness. According to a 2002 survey, up to fifty per cent of married women have experienced physical violence from the side of their husbands at least once, and eighteen per cent of women live in conditions of severe or continuous violence (Gorshkova and Shurygina 2003). Gendered violence within family was constructed as a social problem requiring state's and society's intervention in Russia only in 1990s. Independent women's groups raised the issue to public discussion (Hemment 2004), and first crisis centres were soon established to help victims of violence and to change attitudes towards the problem in society (Johnson 2009, Zabelina 1999). Today, there are both non-governmental crisis centres and crisis departments of public social service centres working with victims of violence. The number of public units has been rising, but simultaneously many of the NGOs are struggling for their existence because of lack of funding (Johnson 2009, Johnson and Saarinen 2011, Liapunova and Dracheva 2009). Adapted from the source document.

Reflexivity and Alienation in Transition: The Moral Regulation of Life Conduct in 'Competence agencies'

Author: Duker, Jan11 Bielefeld University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/835114213?accountid=14925

Abstract: The research focus will mainly be on processes of reflexivity of young people who are in the transition from school to work. Unlike the definition of 'reflexivity' which refers to a higher form of consciousness that critical sociologists apply, this research utilises the definition of the politics of the self, which arguably every person employs, that is the relation of the self to itself. The central assumption underlying this research is that these processes mediate between individual concerns and structural contexts. Thus, reflexivity is conceptualised as the most important part of subjectivity, and is itself mediated through institutions such as Social Work, which sometimes directly aim at the specific self-relations of clients. This, I will argue, amounts to something that can be defined as "moral regulation". In this paper I will outline the methodological part of the research, connecting 'Competence agencies' to concepts of reflexivity, moral regulation and alienation. However, I will not elaborate on the empirical part of the research. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Aluru, Sambasiva Rao11 NABARD, Andhra Pradesh Regional Office, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992479?accountid=14925

Abstract: The SHG-Bank Linkage Programme has been heralded as one of the largest microfinance programmes in the world. This article presents the evolution of the concept, the efforts of NABARD in grounding the programme, and also the impact of the programme as revealed in studies conducted by NABARD. The last section of this article discusses the major challenges faced by the programme. The article ends with a note that the SHG movement involves poor people across the country and interference with the design of the SHG movement has the potential to vitiate the credit culture and affect the relationship of SHGs with the banking structure. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: It is often believed that poor people do not or cannot save money and despite their needs being very small, have to depend on moneylenders. However, it has been observed that the poor can save, maybe small amounts and a concerted effort must be made to help them do so in a systematic way. Their meagre savings can be kept in a safe place and used in the time of need. Towards this end, the Andhra Pradesh Grameen Vikas Bank (APGVB) has provided broad interventionist schemes like Palamitra, Suvidha Vikas, and so on, to help make a difference in the lives of women SHG members in rural areas. The present article tries to explain the role of the APGVB in linking with SHGs and the impact created by its initiatives. Adapted from the source document.

SHG-Bank Linkage: Impact on Livelihoods of the Poor

Author: Srinivas, S11 The Livelihood School, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992490?accountid=14925

Abstract: SHGs of women, as a model of extending financial services, provided a great hope towards creating a large number of sustainable livelihoods to the poor. The bank linkage, besides intensive facilitation by the state and civil society organisations, has been a catalytic factor for the SHGs to gain strength. This article attempts to consolidate the learning from this experience and identify the niche for the social work profession to engage with SHGs. Adapted from the source document.

SHGs and Microcredit in the Tribal Context: Experience of Laya Resource Centre

Author: Dsouza, Nafisa Goga11 Laya Resource Centre, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992803?accountid=14925

Abstract: Laya, a resource centre for tribals, has been working in the tribal belt of North Andhra region since 1985. This article explores Laya's experiences with SHG processes, the role and relevance of microcredit, and the various approaches that are possible within the space open to civil society initiatives. One such approach with a highly intensive involvement has been the promotion of the people's bank, Manyaseema, in 1989 that emerged following Laya's response to exploitation by moneylenders in the region who were charging exorbitant interest rates. The second approach of Laya is aimed at capacity building of tribal-led community-based organisations to facilitate SHGs and in the process utilise this platform for promoting engagement on community issues. The third approach is the promotion of linkages of SHGs with the Velugu programme of the government and provide some additional proactive steps in ensuring positive impact. The article concludes by reflecting on the challenges faced particularly if they are expected to lead to a meaningful empowerment process within them and in relation to larger societal issues. Adapted from the source document.

Leveraging Livelihoods for Muslim Women in Hyderabad: Role of SHGs

Author: Srinivas, S1; Asgar, Ali; Padmaja, K1 The Livelihood School, Hyderabad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992496?accountid=14925

Abstract: Today, an increasing number of women in most parts of India - especially in the rural south - are coming together to form SHGs, largely engaged in providing savings and credit services to their members. A few also pursue a social agenda such as supporting the anti-liquor movement, improving health and education of their communities, and so on. Credit services are complemented with other services to create or support livelihoods of members and their families. These efforts are supported by NGOs and state agencies. While the benefits are diverse, ranging from creating opportunities for saving to enterprise promotion, one of the most articulated benefit for the SHG members is the freedom to come out from their homes and speak up in public'. This article, prepared on the basis of interactions with SHG women members, attempts to capture the experiences of Muslim women in Hyderabad. Adapted from the source document.

What are SHG Members Doing with Large Loans?

Author: Reddy, K Raja1; Reddy, C S1 Andhra Pradesh Mahila Abhivruddhi Society, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992501?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the past few years, SHGs have been receiving large loans from banks under the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme. According to NABARD (2007), SHGs that were linked to banks for credit during 2006-2007, have received an average loan of Rupees 58,079 per SHG. The SHGs established earlier received a loan of Rupees 1,00,000 to 3,00,000. The present article focuses on how the SHGs have utilised these large loans, repaid them and the changes which have occurred at the household and SHG levels. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Reji, E M11 Centurion School Rural Enterprise Management, Paralakhemundi, Orissa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613477?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study attempts to provide a framework for assessing empowerment in the context of microfinance programmes and is based on literature review related to microfinance and women's empowerment. In the first stage, it provides a conceptual understanding of empowerment and then explains the role of microfinance in empowerment of the poor. In the second stage, it identifies the contextual variables/indicators of empowerment in the context of microfinance programmes and then integrates these into a framework for the assessment of women's empowerment. In the process, the study draws heavily on the experiences documented in the case studies on microfinance and literature on women's empowerment. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: In recent years, it has been observed that youth are relinquishing their duty of looking after their elderly parents. Understanding the attitudes of youth towards their elderly parents would bring to light their perception of responsibility towards the elderly. The purpose of this study is to understand the responsibility of Malaysian youth towards supporting their elderly parents and to determine the social variables which influence their sense of responsibility.

Revisting the Father-Son Conflicts in Chinese Families from a Cultural Lens: Implications for Family-Centered Practice In Chinese Societies

Author: Chan, Simon T M11 Dept Social Work, Hong Kong Baptist U simon@hkbu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61340897?accountid=14925

Abstract: A Chinese proverb reads "Wu Chou Bu Cheng Fu Zi" -- (hatred bonds the father and his son). This well describes many of the father-son struggles found in clinical cases in Chinese families where the son rejects the father, who tries his best to get along with the son. The explanation for this phenomenon can be found in the field of family therapy (Bowen, 1976, 1985; Minuchin, 1996, 1993), which states that the son is being triangulated in the marital conflict and allied with the mother. However, there is no comprehensive account of the issue of father-son conflict and its inconsistency with classical Chinese concepts such as filial piety. This gap in the research can be addressed with interviews of Chinese families in a clinical context, in which the concept of family justice can be deduced. This article not only unearths the concept of family justice in Chinese families, which hitherto has been rather hidden (Hall,1990), but also prepares that way to continue the research practice of conducting family interview on Chinese families. Through such conceptual discussions, classical concepts in Chinese culture can be recalled, and strategies for indigenous Chinese family therapy can be cultivated. Adapted from the source document.

Violence Against Aged Widows In India: A Socio-Psychological Analysis

Author: Mallick, Anupriyo11 Eastern Institute for Integrated Learning in Management, Kolkata, West Bengal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61373725?accountid=14925

Abstract: Women suffer from various handicaps and injustices in Indian society, widowhood being one of them. It is considered as the greatest and saddest change in the life of a woman. Widowhood is both a personal condition and a social status. The transition from wife to widow in Indian culture and tradition is distressing and the life of a widow is made miserable by the norms of patriarchy. She has to find a new support system, new sources of attachment and new social networks, which are often difficult. She faces emotional trauma, familial exploitation and social stigma. Thus, widowhood is both a crisis and a problem. The present article attempts to explain the phenomenon of violence against aged widows through different theoretical perspectives with a focus on the practices meted out to widows in India. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61383308?accountid=14925

Abstract: Researchers have explored the dichotomy relating to the identity of devadasis as temple dancers and the predominant view of their identity as a 'sacred prostitute'. On the basis of an in-depth qualitative research study undertaken in Koppal (Karnataka), different aspects of the livelihood of devadasis have been analysed in this article along with an assessment of the impact of legislative and welfare schemes. The researchers have made recommendations for the effective implementation of schemes. Adapted from the source document.

Participation of Women in Water Management: An Appraisal of Water User's Associations of the Cumbum Valley Irrigation System

Author: Dasthagir, K Gulam11 Department of Sociology, The New College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377632?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Tamil Nadu Farmers' Management of Irrigation Systems Act has legalised the participation of registered land owners in the management of large-scale bureaucratic irrigation systems through water user associations (WUAs) since 2001. This article examines the membership, participation and representation of women farmers in WUAs in a medium Irrigation system in the state. Findings reveal that the patriarchal social structure and institutions effect gender discrimination in land ownership as women farmers face a glass ceiling in their participation and representation in WUAs - nominal membership, notional participation and non-representation are the hurdles that women farmers face. Adapted from the source document.

Rights of Migrant Labour at the Alang Ship Breaking Yard

Author: Misra, Hrudanand11 K.P. Patel School of Management and Computer Studies, Kapadwanj, Gujarat

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384718?accountid=14925

Abstract: Labour rights are a debatable issue worldwide. With the increase in industrialisation and urbanisation, it has been observed that people move from rural areas to urban-based industries. This migration of labour calls for various labour rights and becomes paramount, especially when appropriate working and living conditions are curtailed. This article reviews the labour rights of those working in hazardous industries like ship breaking and explores the underlying factors that contribute to the violation of labour rights. The article also focuses on the relevance of labour rights in the Alang Ship Breaking Yard. Adapted from the source document.

Behaviour-Based Safety Management: Case Studies across Industries in India

Author: Kaila, H L11 Department of Psychology, SNDT Women's University, Mumbai, Maharashtra

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382257?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is a part of an on-going national action research of behaviour-based safety (BBS) in India including 1,750 executives and 713 workers in 57 organisations based on 'in-depth group interviews' and a structured questionnaire using open-ended questions. This article includes a number of original case studies and field observations selected during BBS training interventions in a period of 12 years between 1997 and 2009 across Indian industries (such as petroleum, steel, cement, power, chemical, among others), which could be highly useful in the application of the concept and process of BBS for human resource/safety professionals. It will also be useful for those concerned about correcting unsafe behaviours for reduction of accidents and promoting safe behaviours for developing an injury-free culture in their organisations. Adapted from the source document.

Job Satisfaction of Youth Outreach Workers in Hong Kong

Author: Lee, Francis Wing-Lin1; Wong, Chris Sum-Yee1 U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/753992898?accountid=14925

Abstract: The promotion of job satisfaction that may lead to staff retention has always been a popular concern for human resources research. The job satisfaction and staff retention of workers in District Youth Outreaching Social Work Teams (YOTs) in Hong Kong are the themes of the present study. Through a literature review, eight facets of job satisfaction, namely Coworker Relationships, Job Complexity and Nature, Promotional Opportunity, Pay and Benefits, Work Environment, Supervision and Leadership, Role and Responsibility, and Recognition, are identified and measured among the frontline staff of the YOTs through pre-set self-administered mailed questionnaires. In relation to these facets, their intention to leave the service is also explored. The findings reveal that these workers are generally satisfied with their job (the service). At the end, some recommendations are made to promote job satisfaction and facilitate staff retention in YOTs in Hong Kong. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: In order to disseminate mental health information to the Cantonese-speaking Chinese immigrants in the greater Houston area in the United States, the author initiated a local radio program to deliver 25 mental health topics to educate and stimulate the interests of the listeners. Once a week for 25 weeks, six shows were pre-recorded, and 19 shows were broadcasted live to receive phone-in calls from listeners. Among these weekly radio shows, 31 calls were received and answered. All female callers (n = 22) addressed parenting and emotional issues, while most male callers (n = 8; 89%) described being maltreated by their wife. The purpose of this qualitative practice update is to use content analysis data to inform practitioners about the unaddressed mental health needs of Chinese immigrants and make service planning suggestions based on "unheard voices".

Approaching Migrant Youth Marginalization through the Capabilities Approach: Methodological Proposals

Author: Baros, Wassilios1; Manafi, Georgia1 Dept Primary Level Education, Democritus U Thrace, U Ioannina

Abstract: Adopting the capabilities approach and the terminology that has been respectively developed, we could assume that Amartya Sen's "capabilities" consist in the actual living that people manage to achieve ("functionings") as a result of actual free will. Sen's freedom does not "only [depend on the] mere degree of the presence or absence of coercion or interference (from others)" (Otto and Ziegler 2006) but also on "the range of options a person has in deciding what kind of life to lead" (Dreze and Sen 1995, 10). In his book, Identity and Violence, Sen, without explicitly connecting the capabilities approach with his views on "genuine multiculturalis" [1] (Sen 2007), in fact, introduces this extended conception of freedom in the way we examine identity matters. Since freedom becomes perceptible as the range of options a person has, concerning the kind of life he wishes to live, cultural freedom can be defined through the concept of the multiplicity of belonging. In other words, cultural freedom constitutes itself a capability, which is realized when nothing and no one, not even myself, can tie me down to a kind of cultural rigidity that tends to exclude and marginalize me. This latent connection of "capabilities" with "multiple identities" (Sen 2007) challenges us to search for the contribution Sen's approach could have in the understanding and confrontation of issues concerning migrants, away from theoretical patterns that overemphasize the cultural otherness as an impediment to inclusion. Besides, Sen himself, without of course focusing exclusively on migrants, has already approached the matter of social exclusion with terms of his capabilities approach (Sen 2000). Adapted from the source document.

Innovative Interventions with Alcohol Problems in Rural Areas: An Indian Experience and its Relevance to Rural America

Author: Chakradhar, Kala11 Murray State U, KY kala.chakradhar@murraystate.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365789?accountid=14925

Abstract: Conventional interventions used to address the complex problems of substance abuse call for multifaceted approaches reflecting the diverse backgrounds of affected populations. In this paper the rural context is highlighted as an asset in contributing to sustainable recovery from alcohol problems. Against the background of comparing two international rural contexts and recognizing shared identities, a case is made for transfer of knowledge east to west. The success elements of a unique approach to intervention with problems associated with excessive drinking in rural areas of South India, based on the experiences of Community-Based Rehabilitation camps is described. Spanning two decades of systematic implementation, the camps utilize existing community resources for planning, execution, and follow-up of treatment while simultaneously creating greater awareness about alcohol abuse through community education. After a critical examination of prevailing treatment options for problem drinking in rural America, inter-country analysis reveals contextual similarities between rural America and rural South India based on community-orientation, cost-containment, and social capital formation with implications for rural social work intervention with alcohol problems in the United States.

Orphanhood, Poverty and the Care Dilemma: Review of Global Policy Trends

Author: Abebe, Tatek11 Centre Child Research, Norwegian U Sciences & Technology, Trondheim, Norway tatek.abebe@svt.ntnu.no

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390691?accountid=14925

Abstract: The care and protection of children experiencing orphanhood presents a major child-care policy challenge. This paper draws on a review of the literature to document divergent conceptualizations of orphanhood, how the hurdles for the care of orphans reflect wider issues of poverty and inequality, as well as the ways in which different care interventions (familial, institutional, community-based and rights-based) might be appropriated for children in need. It is argued that the map of contemporary orphanhood overlaps with the contours of global poverty, inequality, age-based deprivations and marginalization. An example of a 'globalised' model of orphan care, namely SOS Children's Villages, is presented and its implications for policy are examined. The paper highlights the significance of fighting poverty and enhancing the care-giving capabilities of extended families in the care and protection of children from a rights-based perspective. It suggests that external interventions should primarily address the structural causes of poverty and marginality, rather than amplifying inequalities through the selective support of orphans in economically vulnerable communities.

Author: Misra, Hrudanand11 K.P. Patel School of Management & Computer Studies, Kapadwanj, Gujarat

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377393?accountid=14925

Abstract: The concept of migration has gained importance in social science, particularly in population studies. The Alang Ship Breaking Yard (ASBY), in the western state of Gujarat, is considered to be the world's largest ship breaking yard and employs 30,000 labourers directly and 1.5-1.6 lakh labourers indirectly in both its downstream and upstream industries. In ASBY, a majority of the labourers have migrated from different states of the country -- Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, as well from different regions of Gujarat. There are various factors associated with the migration of labour from their place of origin to ASBY. The aim of this article is to focus on the process of migration of labour as well as the differentials and determinants of migration. This article also identifies the factors influencing out-migration from rural areas. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Thakur, Jaikishan11 Selection Grade Lecturer of Sociology, Government Degree College, Slndhnur, Karnataka, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395008?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the article Is to examine whether socioeconomic and demographic factors continue to influence the rate of divorce in modern India in view of modernisation, urbanisation, Industrialisation, prevalence of congenial conditions for women's education, employment as well as enactment of liberal laws in favour of women's empowerment.

Health Hazards Faced by Floating Commercial Sex Workers: A Study in Rajshahi City, Bangladesh

Author: Abedin, Sumaiya1; Rahman Khan, Mohammad Atikur; Uddin, Taz; Rahman, J.A.M. Shopquilur1 Department of Population Sciences, University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61395973?accountid=14925

Abstract: The clandestine nature of floating commercial sex workers (CSWs) in Bangladesh has made healthcare difficult, especially since a large number of CSWs work outside brothels -- non-brothel commercial sex is considered illegal in Bangladesh. The aim of this study is to investigate the stark reality of commercial sex work of floating sex workers, their socioeconomic levels and the hazardous health condition they face. Information on socioeconomic, demographic and health-related data was collected from 176 floating CSWs of Rajshahi city in Bangladesh. The study revealed that most CSWs resorted to commercial sex for their daily survival and that they suffered from various physical problems-vaginal pain (64.8%), blood discharge (4.5%), vaginal pus discharge (61.4%) itching and stitch problem (43.7%). To identify a set of influential factors that cause such problems, we fit logistic regression and linear probability models by forward selection method. The number of years in commercial sex, number of children born before resorting to commercial sex work, body fat and pulse pressure were found to be significant factors responsible for most health problems. Adapted from the source document.

Critical Macroeconomics Analysis under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) Arrangement for Bangladesh

Author: Rahman, Khan Md Azizur1; Husna, Asma Ull1 Khulna University, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389793?accountid=14925

Abstract: External factors have always played an important role in Bangladesh's economy, though the relative importance of various external factors (such as export, import, remittances and foreign aid) has changed over time. This paper examines the macroeconomic outlook and outcome focusing on the different macro states existing in the economy of Bangladesh. As Bangladesh is a developing country with abject poverty and vulnerable to the macroeconomic volatilities, the growth process becomes influenced over a period of time. Following a strong growth of 5.4% in 2006, the global output growth is to be 4.9% in 2007 (WEO, April 2007, IMF); while the developing world grows by 7.0%. Economic growth of Bangladesh has got its momentum from neighbouring countries. While, Bangladesh experienced a real GDP growth of 6.63% in FY (Fiscal Year) 06, the growth projection for the current fiscal year is 6.5%. The policy strategy initiated and the reform programme undertaken by the government was to help the economy to grow by 7.0% in FY 08, but also pave the way for Bangladesh to become a member of the middle income group country by the end of the next decade. Economic growth is expected to be lower than previously forecast. In the face of this greater uncertainty, the Government will pursue a pro-active macroeconomic and fiscal management strategy so that it can ensure a timely response to the emerging challenges and risks. This paper has also put forward the implications of the findings for policies related to the external sector of Bangladesh. The paper suggests that Bangladesh needs a steady growth based on foreign investment, service income and trade. The report adds that future growth of Bangladesh will depend on promoting export, sustaining remittances and triggering export. What needs to be done is two-pronged -- accelerate growth and make it more pro-poor. A more pro-poor pattern of growth has the potential to be more equitable which would be an added long term benefit to the country's development. Adapted from the source document.

Garbage-Combers of Delhi: Aspects of Deprivation

Author: Choudhary, Bikramaditya Kumar11 Department of Geography (MMV), Banaras Hindu University

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61381307?accountid=14925

Abstract: 'Waste' is both a richly polysemic term and a complex, socially constructed category. Apart from its reference to waste substances (which are socially defined as such), it carries several negative, non-material connotations in the socio-cultural context. The term 'waste,' employed in a non-material sense, is often used to represent and treat social entities or groups as redundant. Garbage-comber is one such group that comes from the poorest section of society and earn their livelihood from waste. While they share a portion of the burden of municipal bodies, which are to collect the entire generated-waste in the large third world cities, they subject their individual health to hazardous conditions. The garbage-combers of Delhi, the capital of India, exemplify such phenomenon. Adapted from the source document.

Empowerment of Women in India through Panchayati Raj System

Author: Pradhan, Sanjay Kumar1; Dutta, Geetanjali1 Mody Institute of Technology and Science, Sikar, Rajasthan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61359029?accountid=14925

Abstract: In India, a silent revolution has taken place in rural areas where people are becoming conscious of their rights. One-and-a-half decades after the introduction of the panchayati raj system at the grassroots level, it is now appropriate to take stock of the situation of women participation and empowerment in India. Generally, there have been contrasting responses to this phenomenon. One, an overwhelming reaction to the entry of women in panchayats, which many term as superficial, as most women are token heads, harassed in public sphere and hijacked by their male relatives; and the other, a positive response to their involvement and participation. Adapted from the source document.

From Unity to Diversity: Transformation in the Perception of the Orient in German Philosophy in the Period 18th-early 19th Centuries and its Consequences

Author: Mistry, Jal1; Savalinova, Irina1 Vedanta Academy, Malavali near Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365231?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study analyses how and why the shift in the perception of the Orient from the vision of unity and equality to the perception of diversity and sharp contrasts took place in the works of German philosophers in the period 1750-1850. The change of perception was an entirely subjective phenomenon caused by social, political and ideological transformations within Europe and had little to do with the Orient per se. The 'transformation to modernity,' which European nations experienced during this period released the process of self-reflection and self-assertion among Europeans. As a result of social and political changes, a new, modern, progressive and dynamic society was emerging. It was confronted with the necessity to re-invent its own cultural self-image. This re-invention took place against the background of the Orient, 'The Other of Europe.' 'The Other' served as a catalyst in the process of self-understanding and self-assertion. Westerners conceptualised the Orient as inferior, lethargic and stagnant. At the same time they projected a self-image of modern and progressive Europe which has a right to dominate 'The Other.' This self-image was later utilised by the mechanisms of power to serve as an instrument in imperial politics. The feeling of superiority and justification of a cultural and political domination of Europeans in the Orient were initially thoughts and ideas of a few European thinkers. However, such is the power of human thought that if nourished and supported it metamorphoses into a concept, a powerful ideology which becomes a driving force in the historical process. Adapted from the source document.

Assessment and Patient Satisfaction following the Use of Intrauterine Contraceptive Devices

Author: Umranikar, Aarti1; Umranikar, Sameer1 St. Mary's Hospital, Portsmouth, U.K

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61381776?accountid=14925

Abstract: Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the increase in use of the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD/IUS) used by women from Southampton, U.K.; to assess views of patients regarding the contraceptive services offered; and assess patient satisfaction. Study Design: The target group for this study were the patients attending the Contraceptive Sexual Health (CASH) clinic and the Primary Care Setting in Southampton. Information was obtained about the types of contraceptives used by the 1,524 women who formed part of the study group from where data was collected. A questionnaire was then sent to 50 women of this group, regarding their experience while receiving the intrauterine contraceptive device and the satisfaction derived. Each item was graded on a scale of 5 to 1, that is, 'extremely happy' to 'very dissatisfied' using the Likert Scale of patient satisfaction. Results: Out of the 1,524 patients, 7.02% women preferred to use IUD/IUS while 30.19% used a combined pill, 9.84% used injection Depo-Provera, 6.30% used implants and 46.72% used other methods like condoms. 94.4% of the women were very satisfied with the overall services offered (grades 5 and 4 on Likert scale). It was observed that there is a direct correlation between women's assessment of services and their experience of coil insertion. If the experience of the woman at coil insertion was very good, it correlated well with the level of satisfaction that she expressed about services offered and this was statistically significant. Conclusion: Increase in usage of IUD/IUS was recorded at 7.02% for those women from Southampton U.K. who availed NHS facility, compared to the national average of 4%; and these patients were very satisfied with the services provided. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The present research is an exploratory research focused on emotional expressivity of university students in China. The methodology of the research combined quantitative & qualitative, including Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire (BEQ, Gross & John, 1995) drawn from U.S.A., & in-depth interview. 1531 participants from 13 universities in Beijing with 829 females & 702 males were invited to participate in the research, & 15 students with 7 females & 8 males (about 1% of Ss) received the in-depth interview. In this research, data shows that Chinese university students are highly in emotional expressivity generally, especially in positive emotional expressivity (M=5.25, SD=.80), while relatively low in negative emotional expressivity (M=4.02, SD=.99). Significant differences are found in Chinese students' emotional expressivity in gender, & major (p<.05). Females are higher than males, & students who study Arts display higher emotional expressivity than students who study Science. From in-depth interview data analysis, strong Chinese culture characteristics can be found in students' emotion expressivity, including relation-focus, the doctrine of the medium, & family-value-focus, etc. Gender difference in emotional expressivity can be tracked to Chinese traditional concept of gender expectation as "Male dominate outside while female dominate inside" (??????). Since most of the Arts students are female, they higher in emotional expressivity may also be tracked to gender expectation of emotional discourse. The present research is to present some principle of emotional expressivity of university students in China, & the finding of the research can be the empirical basis for university students' emotional education, psychological counseling & the further research, not only in practice but also in future researches. Adapted from the source document.

Hawkers and Vendors in Mumbai, India

Author: Sharma, R N1; Sita, K1 School of Social Sciences, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61455557?accountid=14925

Abstract: The informal sector constitutes a vital element of the Third World urban economies. A visible component of this sector consists of hawkers and vendors. The present paper is based on data collected through a census survey of all hawkers on municipal lands in the city of Mumbai. The paper highlights the characteristics of the activity and brings into sharp focus the issues involved. This sector presents a situation where the 'public space' becomes an arena for conflict between people using the footpaths, hawkers desperately seeking to earn their livelihood, and their day-to-day harassment by the 'regulating' authorities. Adapted from the source document.

Labour Migration and HIV/AIDS Vulnerability: An Overview of International Research

Author: Palo, Sasmita11 School of Management and Labour Studies, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61420490?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on the linkage between migration and HIV/AIDS provides mixed results. On the one hand, there is ample empirical evidence which upholds a higher level of positive correlation between labour migration and HIV vulnerability. On the other hand, there is evidence which effaces the above inference and maintains that staying in the country of origin does not essentially reduce the risk of HIV infection. The objective of the present paper is to probe further the complex relationship between the two, and disinter various conditions of migration that contribute to increasing HIV vulnerability. The discussion is primarily based on the available body of international research pertaining to the field. The discussion reveals that there is nothing about being a migrant per se which runs the higher risk of contracting HIV virus. Rather, the underlying factors are various social and behavioural patterns of some mobile groups, which place them at a higher risk of HIV infection. Adapted from the source document.

An Empirical Study of Why Girls Work in India

Author: Sundari, S11 Mother Teresa Women's University, Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61426662?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this paper an attempt has been made to study the question of girl child labour prevalent in select villages in Tamil Nadu, India. The study addresses the issues of why the households supply girl child labour for wages in the labour market; how the girls are exploited, how they are caught in a debt trap and also compares the girl child labour with that of boys. The empirical results suggest that it is the children of the socially and economically deprived sections of the population who work and highlight the intergenerational transmission of poverty and girl child labour. Adapted from the source document.

Youth in Organised Crime in Mumbai Metropolis: A Developmental Perspective

Author: Sarkar, Sumita11 Yadavrao Tasgaokar School of Business Management (affiliated to University of Mumbai), Karjat

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61426731?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on the author's doctoral thesis, this paper presents significant case studies and discusses several factors conducive to the entry of youth in hardcore crime. An important factor for the evolution of crime culture and its influence on the youth of Mumbai appears to be the creation of wealth, more so through unethical means and within broad capitalist formations -- under the paradigm of 'development.'.

Anti-Feminist Backlash and Violence against Women Worldwide

Author: van Wormer, Katherine11 U Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61361650?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although globalization, through the communications revolution and international law, brings the promise of progressive social change, the concern of this paper is with the backlash against women's increasing emancipation, a backlash that is evidenced in the United States through making a mockery of women's bid for equality by turning the principles against some women whose lives are troubled while rewarding others. Meanwhile across the world the victimization of women, personal and cultural, is taking place in both democratic and totalitarian regimes. Two related forms of backlash are institutional and personal. That forces from the global market and the corporate media help fuel this backlash is a major contention of this paper. In our examination of the world's war against women, let us look first at how it is played out in a nation that has long touted women's equality. The guiding theoretical framework for the present paper is Susan Faludi's concept of backlash. My aim is to develop this concept further by discussing two forms of backlash against women in the world today -- (1) institutional or politically based backlash and (2) the war against women that operates at the more personal level. Let us look first at Faludi's (1991) theoretical contribution. The publication of Faludi's insightful Backlash: The Undeclared War against American Women was a defining moment for many women in the United States and even a turning point for some. Because so much attention had been focused in the media and elsewhere on women's progress, few made note of the unintended consequences. Fewer still even noticed a counter movement, the decidedly anti-intellectual thrust that was also strongly anti-feminist. It was a case where what was pointed out was suddenly obvious; only then did this awareness strike home. Backlash, as Faludi indicates, is borne out of success; one party makes claims, advances and another party feels left out, resentful threatened. Faludi argues that the anti-feminist backlash has been set off not by women's achievement of full equality but by the increased possibility that they might win it. It is a pre-emptive strike that stops women long before their goals are achieved. She describes the "countercurrents and treacherous undertows" of the backlash -- which are highly effective in that even those who see themselves as feminists can be dragged down by them. 'This counterassault,' writes Faludi (1991, p. xviii), 'stands the truth boldly on its head and proclaims that the very steps that have elevated women's position have actually led to their downfall.' Liberation, as Faludi further suggests, has now became the true American scourge. Just when women's quest for equal rights had started to gain ground with extensive affirmative action programs in place; just when women had joined the ranks of virtually all the male dominated and prestigious and even macho professions; just when laws protecting rape victims and battered women from being belittled and attacked in court, almost predictably an antifeminist resistance set in. For everyone or two steps forward, there has been one step back. Adapted from the source document.

Research in Youth Culture and Policy: Current Conditions and Future Directions

Author: Dolby, Nadine11 Purdue U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61332763?accountid=14925

Abstract: The author first want to briefly map the current conditions faced by youth across developed societies today many of which have been previously discussed at this conference and then to move to suggesting priorities for a research agenda. First, and perhaps most significantly, youth today face a wholly different set of economic conditions than those which existed a generation ago. Paul Willis's brilliant ethnography, Learning to Labour (1977) captures the last moments of large-scale industrial capitalism in England. In the book, he analyzes how working class and marginalized youth reproduced their class positions within an industrialized society. Stressing the agency and the creativity in these youth's practices, Willis documents how these working class boys create a culture of resistance and opposition to authority. But, of course, as is well known, the lads' resistance is pyrrhic, for their opposition to schooling and advancement through the credentialing systems of capitalism leads only to the shop floor, which, as they grow older, ultimately becomes a prison they cannot escape. Yet, in retrospect, the reproductive marginalization of Willis's lads seems almost idyllic. For Willis's lads, with only a secondary education, are able to secure jobs for life. Today, youth in modern societies with equivalent credentials cannot look forward to such an economically secure if limited and drabfuture. Finally, the author want to draw attention to the economic situation of those youth who are rarely seen or analyzed as marginalized: middle class youth whose prestigious university educations and advanced degrees allow them access to economic gains unavailable to poorer youth. Yet, among these youth, at least in the United States, there is a desperate fear of economic instability. Thus far in this paper, the author has discussed the economic conditions which shape youth's present and the possibilities for youth's future. The author will now turn to a discussion of another important realm-culture which is also constitutive component of the new mapping of the world at the beginning of the 21st century. Lastly, the author wants to focus on five directions for research on youth, youth culture, and youth policy in the next decade. The five directions are rethinking research on youth identities, a focus on research that bridges the divides, research and practice focusing on the social and cultural agency of youth, extending our research focus, and research that focuses o hope and opportunity. These suggestions may resonate differently in divergent national contexts and the author should add, may not be relevant at all in some contexts. However, they are meant to provide some initial thoughts towards increasing the visibility of this research globally. Adapted from the source document.

Educational and Anthropological Perspectives: An Italian View on Migration in Multi-Cultural Urban Spaces

Author: Panarello, Patrizia11 Dipt Pedagogia & Scienze Educazione, Facolta Scienze Formazione, U Messina, Italy patrizia.panarello@unime.it

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61443945?accountid=14925

Abstract: In contemporary societies there are different ways to perceive the relation between identity & alterity & to describe the difference between "us" & "them," residents & foreigners. Anthropologist Sandra Wallman sustains that in multi-cultural urban spaces the frontiers of diversity are not only burdensome markers of identity, but rather they could also represent new chances to define "identity" & "alterity." These frontiers, in fact, can work like interfaces through which to build time after time, in a creative way, a relationship with the other. From this point of view, the concept of boundary can offer many opportunities to creatively define the relation with the other & to sign new options for cognitive & physical movement. On the other side, in many cases we have a plenty of mechanisms of exclusion that transforms a purely empirical distinction between "us" & "them" in an ontological contrast, as in the case when the immigrant undergoes hostilities through discriminatory language. Even though these forms of racism are undoubtedly objectionable from a theoretical point of view, they are anyway socially "real," in the sense that they are perpetually reaffirmed & strengthened in public opinion. They are in fact implicit "truths," realities that are considered objective, common opinions that are part of day-to-day existence. That is the reason why an anthropological prospective including the study of "common sense" should be adopted in our present day studies on migration, as pointed out by American anthropologist Michael Herzfeld. My primary goal is to analyze with such a critical approach same pre-conditions of racism & exclusion in contemporary multi-cultural urban spaces. On the other hand, this essay would also investigate positive strategies of comparing, interchanging, & negotiating alterity in social work. I suggest that this approach can offer positive solutions in coping with "diversity" & in working out policies for recognizing a common identity which, at the same time, do not throw away the relevance of political & economic power.

Italy: The closure of the House dell'Emigrante as a cue reflection on the fall of Italian emigrants

Author: Pentini, Anna Aluffi1; Olivieri, Fabio1 U Rome, Italy

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61333729?accountid=14925

Abstract: In the literature on migration, as well as in social policies regarding this phenomenon, the situation of returning emigrants receives scant attention. This essay establishes an intricate connection between attitudes and policies that prevail in a country regarding emigration and those concerning immigration. The case of Italy provides a prime example for this as it once was a classical country of emigration, only to turn, in recent decades, into a country that appears highly attractive (and relatively accessible) to immigrants. The essay traces the pervasive ambiguity that characterizes this country's attitudes towards emigration from the beginning of mass emigration shortly after the unification of Italy in 1868 to the emigration policies of the fascist regime of Mussolini and the post-World War II waves of emigration right through to the corresponding ambiguity concerning the status of immigrants in contemporary society, including the indifferent treatment of returning Italian emigrants who constitute a considerable numerical phenomenon.

Lower Benefits to the Refugees in Denmark: Missing Recognition?

Author: Gosh, Flora1; Juul, Soren1 Danish Refugee Council, Copenhagen

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61440292?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is a study of the contrast between the Danish law concerning reduced economic benefits for newly arrived refugees & immigrants (known as Start Help or as introductory benefit) & the idea of recognition as the condition for individual self-realization & justice. Our assumption is that Start Help both implies economic discrimination against newly arrived persons in Denmark (especially refugees & their families under family reunification rules) & symbolizes a lack of recognition. We have chosen to adopt the theories of recognition (and redistribution) propounded by Axel Honneth & Nancy Fraser to explore our queries about Start Help & the discriminatory impact on its recipients. Empirically the article is based on in-depth qualitative interviews with six refugees who all receive Start Help. The article begins by providing an introduction to the debate about integration legislation in Denmark. Subsequently we present & discuss our main theoretical concepts, namely the theories of recognition & justice which function as clues for our empirical analysis. From this theoretical perspective we present finally an empirical analysis of Start Help recipients' experiences. Adapted from the source document.

Polychronic Attitude and Household Activities in Single- and Dual-Career Families

Author: Patra, Anathbandhu1; Suar, Damodar1 Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61378928?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article examines whether the spouses of single-career families differ from dual-career families on polychronic attitude and time spent on household activities. Data was collected from 120 spouses each of single- and dual-career families. The results reveal that the wives in single-career and husbands in dual-career families are more polychronic. While the wives in both the single- and dual-career families do more household activities than their husbands, the husbands in dual-career families do little more work than the husbands in single-career families. The findings support the traditional gender roles. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Nair, Pradeep11 School of Journalism and Mass Communication, Institute of Management Studies, Noida, Uttar Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366520?accountid=14925

Abstract: The shift in development thinking and practice towards people-centred health programmes and the participation of people and communities in decisions concerning their own health problems is creating new opportunities for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) practices in the health sector. Today, ICT is used as an empowerment tool for improving the quality of health practices in both urban and rural areas. This article looks CT as a tool to facilitate development in the health sector by encouraging dialogue and debate. The article outlines ICT as the most prominent and interactive communication method, giving voice to rural and urban people, thus enabling them to articulate their own health agendas. It also examines the fact that by fostering the exchange of knowledge and information, ICT can stimulate people's awareness and motivation, allowing them to take informed decisions on the crucial issues affecting their health. Adapted from the source document.

Intensifying Son Preference and Declining Sex Ratio in India: A Birth Order-based Analysis

Author: Samaiyar, Priyajit11 The Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368991?accountid=14925

Abstract: The disturbing trends of declining sex ratios among children observed in Indian Census 2001 received the concern regarding missing females, particularly girl child, in India. This article carefully reviews the available studies and thereafter attempts a systematic estimation of the magnitude and patterns of sex ratio skewness by using a birth years and birth order-based analysis. Results indicate an increasing intensification of sex preference in Indian states, with 0.1 to 0.2 million missing girl children across the country depending on the assumption used for estimation. Adapted from the source document.

Formation of Voluntary Associations in Iran

Author: Bagheri, Masoumeh1; Noughani, Fatemeh; Moltafet, Housein1 The Department of Economic and Social Sciences, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384650?accountid=14925

Abstract: Non-governmental organisations have attracted growing criticism for being unrepresentative of and unaccountable to the poor people for whose well-being they claim to work. Making a difference to livelihoods and capacities among poor people depends on NGO successes in fostering autonomous grassroots institutions and linking them with markets and political structures at higher levels. The conclusions question the current predilection among donor agencies to fund large-scale NGO service delivery. Adapted from the source document.

Female Agricultural Workers in Cotton Cultivation in Turkey

Author: Gun, Sema1; Gulcubuk, Bulent; Olhan, Emine; Yildirak, Nurettin1 Agricultural Economics Department, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61337019?accountid=14925

Abstract: Female agricultural workers have to undertake the dual responsibility of their role in the family and as agricultural labourers. Besides, they also have to face the burden of dealing with unfavourable conditions at work and life disproportionately, as compared to men. It is essential to implement policies that address the multi-faceted problems they face: working and living conditions, relations with surrounding communities, social security, and health; they are widely dispersed, unorganised, nomadic and living well below the standards of modern living. The most effective step to this end will be to adjust the Labour Code such that it encompasses seasonal agricultural workers as well. Adapted from the source document.

Beggary in Urban India: Reflections on Destitution and Exploitation

Author: Sarkar, Sumita11 Research Cell, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Management Studies and Research, Sector 8, CBD Belapur, Navi Mumbai 400 614

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61363477?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present paper attempts to understand beggary as a growing socio-economic problem and an extreme form of destitution and poverty in urban India. It analyses beggary from a developmental perspective and as an inevitable outcome of exploitation and criminalisation of poor under the vicious force of political economy. The present discourse further explores the possible solutions to deal with beggary under the existing Beggary Laws, the role of NGOs and of Civil Society. Adapted from the source document.

Staying Active and Promoting Well-being Among the Elderly: A Study of Old Age Homes in Orissa

Author: Mishra, Anindya Jayanta11 Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT, Roorkee

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61364029?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this paper, we intend to examine the life-satisfaction of the old age home residents in Orissa within the framework of activity theory of ageing. The theory states that engaging in some kind of activity or work facilitates elderly people to adjust to the later years of their life. This paper is based on the study of old age home residents in Orissa. The finding corroborated the assumption of the activity theory that engaging in various roles not only improves the physical and mental health of the elderly but also instills in them a sense of self-esteem. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic Violence: A Global Perspective

Author: Fawcett, Barbara11 U Sydney

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396016?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic Violence defined as intimate partner violence is differentially understood & responded to within & between countries & it frequently falls short of being seen as a human rights issue which requires government, community & professional responses. This article explores definitions & explanations of domestic violence that have been put forward & considers the associations that have been made between violence & abuse. It also reviews multi-country links between women's health & domestic violence & examines controversial issues surrounding fathers who have been domestically violent. As part of the discussion, professional responsibility & responses are also appraised. It is argued that domestic violence is intrinsically related to gendered power imbalances which have different manifestations in different social & cultural contexts. However the view that violence is inevitable in certain situations is challenged. The ethical imperative of zero tolerance is emphasized, but further research in relation to how gendered power imbalances foster intimate partner violence in some contexts but not in others & how this can be explored in ways which move the discussion away from pathologizing explanations, is highlighted as an area for further investigation. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The most conspicuous change in Hong Kong juvenile justice in recent decades is to divert the offenders from the courts by relaxing the use of the Police Superintendent Discretion Scheme. Nevertheless, the fundamentals of the traditional criminal justice system remain unchanged. Hong Kong has not yet incorporated restorative justice into the criminal justice system. The article discusses restorative justice & explores the feasibility of its adoption in Hong Kong. The authors argue that restorative justice can benefit Hong Kong & professionals can adopt it in our everyday work before formal restorative justice is supported. References.

Donald Tsang's Proposed Family Policy Commission: Lessons from Hong Kong and American Experiences

Author: Mitchell, Robert E

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61432872?accountid=14925

Abstract: Can governments really do anything to strengthen families? What are the implications of different policies for both governments & families? Based on his family-policy responsibilities in Hong Kong & the U.S., the author brings his own personal historical & international lessons of experience for consideration by the proposed Hong Kong commission on family-friendly policies. Competing advocates of family policies might share common historical misunderstandings & value assumptions but they can differ in their definitions of family failure & how government can help families directly through general policies or through problem-specific advocacy groups. In addition to providing the first although abbreviated history of Hong Kong's Urban Family Life Survey of the 1960s, the author proposes three charges to be included in the current commission's terms of reference & work plan. Adapted from the source document.

Author: N., Janardhan1; Johnson, John; Parthasarathy, R1 Community Mental Health, Basic Needs India, Bangalore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384596?accountid=14925

Abstract: Epilepsy is a stigmatising disorder. The available evidence suggests that its diagnosis can have important psychosocial consequences. Hence, it can severely affect the quality of everyday life of people with epilepsy and their families. The present study examines the psychosocial functioning and the quality of life in a group of people whose seizures were well controlled and in a group of people in whom seizures were not controlled. More number of people with epilepsy were worried about their seizure attacks. Among people with refractory epilepsy, psychosocial functioning and adjustment to epilepsy appeared to be low. Majority of people with refractory epilepsy reported high level of distress and more memory problems, problems in attention and concentration, and language problems. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The study was carried out in three irrigation projects in Kerala - Neyyar, Chalakhudy and Malampuzha. More than 650 farmers, 300 officials, members of State Legislative Assembly, leaders of political parties, and so on, were consulted under the study. The study has identified the following pre-requisites for implementation of Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) in Kerala: (i) favourable orientation of politicians and administrators; (ii) changes in the organisational set-up; (iii) legislative backing; (iv) clear water rights; (v) rehabilitation of the irrigation system; (vi) meaningful transfer agreement; (vii) coordination between the stakeholders; (viii) consultation and involvement of farmers; (ix) motivation and incentive system; (x) training and awareness programmes; (xi) involvement of women; and (xii) mechanism to settle disputes. Based on the study, a strategy was designed for the implementation of PIM, and accordingly, two pilot projects are being implemented at the Neyyar and Malampuzha irrigation commands.

Technological Changes and Employees' Perception: A Study of Punjab State

Author: Sharma, Jyoti11 School of Business, PRO Shri Mata Vaishnao Devi University, Vashavi Dham, Railhead Complex, Jammu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366469?accountid=14925

Abstract: Technology is one of the key strategic factors that contribute to business success in the modern business environment. At the same history of industrialisation has also shown that changes in the technology whether in the form of mechanization, automation, and computerisation brings some avenues in the form of performance of tasks with few individuals but also poses some human problems. The textile industry of Punjab is also passing through this state of transition. The ambit of the present paper is to study the perceptions of employees about the technological changes to know about the type of threats which are feared by employees with this process of rationalisation. The study has found that the factors, namely, Personal Discomforts, Productivity and Gains, Change in Work Culture, Control on the Job, and Prior Consultation and Training are identified as the reasons responsible for aversion of technological changes by employees. It points out that physical change in technology and the human change need to be adjusted to the new technology are related, and it would be inappropriate if the focus is only on technology. The study recommends that an organisation is a socio-technical system and, therefore, both the technical system and the social system require equal attention if the objective is to optimise both.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375715?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports child delivery practices pertaining to the place of and the person assisting the delivery among tribal and rural populations of Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh State, India. The article is based on both quantitative data collected from 377 mothers and qualitative data obtained from key informants through in-depth interviews. Irrespective of the higher coverage of ante-natal care, a significant proportion of women delivered their babies at home, often assisted by untrained personnel such as mothers, mothers-in-law or untrained dais (midwives). The study has made some recommendations to make deliveries safer in the hands of trained personnel. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Rahman, Mizamur1; Ali, M Korban1 Department of Population Science and Human Resource Development, University of Rajshahi, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368933?accountid=14925

Abstract: An attempt has made here to find out the effects of socioeconomic characteristics on infant and child mortality. Differential and intensity pattern of infant and child mortality of Rajshahi district, Bangladesh, is examined by Bivariate and Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA). The MCA results show that the father's education has the strongest effect on infant mortality and the mother's education has the second strongest factor. But in child mortality, father's occupation is the strongest factor. The results also indicate that mothers with no education have higher number of infant and child mortality than mothers with secondary and higher education. Thus, it implies that mother's education, father's education and father's occupation has a strong effect on infant and child mortality. Adapted from the source document.

Quality of Life of Migrant Households in Select Slums of Tamil Nadu

Author: Sundari, S11 Mother Teresa Women's University, Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388685?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines the quality of life of the migrant households in select slums of Tamil Nadu State in India on the basis of certain parameters. The study reveals that the physical quality of life of about two-thirds of the migrant households is very poor; they live in unhygienic and congested places devoid of basic necessities for a healthy life like housing, water supply, drainage and sanitation; and women and children are the worst victims as they are physically, mentally and emotionally affected. The rehabilitation measures undertaken by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board is totally inadequate in relation to the mushrooming growth of slums. Hence, a comprehensive package of programmes incorporating the voice of the slum dwellers in the design, execution and implementation should be launched to improve the quality of life of the migrant population besides safeguarding the urban environment. Adapted from the source document.

Utilisation of Primary Healthcare Services: Experiences and Perceptions of a Rural Community in East Godavari District

Author: Babu, B V1; Varma, G R; Nayak, A N; Rath, K1 Division of Epidemiology, Regional Medical Research Centre, Indian Council of Medical Research, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380074?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study intends to assess the utilisation of and satisfaction on government healthcare system by the community in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The study is a community-based, cross-sectional study utilising both quantitative and qualitative methods. Majority of the people said that the visits of peripheral health workers were regular and their services were relevant to the needs of the people. More women are satisfied with these services than men. Almost 60 per cent of people are satisfied with the services available at different healthcare institutions. The qualitative data revealed that some members of the vulnerable communities expressed their dissatisfaction with the healthcare providers by citing incidences of discrimination due to caste and economic condition. Some respondents of the present study were also dissatisfied with the functioning of the health services, and with the attitude of healthcare providers at different health institutions. Functioning of the primary health centre (PHC) system and the attitude of the staff were reasons for dissatisfaction of the people of this area. Though the health outreach of rural Andhra Pradesh is better than the national scenario, to improve further, the attitude of the staff of PHCs should be reoriented. Discrimination between different economic/ethnic groups has a great impact on health outreach in toto. A substantial number of people have no trust on the local health system by virtue of which they prefer the services of private practitioners. Therefore, confidence-building measures should be taken by providing 'quality healthcare services' at the PHC level. Adapted from the source document.

School Dropouts of SC and ST Students in Chennai Corporation Schools

Author: Peter, S1; Raman, K J; Ravilochanan, P1 Loyola College, Chennai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61362830?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study aims at culling out the various factors involved in making students from the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories to drop out of school. The study found that most of them attend school to have the noon meal and avail of monetary benefits like waiver on exam fees, free uniforms and books. As soon as they join secondary school, SC/ST students were forced to discontinue their studies due to various reasons as compared to other caste students. Due to this, SC/ST students find it difficult to start their own business and get employment only in unskilled jobs. The imperative step at this juncture would be 'Education for All' and to stress further 'compulsory education at any cost for all' and also to provide proper education for school dropouts.

Author: Copur, Zeynep1; Erkal, Sibel; Dogan, Nuri; Safark, Sukram1 Department of Family and Consumer Sciences, Hacettepe University, Samanpazari/Ankara, Turkey

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368283?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study was planned and conducted in order to examine the relationship between gender roles and women and men's attitudes towards traditional gender roles, level of sharing domestic roles and responsibilities, and time spent on domestic tasks on weekdays and at weekends. The study involved 600 people (405 men, 195 women) selected through random sampling method from a total of 3,536 staff at Hacettepe University, Beytepe, and the main campuses, who were between ages of 21 and 66 years, and were married with children. The study found that women displayed a more negative attitude towards traditional gender roles than men; that they took on more responsibilities in all tasks, except shopping; the mean time they allowed for domestic tasks was longer both at weekends and on weekdays; and no matter what their gender roles, women performed more domestic tasks than men.

Abstract: Chronicles the post-WWII formation of identities in India from the perspective of postcolonial or subaltern studies. Amartya Sen's (2006) views on the "inclusionary" form of Indian identity that crosses all ethnic groups is reviewed, along with the perspectives of other thinkers (eg, Gandhi) who have attempted to discover the "threads of cosmic unity amongst the pluralist elements" of modern Indian society.

Equality and Diversity in the Dutch Welfare State

Author: van Houten, Douwe

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61402881?accountid=14925

Abstract: Under the Constitution, the equality principle is very important in the Netherlands. This article argues that there is little evidence for equal citizenship in the Netherlands. There is anti-discrimination legislation in the Netherlands, but it is not very robust. The core argument in this article is that the equality principle must be supplemented by the diversity principle. Diversity is multi-dimensional and can refer to religion, philosophy of life, political persuasion, race (ethnicity), gender, nationality, sexual orientation, age, disability and chronic illness. In this paper multi-culturalism and disability are taken into account and we make a comparison of the social position of disabled people and people from ethnic minorities. Policies on diversity are needed to arrive at diverse citizenship in a varied society. This implies that a distinction has to be made between political citizenship and cultural citizenship. The former has to do with equality, and the latter with diversity. Adapted from the source document.

An Australian Perspective on Singaporean Welfare Policy

Author: Mendes, Philip11 Monash U, Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387065?accountid=14925

Abstract: From a Western perspective, Singapore appears to be an overt example of a neo-liberal welfare regime based on low social expenditure, and limited and discretionary social assistance. But the true picture is arguably more complex. Singapore's welfare policy is driven by strong cultural assumptions around individual and family self-reliance, and the inappropriateness of state welfare provision. However, there is also a strong emphasis on communal responsibility for supporting the disadvantaged. Some conclusions are drawn about the limitations of existing policies, and possible new directions for the future. Adapted from the source document.

Victim Support in a Changing Welfare State

Author: Svensson, Kerstin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397806?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses how new kinds of individual needs develop parallel to the changes in the welfare state. From a study of Victim Service in Sweden it is shown how this organisation has grown parallel to the changes in the welfare state. In the empirical material it is also shown that the need of support often comes from secondary victimisation. Those who are helped by Victim Support are often people with loose bonds to society and people of low class. As victims they can get help from Victim Support, but the need derives from lacking service in the welfare state. NGOs have come to complement and strengthen organisations in the public sector when the welfare state has weakened. At the same time as the neo-liberal conception of crime, threats and risk has replaced the social democratic ideas of social security. Adapted from the source document.

Poverty in Israel

Author: Michel, Dirk; Schertges, Claudia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418559?accountid=14925

Abstract: The paper deals with poverty within Israel. Against the background of the history of pre-state Israel and the developments after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 the historical roots of Israeli poverty are analyzed. Thus the 'socialist'-Zionist project, ethnic exclusion, religious and intra-Jewish ethnic lines of conflict as well as the Bedouins, Druzes and Israeli Arabs as 'specific' Israeli citizen are discussed. Despite the economic growth in Israel since 2003 'the majority of Israeli wage earners (over 60percent) earned less than $1,450 a month last year' (Goldstein 2007, p. 1). In 2004 1.3 million Israelis lived below the poverty line, a number which in 2005 increased to more than 1.5 million Israelis. In spite of growing economic prosperity the proportion of families belonging to the working-poor, i.e. families with at least one family member in paid employment, increased from 11.4 percent in 2004 to 12.2 percent in 2005. The percentage of poor families in the working population increased from 40.6 percent to 43.1 percent. Nearly 60 percent of the 'working-poor' were working fulltime (Sinai 2006a, Shaoul 2006). 42 percent of Israeli Arab families are living below the poverty line. The average wages are less than half the wages of Ashkenazi Jews. Every second Israeli Arab child lives in poverty. When in 1996 to 2001 the unemployment rate of the Jewish Israelis increased by about 53 percent, the unemployment rate of the Arab Israelis increased by 126 percent (cf. Shaoul 2006). 80 percent of Israelis regard themselves as poor. 23 percent of the pensioners are living below the poverty line. Poverty among children increased in 1988 to 2005 by about 50 percent. Approximately one fifth of all under-age children (714.000) in Israel are suffering from hunger (cf. Shaoul 2006). 75 percent of the poor families cannot afford medicine and 70 percent are dependant on food donations (cf. Sinai 2005b). Nearly one third of the Holocaust survivors are living in poverty. Some of the Holocaust survivors get $ 600,- per month from the German government, whilst other Holocaust survivors receive only $ 350,- per month from the Israeli Ministry of Finance and the Holocaust survivors that immigrated to Israel after 1953 (who amount to 70 percent of the Holocaust survivors in Israel) only receive the general national pension. Nearly 20 percent of the Holocaust survivors are at the present time 86 years and older, 70 percent are older than 76 years. (cf. Medina 2007, p. 1) They are not entitled to a supplementary payment or to compensation. But the problematic economic situation of the Holocaust survivors is neither new information nor an unknown fact. As a result of the precarious situation several are in need of the help of welfare organizations, because they cannot afford to some degree their necessary medicine.

Human Rights Violations Against Dalits: A Case of Failed State?

Author: Tiwari, Arvind11 Centre for Socio-Legal Studies and Human Rights, School of Social Sciences, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61407982?accountid=14925

Abstract: Continued failure on the part of the State and civil society to check human rights violations against the Dalits, despite existence of stringent laws, raises questions about the role of the Indian State. While it is argued that the State is necessary to protect the human rights of Dalits, and that the Dalits can depend on the State to protect their rights, this article, besides reviewing the constitutional safeguards for Dalits, reviews the performance of the State in ensuring a life with dignity for Dalits. It points out that bias against the Dalits is in-built within the State machinery; and hence, the State alone cannot be expected to protect the Dalits from human rights violations. In which case, the question of whether the Dalits should repose faith in the Indian State for protection of their rights to equal treatment is raised. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article tries to highlight the types of mobilisation present in Indian politics. It specifically explores the nature of caste mobilisation with special reference to Dalits. Nature and impact of the caste mobilisation has also been discussed in the article, which analyses the basic differences between the mobilisation of the Dalits by the so-called upper castes and of the Dalits by Dalits themselves. But the main issue discussed in the article is the new phenomenon of mobilisation of the so-called upper castes by a party led and dominated by the Dalits and other marginalised groups in Uttar Pradesh. It is in this context that an investigation into the nature of this type of the mobilisation and its contribution to Indian society and democracy has been attempted. Adapted from the source document.

Dalit Politics in the Nineties: Electoral Politics and Predicament before an Underprivileged Community

Author: Palshikar, Suhas11 Department of Politics and Public Administration, University of Pune, Pune, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61414430?accountid=14925

Abstract: Dalits experience an underprivileged life and a majority of the Dalits experience a common situation of low economic and social status as well. Therefore, it would be wrong to look at the Dalits merely as belonging to a caste category. Being a Dalit implies a shared life experience of backwardness and, therefore, the lack of political instrument of the Dalits puts them in a situation of further disprivilege. Democracy is expected to provide space to the underprivileged to organise themselves and assert politically. Absence of a political instrument indicates not the success of democracy, but its limitation: the onward march of bourgeois democracy. Adapted from the source document.

How Much Does the City Help Dalits?: Life of Dalits in Pune: Overview of a Century

Author: Deshpande, Rajeshwari11 Department of Politics and Public Administration, University of Pune, Pune, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61425691?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article attempts an overview of the life of Dalits in Pune for over a century's. This overview is based on four extensive socioeconomic surveys of the city's Dalit groups that were undertaken in the last 100 years or so. These surveys have created a rare possibility of longitudinal assessment of the urban Dalit situation. Key common indicators from these surveys were selected to trace some aspects of the journey of Dalit communities in an urban location. The main focus of the article is to see whether, and to what extent, migration to urban centres help in the social and economic betterment of Dalit groups. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Mondal, Nazrul Islam1; Hossain, Kamal; Ali, Korban1 Department of Population Science and Human Resource Development, University of Rajshahi, Rajshahi, Bangladesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61351690?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the progressive movements of women in different sectors of Bangladesh. It has used recent data on demographic and socioeconomic indicators of female status. During the last decade, the results signify that higher increase in school attendance rate for females resulted in closer gap in literacy rate, female participation in the workforce, and readymade garments had major contributions in economic development, and total fertility rate declined dramatically along with improved maternal mortality. Adapted from the source document.

Are Adolescents at Mental Health Risk in Single Parent Families?

Author: Mahajan, Vibha1; Sharma, Deepali1 Department of Home Science, S.D.A.M. College, Dinanagar, Gurdaspur District, Punjab

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61370446?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study examined the mental health status, school adjustment and scholastic achievement of adolescents in single parent families with reference to gender and family structure. The sample comprised 93 adolescents and their single mothers. Data was gathered using Developmental Psychopathology Check List of Children, School Adjustment Inventory, and the Scholastic Achievement record of the adolescents. Results were analysed using multivariate ANOVA and Pearson's correlation. The results revealed that no differences existed in the mental health status and school adjustment of adolescents by gender. However, significant gender differences were evident for scholastic achievement. Regarding family structure, adolescents from nuclear families were significantly better adjusted in school than their counterparts from single parent families. The results also indicated that adolescents who had better mental health status were better adjusted and achieved more in schools. The study suggests planning of intervention strategies and undertaking active research on guidance and counselling involving mothers and adolescents in single parent families. Adapted from the source document.

User Fee in Public Health Institutions: An Experience across Asian and African Countries

Author: Afroz, Saman11 National Service Scheme Unit, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61354654?accountid=14925

Abstract: The introduction of user fee as an alternative source of health financing is widely being questioned across nations mainly because of its inability to generate the required revenue needed for any significant improvements in the quality of care and its implications on equity. This article looks at the experiences of some Asian and African countries for implementation of the fee, which was basically meant to increase the quality, efficiency, sustainability and effectiveness of the government health services and seeks to draw lessons for a country like India. This has been done by the review of relevant national and international studies in the area. Adapted from the source document.

Pension Reforms in the UK, Urban China and Hong Kong: Enhancing Security or Insecurity?

Author: Yu, Wai Kam11 Division Social Studies, City U Hong Kong scsamyu@cityu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398520?accountid=14925

Abstract: The paper studies pension reforms in the UK, urban China & Hong Kong. It argues that these reforms share suggestions raised by the World Bank, & that these reforms are not effective in strengthening the capacity of pension schemes in giving older people a secure retirement life. To increase the effectiveness of these schemes, the three Governments should appreciate that the main purpose of the pension reforms is to provide older people with secure retirement rather than to promote investors' interests. Moreover, they should develop a social consensus on how security should be defined. References. Adapted from the source document.

Is Mumbai Losing its Attraction for Migrants?

Author: Gupta, Kamla1; Yesudian, P Princy1 Department of Migration and Urban Studies, International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61425905?accountid=14925

Abstract: The rapid population growth in Mumbai, India's largest city, has remained a matter of great concern to academicians, policy makers and state politicians and often, these are voiced through the headlines of national and state media. Migration has remained the main force behind the rapid population growth of the city and hence high migration is seen as the root cause of the city's problems. Of late, it has also fuelled the sons of the soil' voices. No doubt the city has achieved an inordinate population size and has grown very rapidly during most of the twentieth century, but its population growth rate has decelerated very rapidly during the last two decades of the twentieth century. This article attempts to study the factors causing this deceleration in population growth in the country's topmost metropolis as well as its future implications not only in the context of Mumbai's development but in the overall urbanisation process of India. The study mainly uses the published data on migration from different censuses to examine the population growth and migration situation. The job situation in Mumbai and macro-level policies of industrial dispersal and their potential role, in affecting the migration situation in Mumbai are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Socioeconomic Status of Elderly Women in India and Japan

Author: Ramachandran, Rathi1; R., Radhika1 Department of Home Science, Government College for Women, University of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61400457?accountid=14925

Abstract: Greying of population is one of the most significant characteristics of the twenty-first century. Rapid ageing trends present new challenges to governments, communities, families, and the elderly themselves. Elderly women are a significant group of the society. Addressing their agendas in familial, social and economic spheres is imperative for improving their overall status and, in turn, the society as well.

Project "Integration of Children with Migration Background in Baden-Wuerttemberg and California"

Author: Sauer, Karin E1; Held, Josef1 Dept Educational Psychology, Eberhard Karls U Tubingen, Germany

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382962?accountid=14925

Abstract: We argue that the study of children's integration-experiences is of great scientific and societal relevance. Thus our research is based on a practical problem which at the same time marks a gap in current research literature. Practical problems are complex; in order to appropriately grasp and represent them, a variety of methods, both quantitative and qualitative, is needed. Within the framework of the project we completed a complex research program in Tuebingen South and Stuttgart East and a field-study in California. We gained insights and experiences and collected data with various methods. In the meantime diverse forms of data, collected by way of questionnaires, sociograms, audio- and videotapes of interviews with teachers and focus-groups are available. Many discussions were held and many observations were documented. References. Adapted from the source document.

Slovenia: Rights and Discrimination

Author: Pecaric, Elena

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388485?accountid=14925

Abstract: A discussion of the rights of & discrimination against disabled persons in Slovenia describes actual cases to point out the misuse of medical files without the patient's permission; the inability of disabled persons to learn the content of their files; & the lack of proper channels to challenge abuse or errors in reports. Other examples of discrimination include the revocation of memberships by the disabled persons society; the submission of false data to the National Electoral Commission by the Social Welfare Chamber that addresses appeals & regulates the execution of ethical principles of social welfare; violations of the right to rehabilitation; & employment discrimination against persons with even minor disabilities, such as having to wear glasses. The lack of action on the part of non-governmental organizations to take measures to protect the human rights of disabled persons is pointed out, along with either outright discrimination or the tendency to ignore injustices against handicapped persons by the very institutions that are charged with protecting them.

New Identity of Russian Speaking Children in Estonian Society

Author: Leino, Mare1; Veisson, Marika; Ruus, Viive-Riina; Sarv, Ene-Silvia; Ots, Loone; Veisson, Anneli1 Tallinn U, Estonia mareleino@hotmail.com

Abstract: According to Estonian Statistical Office whether we take the number of grade repeaters, the number of graduates or the number of students graduating with a distinction as a basis for the analysis, the academic achievement incline has remained the same for several years - girls whose language of instruction is Russian come at the top, followed by girls who study in Estonian. Boys come last, and boys studying in Russian reveal much better results than boys whose language of instruction is Estonian (Heinlo 2001, 23). Current paper is going to show that native Estonians have problems as well and starting from school already; Russian speaking youth is doing even better (with hard work). So the question is: who is the better citizen - a native but quite easy-going, or an (former) immigrant who is eager? In European social thought the concept of citizenship is constructed as universal, but it contains tensions between sameness and difference, us and others, centres and margins (Gordon et al 2000, 9). For us citizenship means belonging, which means safety. Here we will ask: is it (for better future) enough just to be a native Estonian, or should one work for ones success as much as many immigrants do. Tables, References.

Author: Sekher, T V11 International Instit Population Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421342?accountid=14925

Abstract: Demographic & health research in India has undergone significant changes over the decades. It not only illustrates the changing priorities of the researchers, governments & international donor agencies, but also the availability of & accessibility to new sets of information & databases. There is also a greater realization that lack of reliable, representative, & quality data has hindered serious research in the past & there are now efforts to overcome this limitation. International collaboration & considerable funding to collect field-level data have effected a visible & qualitative change in the research scenario, particularly after the 1990s. This article provides an overview of the changing databases & priorities in demographic & health research in India. References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This article attempts to find out the awareness of the various aspects of reproductive health in young women.

AIDS Awareness Campaigns, Sex Education Programmes and Pornography: The Shaping of Sexuality Awareness among College Students

Author: Abraham, Leena11 Unit for Research in Sociology of Education, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397979?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article attempts to explore what constitutes awareness of sexuality and sexual health among urban, unmarried, college-going young men and women from low income families. It shows that sexuality awareness among the youth is limited and the sources that address young peoples' needs are few. The article discusses campaigns to enhance awareness on sexuality and AIDS among youth and explores the reasons for the failure of these campaigns. It is argued that the sex education programmes currently available in colleges are silent on the discourse on sexual pleasure and desire by adopting a medicalised approach to sexuality that has an authorised, 'scientific' voice. Erotic and pornographic sources gain legitimacy in this scenario as they address some of the needs and concerns of young people. Adapted from the source document.

Sex Differences in Mental Health of Older People

Author: Lai, Daniel W L1; Ip, Conita K C1 Faculty Social Work, U Calgary, Alberta dlai@ucalgary.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61371914?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the differences in mental health between older men & women. A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted with a representative sample of 504 older adults aged 55 years & older. Mental health was measured by a revised Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale & the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of a Chinese version of SF-36. Mental health differences between men & women were not identified, but gender was found to have an effect on mental health in the 54 to 64 age group, when being a female predicted a poorer status of mental health. The poorer financial status of women was the reason for the gender effect. Mental health predictors for men & women were also compared. The findings concluded that interventions to strengthen financial assistance for aging women were important for enhancing mental health. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Both local & overseas studies affirm that bullying in schools is very prevalent. The overseas experiences in response to bullying are invaluable for local reference. There is a consensus that a whole-school approach & a live policy against bullying are essential for successful intervention. There are different strategies in responses to cases of bullying including the No Blame Approach, the Method of Shared Concern, the Restorative Justice Approach & the Use of Logical Consequences. The authors argue for a mixed approach. Special issues in tackling bullying in Hong Kong are raised. Finally, it is advocated that a safe school is a prerequisite for a harmonious school. References.

Author: Mahalingam, Kamini

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61389500?accountid=14925

Abstract: Cataract -- a disease related to old age -- can be surgically treated. This article evaluates the quality of visual outcome & client satisfaction for cataract surgeries done in a district & barriers to seeking treatment for the un-operated persons. The reasons given for barriers to treatment were (a) no information, (b) no one to accompany, & (c) expensive treatment costs. Measures to create awareness, closing the gender gap, & taking a closer look at the reasons for the poor uptake can be of importance. Tables, Figures, Appendixes, References.

Confidentiality, Stigma, Discrimination and Voluntary Disclosures

Author: Mulye, Rama1; Raja, Tasneem; Menon, M; Pereire, Joe; Barnes, B L1 Kripa Rehabilitation Center, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61386736?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study attempted to analyse the prevalence & experiences of stigma, discrimination & confidentiality issues, as well as voluntary disclosure & partner notification in HIV-infected patients. The sample consisted of 43 people living with HIV/AIDS receiving treatment & follow-up services at the Vasal Regional AIDS Control Society, a home-based care facility run by Kripa Rehabilitation Centre, Mumbai. They were evaluated on a questionnaire tapping key areas of health, employment, family & reproductive life, & social living, along with an interview schedule to tap various issues of partner notification & disclosure. The obtained results showed that the patients mainly experienced discrimination in health care settings. Discrimination at the workplace & in areas of family & reproductive life & social living was minimal. Incidence of tension/anxiety/fear/sadness/despair & other psychological symptoms were predominantly experienced by all the patients. An overwhelming majority did not want to disclose their serostatus for fear of judgmental attitudes, ridicule & insults from friends, co-workers, & relatives. The status was revealed only to the spouse or to the doctors. It is the fear of stigma & discrimination that had impacted these patients in availing the health care facility & support from their significant others. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Problems Faced by the Tribal Students in Education

Author: Pathania, Raj1; Kaur, Praveen; Pathania, Pawan1 Dept Human Development & Family Studies, Choudhary Sarwan Kumar Himachal Pradesch Krishi Vidyapeeth, Palampur, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61363954?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study was undertaken with the objective of assessing the problems faced by tribal adolescents of Himachal Pradesh (HP) in getting education. The study was conducted in the three tribal districts of HP -- Kinnaur (Kinnaura community), Lahaul & Spiti (Bhot community), & Chamba (Gaddi community). The respondents were 300 adolescents (150 males & 150 females) in the age group of 15-20 years who were administered a self-structured schedule. Duncan's test of multiple ranges, beside frequency & percentages were calculated. The findings portrayed that home constraints were perceived as medium-level constraints, whereas physical facilities in the classroom, non-availability of books, & stress & fears experienced at school, were high level constraints. The findings of the present study also showed that the Bhot respondents perceived home, school, personal & community constraints more than the Gaddi & Kinnaur respondents & were significantly different from other two communities. Non-significant differences were observed in the perception of constraints among high, medium & low income group respondents, except in the teacher's behaviour, stress & fear experienced at school &, in community constraints, where high income group respondents perceived these constraints more than the respondents belonging to low & medium income groups.

The Killing Fields: Farmers' Suicides in Maharashtra

Author: Dandekar, Ajay11 Rural Campus, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Tuljapur, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61364015?accountid=14925

Abstract: The spate of suicides in Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka & Maharashtra -- coupled with the declining share of agriculture in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) & increasing burden on the agrarian system -- belies the lofty, almost ideal, claims put forth in the National Policy on Agriculture. These suicides point to a greater crisis in the agrarian system, as a whole, where the suicide is a symptom of a greater malaise that threatens millions of farmers & the landless agricultural labourers in the subcontinent. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Chalise, Hom Nath1; Shreshta, Sajan1 Dept Social Gerontology, School Health Sciences & Nursing, Graduate School Medicine, U Tokyo, Japan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61349064?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although population ageing is now regarded as a world-wide priority, research in this field is just beginning in Nepal. The objective of this paper is to examine the socioeconomic & health status of the elderly in Nepal, specifically those living in Kathmandu. A total of 121 elderly individuals were interviewed from Kathmandu. Our findings show that majority of the elderly reported serious health problems in the last one year; most of the elderly lived with their children; a significantly higher number of elderly women lived alone as compared to men; & the monthly income of the elderly was significantly low. 5 Tables, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

What Is the Relation between Human Practical Action and an Accompanying Discourse? Discussing the Status of Practical Theory

Author: Brinkkjaer, Ulf1; Norholm, Morten1 Dept Educational Sociology, Danmarks Paedagogiske U, Kobenhavn ulf@dpu.dk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393471?accountid=14925

Abstract: An important part of the discussion of the relation between theory and practice seems not to forget what practice is. This discussion often becomes rather 'theoretical' or 'philosophical', tending first of all to focus on speculative (that is ideological) interpretations of the word 'theory'. This underscores the importance of not losing oneself in discussions of different forms of theory, or in discussions of what ought to be regarded as 'proper' theory. Instead it seems important to concentrate on a much more important issue: What is practice? What does practice consist of? The present article tries to develop this discussion. References.

Globalisation, E-learning and the Monetary Pressure on the Educational Field

Author: Angiletta, Salvatore-Pasquale11 ZMML -- Centre Multimedia Higher Education, U Bremen, Germany angilletta@zmml.uni-bremen.de

Abstract: Globalisation, this is my thesis, change first the trade of goods and services, produce a mercantilist pressure on different political fields and affect finally as a consequence effectively our normative comprehension of education. As states will be more and more under pressure to compete on an economic basis against each other they will rank decisions which generate jobs higher than any thing else. Also Education policy is changing its focus. E-learning is a driving force to bring together education, trade of ICT equipment, trade of educational used content and trade of study degrees and to merge the different objectives into effective distribution of knowledge and maximising profits.

Risks and Responsibilities? The Individualisation of Youth Transitions and the Ambivalence between Participation and Activation in Europe

Author: Walther, Andreas11 Dept Social Pedagogy, U Tubingen, Germany Andreas.Walther@uni-tuebingen.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368333?accountid=14925

Abstract: This report provides insight on the situation facing young people in contemporary European societies in their transitions to work and citizenship. On the one hand, risks of exclusion have increased, while on the other, responsibilities for coping with such risks have been individualised, a state of affairs reinforced by the trend towards activation labour market policies. Drawing on the findings of a EU-funded study across nine European regions, the report gives evidence of the resulting biographical and policy dilemmas. Furthermore, it explores if and under what conditions the concept of participation may open new ways of reconciling systemic imperatives and individual needs in the social integration of young people.

Integrating a Traditional Minority into a Nordic Society: Elite Discourse on the Finnish Roma

Author: Nordberg, Camilla11 Dept Social Policy, Abo Academi U, Finland camilla.nordberg@abo.fi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393508?accountid=14925

Abstract: Contemporary citizenship studies have been more concerned with the theory & philosophy of citizenship than with empirical studies. The general objective of this contribution is to broaden the understanding of how notions of citizenship are constructed & re-valued in the social world. The study draws on a qualitative analysis of political elite discourse on Romani issues in the Finnish Parliament from 1989-2003. How issues concerning the Roma are debated elucidates the dilemmas of universal rights & duties within the Nordic welfare model, & the possibilities for cultural diversity within this framework. While the Finnish parliamentary debate accentuated tolerance & the acceptance of difference as strengthening factors for Finnish social citizenship, it was not before the new millennium that the political discourse changed to increasingly stress notions of discrimination & structural inequalities in relation to the incapability to provide for a full an inclusive citizenship as regards the Romani minority.

Child Care Alternatives Adopted by Mothers Working Nightshifts

Author: Gokhale, Jayanti11 Faculty Arya Vidya Mandir Education, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374970?accountid=14925

Abstract: Industrialised & urban societies have increasingly drawn women into the labour force as night shift workers. However, while childcare during the day has received considerable attention, childcare at night remains an unexplored area of investigation. The present paper, thus, aims to explore childcare alternatives within & outside the family, when mothers work nightshifts. Given the exploratory nature & survey design of the present study, 250 staff nurses were interviewed with an in depth interview schedule as a tool for investigation. The findings highlight that within the family, husbands are the main caretakers of children at night, other than mothers or mothers-in law. Outside the family, the respondent nurses depended on maids, friends & the community for childcare at night where the quality of childcare remains unsatisfactory. The need for a 24-hour quality childcare service within the community or at the place of employment is emphasised. 2 Tables, 58 References. Adapted from the source document.

Sexuality Research and the Position of the Researcher

Author: Genesh, Indira Maya

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61517702?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article emphasizes that research in sexuality requires many new dimensions -- more creativity & debate, a deeper & more realistic approach to understand the psychology of human personal growth & the anatomy of risk behavior. This will focus attention on the reduction of HIV transmission & the advocacy of a healthy lifestyle. This article addresses three key aspects of sexuality research: locating the nature & practice of sexuality within the accepted norms, finding methods to expand our knowledge of sexuality, & the role of the researcher in translating psycho-sociological theory to the reality of people's lived experiences. The study represents the work of Interventions for Support, Healing & Awareness (IFSHA's) in the field of gender violence, child sexual abuse, sexuality through workshops, counseling & healing & research. It advocates that the researcher develop a language of emotion that fits in with the language of theory. Class & cultural differences have to be taken into account while developing the language of sexuality. Besides, while working with varied target groups, the intervenor has to be able to maintain both neutrality & distance. This calls for a deep understanding of one's own psyche & sexuality. The article suggests that a support system be developed. 3 References. Adapted from the source document.

Concept of Sex and Sexual Behaviour among Young Men

Author: Murthy, Nirmala1; Vasan, Akhila1 Foundation Research Health Systems, Bangalore, Karnataka, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61541313?accountid=14925

Abstract: This exploratory study carried out in Bangalore, an urban city in South India & Nagar, a semi-rural town in Western India, looks at the concept of sex & sexual behavior of young men, between the ages of 20 & 24. The article finds many similarities in young men's concept of sex & sexual behavior across locations as well as certain critical differences. Their concepts were dominated by physical sexual acts & excluded emotional content. Both groups sought sexual pleasure without responsibilities -- either of contraception, marriage or of protection against disease. But most information, education & communication (IEC) campaigns stress on aspects that young men consider not pleasurable postponing sex, using condoms, having one sexual partner or practicing non-penetrative sex. Urban respondents' concept seemed somewhat more amenable to safe sex practices because their concept of "real sex" included non-penetrative sexual acts as well as masturbation. But the peri-urban respondents' concept of sex combined multi-partner sex with penetrative sexual acts. The IEC interventions will need to take these differences into account. The article also underscores the importance of using peer groups to reach out to young men &, therefore, the need to understand the nature, composition & dynamics of these peer groups. 2 Tables, 7 Boxes, 3 References.

Sexuality and Reproductive Health: A Conceptual Model and Policy Implications

Author: Mahadevan, K; Raju, S Siva; Jayasree, R; Rani, P M Sandhya

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61517676?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study focuses on factors that affect the sexuality of a diverse population. The conceptual model has been formulated based on available literature, interaction with the key players -- behavioral scientists, & peripheral health & family planning workers -- & evaluative studies carried out among sex workers. There is a critical analysis of the direct & indirect relationship of the causal factors with the dependent variables. Several dimensions of sexual behavior have been looked into, especially patterns of premarital & extramarital sex. Independent variables such as physiological & lifestyle variables & their impact on sexual behavior & patterns have been studied. Sexual restraints such as celibacy & chastity & the influence of religion on sexuality have been discussed. The study focuses on familial & marital variables, which exercise restraint on the sexual practices of adolescents & youth. The effect of poverty on prostitution, the influence of mass media on sexuality & the role of modernization, migration & isolation on extramarital sexual practices of married couples have been discussed. Sexual degeneration & rejuvenation have also been discussed. This conceptual model underlines the importance of a holistic study of sexuality, sexual behavior & patterns, so that suitable policies & interventions can be identified to promote permissible & safe sex on the one hand & prevention of HIV/AIDS & sexually transmitted diseases on the other. 4 References.

Womanhood and Spirituality: A Journey between Transcendence and Tradition

Author: Nayar, Usha S11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61526020?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article focuses on how women in the past & women in contemporary India have chosen the path of spirituality, & how Indian culture has positioned women vis-a-vis spirituality. It explores female spirituality in a patriarchal paradigm through women like Sita, Meera, Savitri & Kannagi, who faced humiliation & hostility, but who tread the path of single-minded devotion to their principles & thus combined the feminine principle of grace with tenacity, steadfastness of purpose, vision & character. These prototypes inspire & guide the women in India even today & the article illustrates this through contemporary profiles in courage. The article stresses on the fact that in the Hindu pantheon of gods & goddesses, every god has a goddess, & as the form of Ardhanaareeshwara, the fusion of Shiva & Shakti in one body, denotes, male & female principles work together as equal partners in the universe. Other instances reiterate that in ancient India, women occupied a very important position. While analyzing the spirituality of women as a cultural expression, the study underlines the fact that the Hindu version of the Mother image has manifested itself in the vision of Bharat Mata & underlines the fact that spirituality mediates relationships. It heals, provides succor to the emotionally needy, physically abused, & rebuilds fundamental trust in oneself. The modern approach to spirituality, according to this study, defines it as a means of reaching equilibrium or harmony through gender equality. 1 Reference. Adapted from the source document.

Sexual Behaviour and HIV/AIDS Related Implications

Author: Somayajulu, U V11 TNS India, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61560747?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is based on the data collected for a study carried out in Andhra Pradesh to understand the sexual behavior of the population sub-groups -- adult males, male students & fishermen & the HIV/AIDS related implications thereof. The study used qualitative techniques such as focus group discussions, & in depth interviews & quantitative structured interviews. The findings of the qualitative study revealed that there was poor awareness of AIDS in rural areas. Most of the respondents were aware of the sexual transmission of AIDS & that the clients of commercial social workers carried high risk of AIDS. On the whole, the target groups covered exhibited high risk sexual behavior. The married respondents reported premarital & extramarital sexual practices & there was little or no practice of safe sex. The major constraints for the use of condoms in these sub-groups were lack of satisfaction & lack of knowledge. The study concludes that there is an urgent need to educate these sub-groups about safe sex practices, consistent use of condoms, preventive care & non-penetrative sex practices. 4 Tables, 2 References.

Sexual Behaviour of Adolescent Sex Workers

Author: Krishnakumari, K11 Dept Demography, U Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61517574?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article focuses on adolescent sexual behavior & reasons leading to an early introduction to sexual life. The many types of adolescent sexual behavior, the reasons for adolescents indulging in the sexual act, the use of contraceptives & the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among them are examined. A baseline survey was conducted in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, & Kozhikode in Kerala state, & 825 children were identified to be engaged in the sex trade. The methods used were observation, focus group discussions & interviews with key informants & informal discussions & interviews with experts on adolescent sex workers (ASWs). The study found that a complex interplay of economic, social, cultural, religious, familial, psychological & environmental factors led the children into the sex trade. The children are mainly from a poor economic background. Penury & inharmonious family relations are the main factors that drive children into a life of social depravity. The most exploited ASWs are those who operate in streets & lodges. Most ASWs are at the mercy of caretakers & pimps who abuse the children physically & monetarily. Their awareness of the consequence of pregnancies, abortions, sexual health, STDs, MDS & HIV is very poor. The study recommends that awareness should be created among ASWs regarding their sexual health & among all social strata on issues like gender roles, sexual & domestic violence, communication & negotiation skills. 16 Tables.

Sexual Behaviour of Commercial Sex Workers and Risk in Reproductive Health

Author: Jayasree, R1; Parvathy, K A1 Dept Women's Studies, Sri Padmavathi Mahila U, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61534598?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article attempts to study the sexual behavior of commercial sex workers & risk in reproductive health including sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) & HIV/AIDS. The data was generated from 200 female sex workers in Tirupati, in Chittoor district of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. For collection of data, an interview schedule was prepared on the basis of focus group discussions. The profile of the female sex workers included social & demographic variables such as religion, caste, education, age, age at marriage, current marital status, age of entry into the profession, & years in this profession. The respondents were mainly underprivileged women belonging to the lower socioeconomic strata. The reasons for their entry into the profession were mainly poverty, related economic burden, dissolution of marriage, desertion by husband, lack of education, & lack of alternate job opportunities. The study revealed that these women lost a major share of their earnings to brokers/pimps & the police & they faced harassment & sexual exploitation. The article advocates intervention programs that focus on creating awareness about safe sex & condom use, skill training for income-generating activities, & efforts to integrate STD/HIV/AIDS prevention activities with other ongoing activities such as non-formal education, training in economic activities, micro-enterprise, education & care for their children & free legal aid. 6 Tables, 9 References.

From Research to Action: Addressing Masculinty and Gender Norms

Author: Verma, Ravi K1; Mahendra, Vaishali S; Pulerwitz, Julie; Barker, Gary T; Van Dam, Johannes; Flessenkaemper, Sabine1 Population Council, Horizons Program, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61534535?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study is an intervention research to reduce HIV/AIDS risk behavior among youth by developing & testing a model of behavior change focused on masculinity & the promotion of equitable gender norms among young men in India. The study aims to test the hypothesis that more equitable gender norms will predict less HIV risk. It also aims to develop, test & evaluate the efficacy of a peer- & community-based intervention that addresses masculinity & gender norms among young men & reduces risk behavior. A range of qualitative methods were used to collect data on various aspects of young men's lifestyle, the context of their sexual behavior & associated beliefs & attitudes. Social mapping exercises helped identify key informants. Educational modules based on experiences & tools generated in Brazil by Instituto Promundo were adapted to the Indian situation. Many respondents felt that they were "feeling better" after sharing their personal concerns with the research team members. The study concludes that through the process of owning, sharing & relationship building, young men can be persuaded to change their behavior & acquire gender equitable attitudes. 14 References.

Abstract: Clients with psychosis & record of violence has long been a challenge for social work interventions. Workers tend to insert social control by involuntary hospitalization & medical treatment. Based on a strengths perspective & by means of a case illustration, this paper shows that clients' delusion & hallucination are meaningful. Violent behaviours & outbreaks are predictable & related with stress in clients' psychosocial environments. Once their capabilities & strengths are properly developed, they can recover & enjoy a normal life as other persons in the society. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: With reference to the territory-wide household survey data that was obtained from 1988 to 2001, this paper tries to analyze the poverty problem in Hong Kong before & after the hand-over. Our data clearly shows that in the past one & a half decades, the poverty problem has become worst. In comparison with the well-off families, respondents who came from the poorer families have become more dissatisfied with the living environment, the working situation, economic prospectus as well as the administration of the government. If the government would not take effective action to solve this worsening poverty problem, the foundation of the territory's social stability will be threatened. Figures, References.

Abstract: This article compared two crisis management models. One of the models -- 'crisis management practice model' is formulated from the practical crisis management experiences of the integrated home care service center during the SARS attack in 2003. It is based on the service delivery in the two most affected areas, the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate & the Amoy Garden. The other model is a four-phase 'crisis management conceptual process model' developed by Gonzalez Herrerom & Pratt (1995). The practice model is further consolidated, enriched & refined in view of the Gonzalez Herrerom & Pratt's model to integrate the conceptual & practical aspects. Its applicability can be extended to other crisis caused by outbreak from other infectious diseases. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Tackling Discrimination against Ethnic Minorities: The Case of Post-Colonial Hong Kong

Author: Tang, Kwang-Leung1; Lam, Mong Chow; Ngai, Steven Sek-Yum1 Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin

Abstract: Ethnic & racial minorities living in Asia face widespread racial discrimination. The case of post-colonial Hong Kong is illustrative of racial discrimination encountered by racial groups as well as the effective use of international law in tackling racial discrimination. Wary of business opposition to the introduction of antidiscrimination legislation, the Hong Kong post-colonial government played down the severity of racial discrimination against migrant workers & ethnic minority groups. Social workers, advocates & legal professionals drew upon the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in their campaigns against racial discrimination. As a result of their activism, & pressure from the United Nations, the post-colonial government is set to introduce a law against racial discrimination in the year 2004. The Convention proves to be an impetus to legislation against racial discrimination. Social workers in Asia have an obligation to advance the rights of ethnic minorities in their daily practice. They have an important role to play in ensuring that their governments comply with international human rights standards. 2 Tables, 47 References. Adapted from the source document.

Work-Related Stress among Health Professionals and Coping Mechanisms

Author: K. S., Latha11 Dept Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical Coll Hospital, Manipal, Karnataka, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61515554?accountid=14925

Abstract: The rationale for studying clinical environments is based on the assumption that negative environmental factors impinge on clinicians & result in negative client-clinician interaction & outcome. Negative effects of the clinical environment are factors such as stress, job dissatisfaction & burn-out. This article focuses on these factors among health professionals, including mental health professionals. It further deals with interventions to remedy negative environmental factors. The role of an environmental support like 'clinical supervision', which is supposed to have a positive buffering effect on environmental factors, has been discussed. 85 References.

Within this emerging international system, the continued development of technology will require convergent integrated systems, a decline in the concept of territorialism, & the further development of the concept of international intellectual property rights.

Comparative Analyses of Child and Youth Services in Europe

Author: Seckinger, Mike1; van Santen, Eric; Pluto, Liane1 Deutsches Jugendinstit e.V. Munchen

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61403490?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper contains a comparative evaluation of the reactions of welfare states to the isomorphic pressures emanating from the European Union based on two case studies taken from the Child & Youth Welfare System. In the European Community different concepts of welfare policy exist. In the unification process, every member state has to find answers to the pressure of assimilation invoked by the legislation. The objective of this explorative study is to show that countries can learn from each other in order to improve their own system of social services. References. Adapted from the source document.

Youth Work and Schools in 'Full-Day' Education Systems: International Comparison of Links between Formal and Non-Formal Education

Author: Coelen, Thomas11 Instit Allgemeine & Sozialpadagogik, U Rostock thomas.coelen@uni-rostock.de

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382285?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article I will outline the methodological approach of a non-empirical comparative research project which I began in 2003. The project is situated in the context of the research training group "Youth Welfare in Transition" at the universities of Bielefeld & Dortmund, funded by the German Research Council (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft). In that context I have organised an international conference about the modes of cooperation between school & youth work agencies with colleagues from Canada, France, Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, & Germany. Meeting in Bielefeld from the 9th to the 11th of October 2003, we compared the respective national arrangements of formal & non-formal education (www.uni-bielefeld.de/paedagogik/agn/ag8/Ganztagsbildung. html). This note is based on the scheme of comparison which was given to the contributors in order to help them preparing their presentations. References. Adapted from the source document.

New Security Threats for Humanitarian Aid Workers

Author: Runge, Peter11 VENRO, Bonn p.runge@venro.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61403448?accountid=14925

Abstract: Two recent events in Afghanistan & Iraq highlight the current security threats for humanitarian aid workers: Firstly, in July 2004 the humanitarian aid organisation Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) stopped its operations in Afghanistan. This decision followed the targeted killing of five MSF aid workers in Northwestern Afghanistan in June 2004, a brutal act unprecedented in the organisation's history. Afghanistan has become a dangerous place for aid workers: Since March 2003 more than 30 humanitarian aid workers have been killed. Secondly, in September 2004 the so-called "two Simonas," staff members of the Italian non-governmental organization (NGO) "Un ponte per Bagdad" (A Bridge for Baghdad) were abducted in Iraq but, fortunately, released in October 2004. Around 130 foreigners have been seized in Iraq in a wave of abductions that began in April. Most have been released, but around 30 have been killed. Due to the tense security situation in Iraq all the expatriate staff members of Western NGOs have been evacuated in the last months. References. Adapted from the source document.

An Insight into the Actual Socio-Economic Situation of Romania

Author: Bela, Szabo11 Babes-Bolyai U, Cluj, Romania eszbe@hotmail.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61377641?accountid=14925

Abstract: Approximately half of the population population experience some degree of poverty while 10% live in extreme poverty (according to a report made by the Ministry of Labor, Social Solidarity & Family -- MLSSF). This poverty has grown rapidly over the transition decade. Real wages, already amongst the lowest in Europe (including Central & Eastern Europe) in 1990, have since declined by approximately half. A high proportion of households, mostly those in rural areas, are engaged in informal economic activity such as small-scale farming, & it is estimated that at least one third of household incomes are in kind. High levels of poverty in the country tend to be associated with families of more than three children. The only ethnic group with a markedly distinct level of poverty is the Roma, who collectively experience 3.5 times the average poverty rate. Poverty appears to be up to half as prevalent again in rural areas (where over 45% of the population live) compared to the urban areas, as there is also some regional concentration, often associated with declining of industrial activity.

Sexual Harassment of Women at the Workplace: A Socio-Legal Study

Author: Das, Bharat Bhusan1; Padhy, Sunanda1 Dept Law, Berhampur U, Orissa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61542880?accountid=14925

Abstract: The dimensions of violence against women, especially at the workplace has been concealed for so long that its seriousness had not attracted the attention of the legislators. In spite of growing awareness of the concepts & need for gender justice, there has been, in recent times, an increasing trend of sexual harassment of women at the workplace. In the presence of these inadequacies in the enacted laws for enforcement of basic human rights against sexual harassment in the workplace & as an answer to the growing menace of sexual harassment at the workplace, this paper seek to explore the pervasiveness of the problem & to examine how far the innovative judicial law making progress have contributed in providing protection of women from sexual harassment at the workplace. 11 References.

Abstract: This article deals with the impact of self help groups, promoted by eight leading nongovernment organizations in two southern states of India, namely Tamil Nadu & Andhra Pradesh. All these organizations come under a partnership program promoted by the Development Promotion Group (DPG, Chennai) with financial support from EED, Germany. The study has revealed that women's groups have succeeded in reversing the gender relations in their favor & proved that they can effectively replace the leadership in local institutions & provide better governance to the community. 7 References.

How Do Hong Kong Children React to Maternal I-Messages and Inductive Reasoning?

Author: Cheung, Siu-kau1; Kwok, Sylvia Y C1 Division Social Studies, City U Hong Kong, Kowloon S.K.cheung@cityu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61499103?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study investigated the affective reactions (unhappiness, animosity, & compassion) & behavioral tendencies (antagonistic & conciliatory) of Chinese children to four kinds of maternal communicative behaviors, namely, I-message revealing primary feelings, I-message revealing anger, You-message implying moralizing, & You-message implying criticizing. The sample was composed of 527 Chinese students studying at primary four to form three in Hong Kong. Participants rated their affective reactions & behavioral tendencies to videotaped parent disciplinary messages. Results showed that children are most receptive to mothers' I-messages revealing parental distress, next comes You-messages in the form of inductive reasoning, then I-messages revealing anger whereas they are most antagonistic toward You-messages implying criticizing.

The Agonising Plight of Orphans of War: A National Survey

Author: Reddy, Suma Narayan11 Ministry Labour & Human Welfare, Asmara, Eritrea

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61537421?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article reports about the important findings of a national survey on disadvantaged orphans in Eritrea, one among the 15 poorest countries of the world. Thousands of children were made orphans owing to the long drawn out war situation this country had been gripped with. The survey is an attempt to unearth the background characteristics of these disadvantaged orphans, the circumstances of parental loss, their living situations, & the various problems encountered by them. The present survey is based on 50,782 disadvantaged orphans where the majority of the orphans were paternal orphans followed by maternal orphans, & a few were complete orphans. They belonged to extremely poor families, & suffered from all kinds of deprivations, including schooling opportunities, medical care, food, & clothing, apart from social & psychological problems of various kinds. A few of them were further affected by disabilities & chronic health problems. Analysis indicated that various factors such as loss of one parent or both, age, availability of adult care & type of care, economic status, schooling opportunity, age at loss of mother, cause of mother's death, & health status seemed to contribute to the vulnerability of these orphans. 3 Tables, 2 Appendixes, 25 References.

Author: Mishra, Arun K1; Mattoo, Surendra K; Babu, Debashish1 Dept Psychiatry, Postgraduate Instit Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61514380?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is based on the experience gained during 14-15 years of follow-up of patients with psychotic disorders & the experience of organizing a rural de-addiction service. The article highlights the different aspects related to community psychiatry projects under preparatory, intake & follow-up or evaluation phases. It is observed that the achievement of aims & objectives of any community psychiatry project is contingent on full understanding of the community in terms of its needs, & material & non-material resources, & the resources available to the study team. The article also deals, in detail, with both organizational aspects & amount & type of training requirements. The importance of the follow-up or the evaluation phase in the final outcome of any community psychiatry project is highlighted in the background of locating & interviewing strategies used for different segments of the community. Lastly, some practical advice is listed for the beginners. 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

Human Rights Issue in Family Counselling and Advocacy

Author: Kanango, Sukla Deb11 Dept Social Work, Visva Bharati, Sriniketan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61542937?accountid=14925

Abstract: While the goal of family counseling is to strengthen family units, counselors are often confronted with the issue of violation of human rights whose origin is sometimes the family, & sometimes the external environment. Determination of acts as violation of rights, particularly at the family level, becomes complex because of cultural connotations these have. This article seeks to focus on the various implications the violation of human rights have for counseling families & how advocacy can play a complementary role in this. 8 References.

Author: Ahn, Bonnie11 Social Work Program, Southeastern Louisiana U, Hammond

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61563084?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined various demographic characteristics, the attitudes toward partner abuse, & the relationship between the attitudes toward partner abuse & the incidence of partner abuse among first-generation Korean Americans. The study employed a correlational explanatory design using a cross-sectional survey technique utilizing a total of 223 Korean immigrant adults currently residing in Baton Rouge, LA, US. A three-part instrument was used for data collection. The use of domestic violence among Korean immigrants was highly prevalent. Korean Americans generally did not approve the use of interpersonal violence against spouses/partners. The relationship between the attitudes toward partner abuse & the incidence of partner abuse as perpetrator was significantly correlated. 3 Tables, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Throughout these years of practical experience, the writers discovered that the formation & function of these social support networks were greatly affected by the Chinese social orientation, as suggested by Yang (1995). In this paper, the writers list all these culturally based practical experiences in detail. 22 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Debates and Repositioning of Community Service Orders in Hong Kong

Author: Lo, T Wing11 Dept Applied Social Studies, City U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61455520?accountid=14925

Abstract: Sentencing has various objectives & functions, including reparation, rehabilitation, reintegration, retribution, deterrence, & removal from society, such as incarceration. Community service orders incorporate the first three functions. They assist offenders to make reparation to society for the crimes they have committed, to turn over a new leaf, & to reintegrate into society. In the case of singer Nicholas Tse, the last three functions were demanded by the community. To avoid similar conflicts in the future, to reposition community service orders is inevitable. There is an urgent need to reiterate community service orders as alternatives to imprisonment, & to establish a clear guideline for conversion between service hours & jail days. This approach would minimize conflicts in society, increase sentencing options & community penalties for the court, strike a balance between different penal goals, & strive for a restorative society. 27 References.

Psychological Well-Being of Newly Arrived and Locally Born Adolescents in Hong Kong: A Comparative Study

Author: Lam, Mong Chow1; Tsoi, Kcon Wah; Chan, Ting Sam1 Dept Social Work, Chinese U Hong Kong alam@cuhk.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61518814?accountid=14925

Abstract: Reports on a study that explores the psychological health of young new arrivals in Hong Kong from mainland China as compared to students born in Hong Kong. Measures used to assess psychological well-being/psychological symptoms are described, along with two new measures developed specifically for this study: the 19-item Adolescent Self-Positioning Index for measuring adolescents' self-concept, & the Index of Adolescents' Contentment with Hong Kong Living. Data were obtained from a self-reported questionnaire completed by 1,109 Hong Kong-born students aged 12 to 15, & 342 respondents, aged 12-15, who were born in Mainland China but had been residing legally in Hong Kong between one & three years. The findings indicated that the psychological functioning of the new arrivals was generally better than that of locally born youth. These results are inconsistent with the conventional belief that new arrivals have trouble coping with life in Hong Kong & are a source of societal problems. The implications are discussed. 14 References. J. Lindroth

Missing Older Persons with Dementia -- A Hong Kong View

Author: Lai, Claudia K Y1; Chung, Jenny C C; Wong, Thomas K S; Faulkner, Lawrence W; Ng, Louise; Lau, Liam K P1 School Nursing, Faculty Health & Social Sciences, Hong Kong Polytechnic U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61550027?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper reviews missing person incidents that occurred in older persons with dementia reported in local newspapers from 1 January 1999 to 1 May 2002. Ten relevant incidents, two of which happened to the same person, were found in WiseNews, an electronic database of 21 local newspapers. There were four (44%) males & five (56%) females with a mean age of 77 (standard deviation = 5). In six (60%) cases, the missing persons eloped from home & four (40%) outside of home. Nine (90%) of the cases required less than a day to three days to locate the missing person. Six (60%) cases resulted in injuries or death due to falls or traffic accidents. It is not uncommon for dementia patients to get lost. Public awareness & understanding of the phenomenon is very important because the survival of missing persons depends on the implementation of timely & effective search & rescue. This analysis confirms the need for a prospective study to further examine the characteristics of missing older adults & missing incidents, as well as the search strategies adopted by caregivers. 1 Table, 16 References.

Blighted Spaces and the Politics of Everyday Life

Author: Fairbanks, Robert P, II11 School Social Work, U Pennsylvania, Philadelphia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375041?accountid=14925

Abstract: While a great deal is known about the demographic and historical trends that shape the built environment of American cities, much less is known about the politics of everyday life among residents who continue to live in postindustrial neighborhoods. This study seeks to compensate for the current gaps in academic research by conducting spatially informed ethnography in a North Philadelphia community. Specifically, the study will explore the issue of urban "blight" from a cultural geography perspective, primarily by looking at the ways in which "blighted" spaces shape everyday life, and everyday life in turn shapes and produces the spatial environment. In response to these concerns, my study poses the questions: What would it mean to focus on the ways in which human agency, imagination, and subjectivity are shaped by "blighted" geographical locations? What would it mean to pay ethnographic attention to how subjects in given historical conditions are shaped by "blighted" spaces, as well as how they respond to these spaces in culturally specific ways? By incorporating critical interdisciplinary approaches, this study offers a new way of looking at the various practices of daily life -- including flexible, informal economic activities and post-welfare related "lifestyles" of resistance. Through the lens of spatial ethnography, the study seeks to elucidate the ways in which postindustrial space interacts with culture, poverty and addiction; as well as the ways in which users continue to appropriate postindustrial spaces in culturally meaningful ways under the aegis of the semi-welfare state.

Gender -- An Issue for German Welfare Organisation

Author: Lange, Chris

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380095?accountid=14925

Abstract: During the last months and years the English expression 'gender' has become a well-known word all over Germany, often with the annex 'mainstreaming'. Gender mainstreaming was initiated as a political strategy by the Women's World Conference in Beijing in 1995 and adopted by the European Union in 1997 (COM(96)76 final). It basically means that all actions and initiatives planned have to be tested as to their effects on women and men and should not be taken if they disadvantage either one. But gender is also a category in the discussion about democratic features. Gender democracy means that males and females should be represented equally in the public, political, cultural, social and economic sphere of a society. On this background, this paper traces the gender issue in the field of organizations in the social sector of Germany, in particular the 'welfare organizations'. In this article, 'welfare organizations' is used as a translation of the German word 'Wohlfahrtsverbande'. The reason for this choice is the endeavor to indicate their difference from for instance English 'charitable associations' or French 'associations sociale et sanitaire', because social organizations in the EU-member states differ considerably in regard to their history, function, self-image, financing, political power etc. The terms 'social non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) or 'social nonprofit organizations' (NPOs) are used synonymously.

Problem Solving Policing: Views of Citizens and Citizens Expectations in Germany

Author: Weitekamp, Elmar G M; Kerner, Hans-Jurgen; Meier, Ulrike

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61396053?accountid=14925

Abstract: For the last two decades American police experts developed new police philosophies in order to tackle more successful the increasing crime problems. Community Policing tries to improve the cooperation between the population and the police & to increase the trust in the police. A crucial factor is a meaningful cooperation between the police & the citizens. Problem Oriented Policing aims at structural changes in the organisation & the procedures of the police in public. The police have to investigate the hidden problems & conflicts of an individual offence & to create proactive & long term concepts for the social area of conflicts beyond the specific case. It is doubtful whether these philosophies can be implemented in Germany since the legality principle prohibits meaningful, trustworthy relationships between citizens & police officers. However, if one examines the results of surveys on citizens views & expectations towards the police one finds that the majority of the German citizens favour the postulates of community & problem oriented policing. They expect through these measures an improvement of their life situation in the community & the feelings of safety. If one takes these results seriously one has to question if the legality principle is still appropriate. It seems to hamper new, more promising policing styles which seem to improve life of it's citizens & reflect what the citizens want & expect from their police force. Figures, References.

Role of Motivation and Cognition on School Performance of High-School Students: A Structural Analysis

Author: Yailagh, Manizheh Sheni11 Dept Education & Psychology, Shahid Chamran U, Ahwaz, Iran

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61451941?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports a path analysis examining the causal relationships among goal setting, self-efficacy, learning strategies, & prior performance on final achievement of high school students in Ahwaz, Iran. Questionnaires assessing goal setting (Students' Grade Goals, & Parents' Grade Goals), self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy for Self-Regulated Learning, & Self-Efficacy for Academic Achievement), & learning strategies (Cognitive Strategy Use & Self-Regulation), were administered to 148 randomly selected Iranian high school students. Structural path analysis was employed to examine the relationships among variables. The results show that the paths of self-efficacy with learning strategies & goal setting, the paths of goal setting with prior & final grades, & the path of prior grades with final grades were significant, thus supporting social cognitive theory of motivation. The only non-significant path was between learning strategies & final grades. The probable reasons for this latter finding are discussed in the paper. 2 Tables, 2 Figures, 19 References.

Indian Families Adopting Indian Children

Author: Groza, Victor1; Kalyanvala, Roxana; Bharatiya Samaj Seva Kendra Team1 Mandel School Applied Social Sciences, Case Western Reserve U, Cleveland, OH

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61451945?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to provide research-based information about the experiences of Indian families who adopted Indian children as part of program evaluation of the Bharatiya Samaj Seva Kendra. The project was designed primarily as a program evaluation. Both a mailed survey & face-to-face interviews were used to collect data for this study. This article reports only on the data obtained from the mailed survey. The study reveals that more information is needed to build support & capacity for Indian adoptions. More families need to be recruited to meet the demands for placement of children who cannot reside with their birth families. Community marketing & public relations would strengthen the domestic adoption program. There is a critical need for public education campaigns that present accurate information about adoption, adoptive parents, & adoptees. This must include working with the media to provide this information. 5 Tables, 29 References. Adapted from the source document.

Empowering Female Sex Workers for AIDS Prevention and Far Beyond: Sonagachi Shows the Way

Author: Nag, Moni11 Dept Anthropology, Columbia U, New York

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61432033?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper describes the process by which the STD/HIV Intervention Programme (popularly known as Sonagachi Project) among female sex workers (FSWs) in a red light area of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) became a catalyst for the formation of an association of sex workers called Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC) & how the DMSC, in turn, has become a powerful tool for not only the epidemiological success of the Sonagachi Project, but also a vehicle for the poor & powerless FSWs to gain some control over their own lives & environment. The training & recruitment of a few selected FSWs as Peer Educators of the Project at its beginning was the first important step. The novel experience of working together with the Project physicians & college-graduate women supervisors for the welfare of community FSWs gave the Peer Educators a new sense of pride & self-confidence. They became increasingly convinced that to protect their health & fight against the injustices they suffered from, FSWs had to mobilize themselves & demand their legitimate rights through an association of their own. With the guidance & help from some dedicated Project staff, the Peer Educators took the initiative to form DMSC in 1995. The multifarious activities of the DMSC & of a few other bodies generated by it are described. These activities & their consequences demonstrate that active participation of sex workers in all aspects of a HIV/AIDS intervention project among them as well as their united struggle for the power to protect their health & basic human rights is essential for the projects success & also contributes toward an overall betterment of their life. 20 References.

New Agricultural Technology: A Gender Analysis

Author: Sundari, S1; Gowri, V1 Mother Teresa Women's U, Kodaikanal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61515454?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, an attempt is made to assess the impact of the new agricultural technology (NAT) on rural male & female workers in terms of employment, wages, & living conditions in Thiruvaiyaru taluka of Thanjavur district in the state of Tamil Nadu. Based on a sample survey, the study reveals that NAT in paddy cultivation has increased the time spent on different activities & has also generated additional employment for both sexes per season. The NAT has doubled the return on investment on farm, through an increase in the yield per acre. Despite the increase in productivity per acre, cropping pattern is undergoing a change with area under paddy cultivation declining. Money wages have increased, but there is no increase in the real wages of the workers. About 25%-35% of the families bear the brunt of poverty & the incidence of poverty is higher among the landless labor households. To reduce overcrowding of women into agriculture as laborers, women need access to inputs such as education, training, credit, & other agents of growth & change. 11 Tables, 15 References.

Abstract: All the respondents in this study, female farm laborers, were seasonal workers & did rice transplanting, wheat harvesting, hoeing & sorting out of farm produce, ie, potato picking & vegetable picking on daily wages. They were illiterate & were paid lesser wages than their male counterparts. Most of them were young & belonged to the Rai Sikhs, Baziger, Sansi, & other mixed castes. All the respondents, who had small children, brought them to the work site. Most of them cooked their day's meals before going to the work site. The main problem faced by them was weakness, followed by back pain, early onset of fatigue, & poor diet, which made their 'jobs' difficult to accomplish. Small children, no outside help, inefficient fuel, poor housing, lack of proper water supply, electricity, & lack of required household utensils & other items, were also major constraints. 6 Tables, 10 References.

The Causes of Marital Breakdown among the Diaspora of Muslims of Indian Origin

Author: Stears, Louw-Haardt1; Khan, Sultan1 Dept Sociology, U Durban-Westville, South Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61548008?accountid=14925

Abstract: The assumption that the institution of marriage is a universal phenomenon suggests that the causes leading to its breakdown are likely to be similar. Despite this similarity, the factors leading to marital breakdown are many, involving a complex interaction of sociological processes leading to disturbed marital relationships. When this happens, the potential for marital breakdown increases. This study suggests that the causes of marital breakdown among a select group of minority South African Indian Muslims in the Durban Metropolitan Area (DMA), is no different than that experienced by married couples elsewhere in the world. The attitudes of 80 respondents toward the causes of marital breakdown are measured using the Likert Scale, & analyzed against the independent variables of age, gender, education, occupation, & income. 1 Table, 49 References.

Rehabilitated Bonded Labourers in Rural Karnataka

Author: Mutharayappa, R11 Instit Economic & Social Change, Bangalore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61540743?accountid=14925

Abstract: The main focus of this study was to examine the nature of bondage of identified & released laborers & whether the rehabilitation had resulted in any increase in their income & improvements in their living conditions. To highlight these dimensions, 387 rehabilitated bonded laborers were interviewed in four districts of Karnataka state. The study finds that most of the ex-bonded laborers had worked with landlords on an annual contract, & all the respondents had received rehabilitation assets from the government. However, nearly 2% of the rehabilitated laborers had relapsed into further bondage because of their poor economic conditions. Though the rehabilitation scheme has improved their living condition, the majority have low incomes & are living below the poverty line. Even today, the major source of income is wage only. Most of them had taken loans either from the banks, cooperative societies, or private sources. The reasons for their indebtedness included expenditures related to marriage, medical treatment, & consumption. 15 Tables, 2 References. Adapted from the source document.

Disaster and Mental Health: Psychosocial Interventions

Author: Murthy, R Srinivasa1; Karki, Manju1 National Instit Mental Health & Neuro Sciences, Bangalore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61530548?accountid=14925

Abstract: Worldwide, there is increasing scientific evidence to support the importance of psychosocial interventions on the mental health of disaster victims. The objective of this article is to provide an international perspective on post-disaster mental health & the progress achieved thus far with a special focus on India. The article briefly presents new evidence on the magnitude of mental health following different disasters. It then takes into account an emerging understanding of the biological mechanisms that contribute to mental distress. One such remarkable understanding has been the association between psychosocial factors (life events, life style choices, availability of help in the occurrence) & posttraumatic stress disorder. The main section of the article analyzes different psychosocial interventions that have been used to meet the mental health needs of the population & their effectiveness. The article concludes with the discussion on the relevance of such interventions in the context of India, its implications at different levels, & future recommendations. 19 References.

Abstract: Community violence has a significant effect on children & adolescents. Early exposure to violence is not without its consequences, which may be wide-ranging from immediate physical loss to emotional & mental trauma. A study was conducted using a specially designed questionnaire that was administered to third & fourth standard students from two municipal schools in a riot-hit area. The results obtained showed high prevalence of distress symptoms among the study group. 2 Boxes, 30 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The article presents a summary analysis of the secondary psychosocial stressors & impact in the four-year aftermath of the Marathwada Earthquake Rehabilitation Project. The analysis reflects upon the day-to-day relations & experiences with villagers from the 52 core affected villages from 1993-1997. This paper traces the relationship between the change in psychological perspective, brought from the actual impact of the earthquake, & the ongoing relief & rehabilitation process. It focuses particularly on the impact of the 'rehabilitation package' & identifies eight key stages/milestones of the rehabilitation process & analyzes the specific psychosocial consequences & impact of each stage.

Skimming through the Socioeconomic Losses from an Earthquake: A Case Study from Kachchh

Author: Parikh, Alka11 Unit Rural Studies, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61549506?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article stresses on the prime importance of economic rehabilitation in any rehabilitation process after a disaster. While a food-for-work program should start almost immediately after the relief distributions begin as a method of economic rehabilitation, supporting local economic activities is the best form of rehabilitation. An attempt is made to list some of the economic losses to the families & some social costs to the community. The article also shows how the government tried to come out with policies to help in each of these losses, & observes that the benefits did not always reach the victims. 8 References.

Towards Rebuilding a Post-Disaster Society: A Case Study of Supercyclone-Affected Coastal Orissa

Author: Pareeda, Pradeep Kumar11 Mody Instit Education & Research, Sikar, Rajasthan

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61548523?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article demonstrates the overwhelming significance of societal conditions & the distribution of damage in the supercyclone-affected coastal Orissa. To understand what happens to a community in disaster, it is necessary to know what happens to families in a disaster situation. Therefore, the article has examined the family conditions that directed the continuity of social life after the catastrophe. Socioeconomic, health, cultural, & psychological factors related to rehabilitation have been given special attention. The study is based on a post-disaster society, which broadly means the rehabilitation & reconstruction process. Rehabilitation does not mean only rebuilding or repairing houses & roads, but giving utmost importance to the region if it is disaster-prone. Thus, it is more than restoring basic infrastructure. The article concludes with a brief on how sociological knowledge should advance in the broad boundaries of disaster research. 5 Tables, 1 Figure, 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

Problem and Coping Mechanisms of Lambani Female Heads of Family

Author: Kinnal, Anuradha M1; Saroja, K1 Dept Human Development, Rural Home Science Coll, U Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61431927?accountid=14925

Abstract: Lambani female heads, being born in disadvantaged families, face problems in their childhood. These problems were found to be repeated in the lives of their children. Case studies conducted with a life span perspective revealed that unless there was intervention to break this circle of poverty, it not only continued, but it was also likely to increase in the present context of inflation, unemployment, & depletion of natural resources.

Genetic Counselling: Answer to Thalassaemia and Other Genetic Disorders in the Next Millennium

Author: Ghosh, S K; Sinha, Debotosh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61503846?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over four million people with major congenital disorders, including hundreds of thousands suffering from thalassaemia, are born every year all over the world. The problem is increasing every day & becoming a threat to human existence. It is time to explore ways & means to tackle the problem. Medical treatment is very expensive for thalassaemia & other genetic dysfunctions. Prevention is the ultimate answer & genetic counseling is an answer for the prevention of genetic disorders. This article is an attempt to gloss over the concept of genetic counseling along with an introductory note on thalassaemia. Contemporary relevance of the article in social work, advances in reproductive technology & its relation to genetic counseling, the threat of HIV/AIDS that thalassaemia patients face, whether genetic counseling is to be regulated, & probable genetic services are also some of the concomitant issues briefly highlighted. 1 Figure, 18 References. Adapted from the source document.

What Does Demographic Transition Mean to a Population?

Author: Karkal, Malini

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61523375?accountid=14925

Abstract: Demographers swear by demographic transition -- balancing of birth & death rates -- as a solution to all population problems. The state of Kerala was the first one to experience demographic transition. The paper presents the employment, education, marriage, health, & economic situation in Kerala to see if the problems of the Keralites are really solved. The state has low population of people living below the poverty line, but remittances from the family members who have migrated to the Gulf & other parts of India are known to be substantial. 8 Tables, 7 References.

Author: Chauhan, Ravinder11 Government Coll Women, Shimla, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61485976?accountid=14925

Abstract: Is the joint family breaking down & undergoing a process of "nuclearization"? Forces of change have been felt in various social institutions like caste, religion, marriage, & family due to several factors. Education is considered to be the most powerful agent of change, thereby helping people form a fresh outlook toward their environment. Keeping in mind the fact that education is a powerful tool of change, a study was conducted to assess the attitudes of youths towards the joint family system. The article presents the findings of this study. 3 Tables, 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Impact of Liberalisation on Women's Health in the Marine Food Export Processing Industry

Author: Rani, S Vanaja11 Dept Sociology, Andhra U, Visakhapatnam, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61486004?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over the last two decades, the employment of women in various nontraditional, export-oriented industries like the marine food export processing industry, has been widespread in the coastal areas of India. It is a lucrative industry where the profit margin is very high. However, the processing workers (who are all women) in these plants work under very unsatisfactory conditions. They stand for more than 12 hours a day & withstand low temperatures without any protective equipment. This paper highlights how employment conditions in this industry have resulted in the poor health of women. 5 Tables, 1 Appendix, 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Chinese Counseling Method: Ways to Indigenization

Author: Lee, Wai-Man

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61497689?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper discusses possible ways to develop indigenous counseling theories & techniques that are based on the philosophies & knowledge of Chinese traditional counseling practices. Indigenous theories & techniques should have their own knowledge substance, terminology, & language to describe & understand Chinese behaviors, which are very different from those described in the Western counseling theories. To begin with, this paper will give a brief overview of the rationale for developing indigenous counseling theories & techniques. There is a strong psychosocial component in accord with Chinese philosophies about human & nature in the majority of Chinese classical canons. This psychosocial component has a solid scientific ideology & has voluminous empirical evidence. Based on these materials, this paper suggests that it is possible to develop indigenous counseling approaches that are in accordance with the Chinese worldview & cultural practices. All the new indigenous theories, counseling processes, & specific interventions should reflect the foundation of Chinese thought. They are the fundamental platform on which indigenous counseling approaches are built. 65 References. Adapted from the source document.

Parent Education Programmes in Hong Kong: Are They Effective?

Author: Cheung, Siu-Kau11 Division Social Studies, City U Hong Kong, Kowloon s.k.cheung@cityu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61537445?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study examined whether participants of parent education programs in Hong Kong experienced gains in parental efficacy, parental empathy, availability of social support, & parenting satisfaction as a result of program attendance. A single-group pre- & postprogram design was adopted. Data from 130 mother participants showed that they had positive gains in the four dimensions. However, mothers aged 40 & above & those with more than one child did not experience higher parenting satisfaction after the program. Results also indicated that among the three instrumental variables, social support was the most crucial determinant of parenting satisfaction. Implications for social work practice were discussed. 4 Tables, 23 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Double Whammy Revisited: The Impact of Exposure to Domestic Violence and Being a Victim of Parent to Child Violence

Author: Silverman, Amy1; Gelles, Richard J1 Hennepin County Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429201?accountid=14925

Abstract: The current study tests the hypothesis that children who both experience & are exposed to domestic violence suffer from a "double whammy" in terms of significant detrimental impacts. The hypothesis is tested by a secondary analysis of data collected for the Second National Family Violence Survey in the US. There was no general support for the "double whammy" hypothesis, though girls, ages 12-17, who were exposed to & experienced violence did experience more behavioral problems. 6 Tables, 35 References.

Maternal Employment and Child Abuse

Author: Prasad, B Devi11 Dept Social Work, Andhra U, Visakhapatnam, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61482904?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study, comprising a sample of 133 dual- & 136 single-earner couples, aims at exploring the relationship between mother's employment & violence toward children. The data strongly indicate that nonworking mothers report higher rates of violence. As for working parents, work stress & income are found to be indirectly related to child abuse. Family life education programs & opportunities for learning alternative, nonpunitive ways of managing interpersonal conflict are suggested, among others, to help reduce violence in families. 7 Tables, 1 Appendix, 22 References.

Community Based Initiatives in the Struggle against Domestic Violence

Author: Mitra, Nishi11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470008?accountid=14925

Abstract: Though the family is the main site of violence against women, the community plays a critical role in reinforcing unequal structures & processes in the family. This paper comments on the scope of interventions of the community-based groups & the ideological perspective within which the issue is being addressed by them in India so as to understand how far they have come in addressing feminist goals of reducing violence by men & destabilizing patriarchal power structures. 6 References.

Journey from Violence to Crime: A Research Study on Domestic Violence

Author: Dave, Anjali1; Solanki, Gopika; Basu, Pekham1 Dept Family & Child Welfare, Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429218?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper is essentially a summary of an earlier study by the authors (1999) on the Special Cell for Women & Children, a field action project of the Tata Instit of Social Sciences in Mumbai, India. The paper introduces the causation of violence as outlined by the Vienna Summit (UN, 1991). It then enumerates the objectives of the research study, sources of data, issues in data collection, & limitations of the data. Analysis of the Special Cell records permits a profile of the woman approaching the Cell for redressal of their grievances. The noncognizable offenses data is also looked into along with the findings of some other research studies in the area of domestic violence. The language used by women to voice their pain & trauma & how it is interpreted by the police are also discussed. The metaphor of a journey is used, beginning with the violated women approaching the Special Cell to report the violence experienced by her & ending with, ultimately, which voice is recognized & recorded by the police. 3 Tables, 4 References. Adapted from the source document.

Elder Abuse: Global Response and Indian Initiatives

Author: Prakash, Indira Jai11 Dept Psychology, Adult & Population Research Centre, Bangalore U, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470020?accountid=14925

Abstract: Described as "granny bashing" in the UK & "parent battering" in the US, elder abuse is yet to be clearly conceptualized in India. The prevalence rate of maltreatment of elders ranges from 4% to 10% of older people surveyed in the West. In India, neglect of the elderly is assumed to be much more prevalent than active abuse. Global response to elder abuse has been in terms of legislative measures, creating public awareness as well as intervention with victims & abusers. In India, recently, some initiatives have been taken to identify this problem, assess its prevalence, & attend to the issue of intervention & prevention. 51 References.

Elder Abuse in the Urban Context

Author: Veedon, Rosamma11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61482948?accountid=14925

Abstract: Elder abuse is a phenomenon that families are finding difficult to handle on their own. This paper is based on analysis of 200+ calls that came to a leading newspaper office in Mumbai, India, over a 2-week period in response to a request by a nongovernmental organization for information about elder abuse. The cases recorded were related to issues connected to one's residence, financial vulnerability, environmental stress, dysfunctional parent-child relationships, misuse of power, cycle of violence, & violation of rights. Efforts required by the individual, the community, & the government to reduce elder abuse are suggested. A training program to develop skills for working in situations of elder abuse is also recommended. 1 Reference. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Wolf, David B11 Florida State U, Tallahassee

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467151?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined effects of the maha mantra. The dependent variables included some mental health indicators, namely, verbal aggressiveness, spirituality, life satisfaction, stress, depression, well-being, sattva, rajas, & tamas. Five subjects were measured during a one-week baseline & a four-week intervention-chanting phase. Results were in the direction predicted by Vedic theory. These findings suggest potential for the use of the maha mantra in social work practice in areas such as stress reduction & treatment for depression. 1 Table, 32 References.

Abstract: This paper, on the basis of the Vedas & other writings, refutes the views that the four Varnas are hierarchical, the institution is divine, & the Varna-Vyavastha still functions. The study tries to explain how the Varna-Vyavasha died gradually & was replaced by Jati-Vayavastha. 7 References. Adapted from the source document.

Understanding Youth Sexuality: A Study of College Students in Mumbai City

Author: Abraham, Leena11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61525307?accountid=14925

Abstract: Students (N = 625 boys & 341 girls, lower-income, ages 16-22) at four Mumbai colleges were surveyed on their construction of sexuality; attitudes toward premarital sexuality; contexts influencing sexual activity; & sexual behaviors surrounding unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, & human immune deficiency virus. Qualitative data were gathered via observation, focus groups, & interviews to identify general views & trends. Analysis of the qualitative & quantitative data showed that boys were much more sexually knowledgeable, sexually active, & sexually liberal than girls, & had more access to sexual knowledge. In comparison to educators' views that sex education would increase promiscuity, the relationship between knowledge & behavior was not significant. Many myths & misconceptions about sex were found in both sexes, showing that the sex education programs have failed to reach this population. Recommendations for sex education programs are addressed.

What Support by Kin to Widows?

Author: Aruna, C1; Reddy, T Chandramohan1 c/o Reddy -- Dept Sociology, Bharathia U, Coimbatore

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61463072?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper portrays the type of support received by widows in rebuilding their lives through interpersonal relationships & is viewed through the emerging network perspective. It examines the inflow of support form different sources, both kin as well as non-kin. The results show that the network is small, kin-centered, physically proximate & homogeneous in gender & caste. While members of primary kin & friends of the same gender are active in extending emotional support, parents & siblings are the usual supporters in financial domain. Proximate & frequently met ties, irrespective of sectors, dominate services & informational domain. 7 Tables, 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

Problems of Female Agricultural Labourers in Male and Female Headed Families

Author: Meti, Rajeshwari D1; Krishnaswamy, Saroja; Bhat, A.R.S.1 Dept Human Development, Rural Home Science Coll

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61463276?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study aims at examining the effect of female headedness on the problems faced by the families of female agricultural laborers, who constituted the poorest among the poor sections in rural areas. The results revealed no significant difference in health problems as all respondents reported to be suffering from ill health. Even though all respondents were found to face insufficiency of food, the female heads were found to face less number of such problems. This was because their family size was small, their children were sent to wage work instead of school & there were few adult dependents in the family. These results imply that in female-headed households, many children were working for wages & deprived of education. Thus, continuing the vicious circle of poverty, arising out of illiteracy to the next generation, female heads were found to be facing significantly more problems than the respondents from the male-headed families, in child care, wage work & during off season/drought. Suggestions are given to reduce these problems of female-headed households. 8 Tables, 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

Indian Women's Experience of Household Labour: Oppression or Personal Fulfillment

Author: Verma, Suman1; Larson, Reed W1 Dept Child Development, Government Home Science Coll, Chandigarh, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61467006?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the time spent by urban middle-class women in household work with accompanying subjective states. Participants carried beeper watches for one week & reported their time spent in different activities with their subjective states, when signaled at random times. The findings reveal that women spend much more time doing household labor than their husbands, but they experience choice over these activities & do not experience them as aversive. Women often report feeling hurried, but do not feel less in control. Their emotional states neither suggest a high rate of distress, nor a high feeling of self-fulfillment while doing family work. 3 Tables, 34 References. Adapted from the source document.

Domestic and Commercial Solid Waste Management

Author: Sundari, S1; Saradha, K K1 Dept Economics, Mother Teresa Women's U, Kodaikanal

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61415819?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the nature, quantity, & method of disposal of domestic & commercial solid waste in the Gobichettipalayam block of Erode district in Tamil Nadu. Based on a sample survey, the study reveals that, in urban areas, there is a large-scale generation of domestic solid waste, as compared to the rural areas. The quantum of solid waste released is directly related to the level of household income, family size, & level of education. On account of poor disposal methods, health problems are more severe in urban, than in rural areas. With regard to commercial waste, it is inferred that industries release large quantities of solid waste, in comparison to other types of activities. The present modes of disposal by the hospitals, hotels, & markets are not safe & satisfactory. The disposal activities of Gobi Municipality lags far behind the total quantity of wastes generated, leaving about 2,322 tons of garbage unattended to every year. Therefore, effective & efficient solid waste management is of paramount importance for the maintenance of health, environmental protection, & natural resource management. 3 Tables, 3 Figures, 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

Gender Violence, Trauma, and Its Impact on Women's Mental Health

Author: Purewal, Jasjit1; Ganesh, Indira1 Interventions for Support, Healing, & Awareness, New Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61504287?accountid=14925

Abstract: Psychological trauma arising from gender violence is a significant life situation in Indian women's lives. This dimension of trauma has rarely been studied through mental health research, & remains within the ambit of law reform & enforcement, & prevention. A statistical correlation between trauma & mental illness has not been achieved yet, but a close relationship is extrapolated from significantly high rates of violence & mental illness in specific cases, as the recent study by Interventions For Support Healing & Awareness (1994) has shown. The perceptions & practice of mainstream mental health professionals about gender violence fails to recognize the psychological trauma women are exposed to. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is a useful diagnosis to be used in the measurement, assessment, & management of trauma from gender violence. It is rarely used in cases of sexual & physical violence. 9 References. Adapted from the source document.

Double Victims of Latur Earthquake

Author: Acharya, Niru11 Acharya Marathe Degree Coll, Mumbai, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496522?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper deals with the invisibility of gender dimension in the relief & rehabilitation process. It highlights the way an unthoughtful rehabilitation intervention strengthens patriarchy & subjects women to physical & mental pain. Here, the focus is on the use of a pervasive medical technology, recanalization, with a plea to preserve the social fabric, but which makes women mere "tubes & wombs" instead.

Women in Disasters and Mental Health

Author: Lohokare, Madhura1; Davar, Bhargavi V1 Jawaharlal Nehru U, New Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61457995?accountid=14925

Abstract: A "disaster" is a sociological, cultural phenomenon offering much to be studied about the interpersonal as well as group negotiations happening in community life, when the "normal" social equations do not function. Understanding what happens within communities at this time is important in planning interventions, as every individual/social interest group does not always make the same response to disasters. "Disaster management" teams, who operate with a clinical model & diagnostic operators (such as posttraumatic stress disaster) will be enabled further if they address the cultural mindsets & behavioral variety that determines human mental responses to disasters. If this variety is not appreciated, disaster management will end up being reductionist & homogenizing. Against this background of what is "community" & how communities function organically during disasters, we look at gender relations during disaster times. We address the question of the specific ways in which women have dealt with disaster situations. We look at instances where there has been an extreme elevation or extreme depression of women's space. We address the issue of whether women are victims, survivors or perpetrators in the disaster situation. We emphasize that how women are located within the social matrix will determine how they will be affected by the situation. We also emphasize that from the women's point of view, a whole range of experiences (such as violence, poverty, & homelessness) are "beyond the realm of human experience" but are yet to be fully recognized by mental health professionals as "disasters.". 20 References.

Analysing Forms of Vulnerability in a Disaster

Author: Parasuraman, S1; Acharya, Niru1 World Commission on Dams, Cape Town, South Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61458278?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper attempts to highlight the plurality of vulnerability in an affected community. It aims to suggest that the needs of each affected group differ & should accordingly be addressed. The paper is divided into three sections. The first section briefly reflects on the intertwining of disasters with vulnerability & entitlement systems. The second section draws upon a case study of the earthquake in the Osmanabad & Latur districts of Maharashtra to understand the social processes underway in the aftermath & their impact on different vulnerable groups' entitlement systems, & illustrate from available data, differential vulnerability faced by different groups. The last section generates indicators of vulnerability in a disaster situation. 2 Tables, 1 Appendix, 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

Culture and the Mental Health Consequences of Trauma

Author: Patel, Vikram11 Instit Psychiatry, London & MacArthur Population Fellow, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496559?accountid=14925

Abstract: The symptoms of mental disorders are universal as they are experienced by people in all cultures & societies, though the manner in which they are conceptualized & categorized can vary considerably. The cultural influences on mental disorders are especially relevant if research findings are to be implemented in health interventions. If, for example, depression is not viewed as a psychiatric problem, how & where should interventions for depression be delivered? The article reviews the debates on the cross-cultural validity of psychiatric categories & considers its implications for the expression, concepts, & diagnoses of the mental health consequences of trauma such as depression & Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. The article presents an agenda for research, which aims to generate culturally sensitive findings on the mental health consequences of trauma. 39 References. Adapted from the source document.

Disaster and Mental Health: Responses of Mental Health Professionals

Author: Murthy, R Srinivasa11 Dept Mental Health & Substance Dependence, World Health Organisation, Geneva, Switzerland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61458018?accountid=14925

Abstract: Mental health professionals have become a part of the teams of professionals working with disaster-affected populations all over the world. There is strong evidence, based on meta-analysis, to show that disasters increase the prevalence rate of psychopathology by approximately 17%-20% on an average. The involvement of mental health professionals in disasters, in India, has been only in the last 20 years. These professionals have attempted to raise awareness of the impact of disasters on mental health of the affected populations among the general public & policymakers. They also provide direct care to the affected populations; training of primary care doctors, health workers, & volunteers; support to the initiatives of voluntary organizations; & research. Mental health professionals in India face the challenge of building services with limited available community resources. The roles of professionals are different in the different phases of the disaster. Functions include working with the media, evaluation of ongoing programs, & reporting on the findings & advocacy with administrators, voluntary organizations, & funding agencies. These efforts not only can result in services for a large number of the population who would normally not have sought help, but also increase the awareness of the importance of mental health among individuals, communities, & planners. 57 References.

Assessment of Marital Communication and Conflict Resolution: Psychometric Properties of Two Scales

Author: Cheung, Siu-Kau11 Division Social Studies, City U Hong Kong, Kowloon s.k.cheung@cityu.edu.hk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484673?accountid=14925

Abstract: Preliminary psychometric data are presented for two Chinese self-report scales that assess marital communication & conflict resolution. These scales were based on English versions but adapted to fit the local cultural context. Results showed that the 11-item Marital Communication Scale & the 8-item Chinese Ineffective Arguing Scale produced scores that were internally consistent. Their correlations with the Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale were high & significant. There was moderate evidence to support the claim that the scales distinguished between respondents with & without marital problems. 4 Tables, 27 References. Adapted from the source document.

Poverty in Yau-Tsim-Mong District: Concentration of and Solutions to Poverty in an Old Urban District

Author: Wong, Hung

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484014?accountid=14925

Abstract: A secondary analysis of data from the 1996 Population By-Census is used to explore & explain the geographical concentration of poverty in the old urban area in Hong Kong, especially in the Yau Tsim Mong District. It suggests that the poverty problem in Hong Kong is concentrated in small geographical localities in old urban areas. The characteristic of these small localities is the high ratio of households sharing quarters with other households. More elderly, unmarried male adult & new arrival residents can be found in these poor communities. Moreover, more residents are employed as service workers & construction workers. The study reports that the concentration of poverty is a result of the interaction between the supply & demand of the low-end rental market of private housing & the development & characteristics of community economics. It recommends using community development as a strategy to alleviate poverty in these localities, to prevent ghettoization of old urban areas. 9 Tables, 19 References.

A Study on Differences of High School Students' Idol Worship: Hong Kong and Mainland China

Author: Yu, Xiao Dong; Wong, Sing Wing; Cheung, Chau Kiu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61533533?accountid=14925

Abstract: The study examined how youths in Hong Kong & mainland People's Republic of China view idols in life; 763 high school students in Hong Kong, Nanjing, Changsha, & Nantong (Tibetan students) participated in the study. They were first required to nominate three most admired people in their lives & rate them based on the degrees to which these people could become their idols & models. Then, they completed a 25-item questionnaire that examined differences in manners, motives, & perceived influence of idol worship. Hong Kong students mostly nominated recreational celebrities in the entertainment & sports industries while mainland Chinese students mostly nominated ideological celebrities in politics & academics. The most admired people nominated by mainland Chinese youths were a lot more diverse than those nominated by the Hong Kong youths. Hong Kong students were more interested in romantic & sexual characteristics, while mainland Chinese students were more interested in personality & ideological characteristics of those whom they admire. The different idol worship cultures in Hong Kong & mainland China may be attributed to a strong commercialization of adolescent idol worship culture in Hong Kong & a strong ideological identification of adolescent idol worship culture in mainland China. 4 Tables, 1 Appendix, 25 References.

Author: Mok, Bong Ho; Cheung, See Fai; Cheung, Hung

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484092?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on a national survey, this paper reports the prevalence of & group/member characteristics of cancer self-help organizations in the People's Republic of China. The findings show these organizations to be categorized as one of two types: one that is totally independent, organized, & managed by members; & the other initiated & led by professionals. The emergence & development of these groups have been deeply influenced by the New Qi Gong of Guolin. The authors briefly discuss the problems & prospects of cancer self-help organizations in China. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 30 References. Adapted from the source document.

Family as Partners in Care: Perspectives from AMEND

Author: Srinivasan, Nirmala

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61663891?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses Indian families who are caregivers of family members affected by mental illness, eg, schizophrenia & other psychiatric disorders. The analysis draws on the experience of the Assoc for Mentally Disabled (AMEND) in Bangalore, a self-help group comprising about 55 families. The practical aspects involved in the caregiving role of Indian families are discussed, suggesting that AMEND offers a unique model to family support groups across the world. The discussion on barriers & gateways to the partnership role of family provides an insight into the cultural dynamics of care in a country like India. 5 References.

Mental Disorders in India: An Analysis of Epidemiological Studies

Author: Ganguli, H C11 Dept Psychology, U Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61661498?accountid=14925

Abstract: Analyzes 15 epidemiological studies on psychiatric morbidity in India & presents prevalence rates for all mental disorders & five specific disorders for all-India & six regions. The national prevalence rates for "all mental disorders" arrived at are: 70.5 (rural), 73 (urban), & 73 (rural & urban) per 1,000 population. Prevalence of schizophrenia, which seems to be the only disorder whose prevalence is consistent across cultures & over time, is 2.5%. Among the Indian states, Uttar Pradesh has the lowest total morbidity & West Bengal has the highest. Urban morbidity in India is 3.5% higher than the rural rate, but these differences are not consistent for different disease categories. Also, unexpected rural-urban differences may be found due to factors such as social networking among city dwellers on the basis of caste, language, & village of origin linkage. In Hindi-speaking north India, mental morbidity among factory workers is 2.5 times that of nonindustrial urban inhabitants & 5 times the rural morbidity. Four large high-risk groups are identified: housewives, the unemployed, the elderly, & rank-&-file factory workers. Suggestions for improving epidemiological studies in India are offered, & attention is drawn to the need for testing socially useful hypotheses. 6 Tables, 48 References.

Family and the Emergence of Deviant Behavior among Children and Adolescents

Author: Dassi, Archana1; Khan, M Z1 Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61669387?accountid=14925

Abstract: Focuses on a shanty colony in the metropolis of Delhi, India to explore the dynamics of social deviance & social tolerance, using interview data from randomly sampled children & adolescents (N = 100) & their parents (N = 100). Their socioeconomic background is typical of slum dwellers: low education, unsettled occupation, & low income. Interestingly enough, parents' reaction to juvenile antisocial & predelinquent behavior is strong, but it is indifferent insofar as delinquent behavior is concerned. Apparently social milieu & lifestyle in slum neighborhoods is relatively more tolerant of delinquent behavior. It is concluded that parents need to be sensitized on these issues. 2 Tables, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

Water Crisis in a SAT Region and Proposed Strategies

Author: Narawade, Shahaji1; Herlekar, Manish1 TISS Rural Campus, Tuljapur, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61669774?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that the development of any area should be through a balanced utilization of available local natural resources. The ever-increasing water crisis that has resulted from prevailing water utilization & cropping patterns is traced, using an example from the Tuljapur Taluka of Ma-harashtra, a drought-prone block in a semi-arid tropical (SAT) region in India. A strategy for eradication of drought is put forth. 7 Tables. Adapted from the source document.

Timing of Marriage and Fertility in Kerala: A Cohort Analysis

Author: Sivakumar, M N11 Dept Population Studies, Bharathiar U, Coimbatore, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61654534?accountid=14925

Abstract: The marriage & fertility histories of 941 women of reproductive age from the Alapuzha district of Kerala are drawn on to examine whether the timing of marriage & fertility have changed over time among ever-married Indian women with respect to their background characteristics, namely, religion, education, place of residence, & working status. The findings show that there is a rising trend in the age at marriage of women, but a declining trend in fertility. Both Hindu & Christian women have higher age at marriage & lower fertility than do Muslim women over the birth cohorts. There is a positive relationship between age at marriage & educational attainment, but a negative relationship between fertility level & educational attainment. Working & rural women have slightly higher age at marriage & lower fertility than do their nonworking & urban counterparts in all birth cohorts, though the difference is only marginal. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Interview & focus group data from 749 respondents (Rs) in Khurda district, Orissa, India, are drawn on to examine the perceptions & interactions of various segments of the community regarding services provided by government health centers. It was found that the visits of health workers to the villages were infrequent, & their services were not satisfactory for many of the Rs. Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribe Rs reported discrimination for services at the household level. The majority were not satisfied with the services & reported many drawbacks at health centers. The need for reorientation of the health care delivery system to make it more responsive to the felt needs of the community is discussed. 1 Table, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

Predictors of Attitudes to Persons with AIDS among Young Adults in India

Author: Melkote, Srinivas R1; Goswami, Divakar1 Dept Telecommunications, Bowling Green State U, OH

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61623364?accountid=14925

Abstract: At the turn of the 21st century, India was estimated to have about 5 million HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-infected cases, more than anywhere else in the world. The AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) pandemic presents a challenge for educators, mass media communicators, & social workers. The absence of pharmacological, immunological, & medical interventions puts the spotlight on social & behavioral intervention strategies such as health communication campaigns, though their success is posited to be dependent on the attitudes of the general population toward HIV/AIDS-infected persons. Here, questionnaire data are drawn on to identify predictors of attitudes toward persons with AIDS among young adults (N = 203 students at the U of Hyderabad). Multiple regression analysis reveals that higher scores on knowledge of AIDS transmission through external contact, more positive attitude toward AIDS & safe sex, & higher parental income had a direct (positive) influence on persons with AIDS. Implications for media-based intervention strategies are discussed. 3 Tables, 31 References. Adapted from the source document.soatt

Selection of Favorite Idols and Models among Chinese High School Students: A Comparative Study in Hong Kong and Changsha

Author: Yue, Xiao Dong; Yan, Suet Lai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61446272?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study asked 258 high school students in Hong Kong & Changsha, People's Republic of China, to nominate three most admired people in their lives & rate them on the degrees to which they could become their idols & models. Hong Kong students mostly nominated celebrities in the entertainment & sports industries, while Changsha students mostly nominated celebrities in politics. Hong Kong students were more inclined than Changsha students to nominate family members, friends, & teachers to be their most admired people. A clear distinction was also noted between idols & models. Based on these results, the authors argue that "tri-star idol worship" constitutes the mainstream of idol worship for young people & that a distinction can be made between remote intimacy & immediate intimacy in understanding adolescent idol worship. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 22 References.

A Description of the Career Path of a "Street Kid" in Hong Kong and Its Implications for Labor Laws, the Education System and Social Service Provision

Author: Newbery, Peter11 Youth Outreach, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong newbery@asiaonline.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61495970?accountid=14925

Abstract: A review of extant research on marginal & delinquent youths in Hong Kong is used to describe a typical career path for marginal youths. They tend to pass through five stages, from casually running away at age 10 to serving a second prison term at age 18. Age 14 is an important turning point at which young people make crucial decisions that either take them out of this path or fix them more firmly in it. The fact that 14 is a critical age has implications for labor laws, the educational system, & the provision of social services. It is suggested that these findings make it possible to identify the target group & prescribe interventions. 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Raising the Age of Criminal Responsibility: Protection or Harm?

Author: Lo, Tit Wing

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61483982?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Hong Kong, the age of criminal responsibility is age 7, one of the lowest in the world. Recently, the Law Reform Commission recommended raising the age to 10; the Committee on Children's Rights even suggested raising it to 14. If the age of criminal responsibility is to be raised, juvenile offenders would no longer be cautioned by the police or prosecuted in the juvenile court, although care or a protection order can be granted to them. This article outlines the major factors affecting juvenile crimes & the current methods in handling juvenile offenders. It also identifies several crucial factors for consideration, in particular, the negative effect of using care or protection orders when no substantial improvement in the juvenile justice system has been made, if the age of criminal responsibility is to be raised. Several recommendations to improve the juvenile justice system are highlighted. 1 Table, 22 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Banakar, Bharathi R1; Saroja, K; Rao, Meera; Swamy, Sundara1 All India Coordinated Research Project, Dept Foods & Nutrition

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61641720?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines the front page coverage of women's issues in regional (Karnataka) & national newspapers in India in late 1995, quantifying the data in terms of amount of space, kinds of issues, & number of items. Out of 600 front pages, the newspapers published, on an average, only 12.5 items on women's issues. This speaks volumes about the indifference toward women's issues & the invisibility of women in the newspaper media. Steps to remedy the situation are indicated. 4 Tables, 10 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Khader, Vijaya11 Post Graduate & Research Center, Coll Home Science, Rajendrangar, Hyderabad, India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61652311?accountid=14925

Abstract: Empirical data collected on 120 families from four villages of Rajendranagar Mandal, Ranga Reddy district, Andhra Pradesh, India, are examined to explore the impact of women's supplementary income on family food & nutrient intake & nutritional status. Results show that expenditure on all food items except cereals & millets was significantly higher in the experimental group (women having supplementary income) than the control group, indicating the input of women's supplementary income. No significant between-group difference was observed in nutritional awareness. Children of the experimental groups were found to be in better nutritional status than children of the control group. 8 Tables, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Kumar, Promod

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61670725?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines the relationship of gender difference & marital duration with sexual anxiety via scale data from 200 married people, ages 25-45, in Gujarat, India. A 2 x 2 factorial design with two levels of gender difference (male/female) & two levels of marital duration (+/- 10 years) is used. Analysis shows that only the variable of marital duration is associated significantly with sexual anxiety. 2 Tables, 14 References. Adapted from the source document.

Limited Democracy and Welfare Ideologies: Hong Kong People's Attitudes towards Financial Assistance

Author: Chan, Chak Kwan11 School Administration & Applied Sciences Macau Polytechnic Instit

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61642542?accountid=14925

Abstract: Analyzes the relationship between democratization & Hong Kong people's welfare attitudes, based on a 1996 survey of 787 households. An "incoherent residual welfare concept" was found: on the one hand, respondents suggested higher rates of assistance for welfare recipients; but on the other hand, many strongly supported the government's residual welfare ideology. This pattern, it is argued, might be caused by limited democracy, a strong administrative-led government, & the failure of political parties to challenge the fundamental values of social welfare in a capitalist society. 5 Tables, 45 References. Adapted from the source document.

Stressors and Well-Being of Divorced Women in Hong Kong

Author: Cheung, Siu-Kau11 Division Social Studies City U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61671488?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines the prevalence of divorce-related stressors & their impact on the well-being of a cross-sectional sample of 237 separated women in Hong Kong. Interview responses reveal that most had difficulty engaging in divorce litigation, anticipated housing problems, & experienced declines in income. Regression analysis shows that litigation & housing problems are the strongest predictors among the various stressors of mental health problems. 4 Tables, 39 References.

Reflection and the Gap between Practice, Education and Research in Nursing

Author: Stark, Sheila1; Stronach, Ian; Cooke, Peggy1 Dept Health Care Studies, Manchester Metropolitan U, Elizabeth Gaskell Site, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61675063?accountid=14925

Abstract: Turbulence naturally results where there are tensions & disjunctions between educational theory & research, on the one hand, & practical application & outcomes, on the other. Explored here is how these tensions, commonly referred to as theory/practice gaps, manifest themselves in nursing practice, education, & research. To smooth the turbulence, reflection is commonly suggested as a solution. It is argued, however, that reflection may only provide, at best, a consolation in times of rapid & disturbing change & cannot spirit away the gap. If the politics of the nursing context are not acknowledged, ultimately, frustration & cynicism among professionals may result, as they find they cannot achieve the ideals that reflective practice promises to bring. 50 References.

Developing a Culturally Sensitive Approach to Promoting Heart Disease Prevention among UK Asians: An Action Research Approach Utilising Reflective Practice

Author: Verma, Chaman11 Fife SIP, Kirkcaldy Community Resource Centre, UK

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61648702?accountid=14925

Abstract: Presents a case study of how a health promotion specialist used the action research model, grounded in reflective practice, to tackle deaths from coronary heart disease among Asian communities in the UK. He was keen to use the national "Look after Yourself" (LAY) program, but felt that this initiative lacked cultural sensitivity to the needs of the Asian community. He therefore used reflective practice within the action research model, his experience as a health promotion specialist, & current theories & models of health promotion to adapt the national program by developing quality standards or guiding principles. The quality of the revised LAY intervention program continued to improve & better meet the health needs of Asians, as the action research cycle was continued. The modified program benefited 102 Asian men & women by reducing the risk of their developing heart disease. It is argued that practitioners from other disciplines could use a similar approach when there is some uncertainty about meeting the needs of clients. 1 Figure, 16 References.

Author: Ali, Mubarak11 U Sains Malaysia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61442128?accountid=14925

Abstract: Uses scale data to analyze the family's influence on the religious orientation of 276 Malay, 225 Chinese, & 249 Indian women in Malaysia. Results revealed three family-related variables -- expressiveness, conflict, & moral-religious emphasis -- as having major influences on religious orientation. Chinese respondents indicated extrinsic religious orientations, while Malays & Indians revealed intrinsic religious orientations. Implications of these observations for social work are discussed. 3 Tables, 35 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Wong, S W

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61446265?accountid=14925

Abstract: To understand the factors that lead to the onset & continuation of delinquency, a longitudinal case study, with data collected at five points of time, was launched. Nineteen outreach clients, who have exhibited some sorts of deviant behavior, were selected as research targets. The results reveal the interactive effects of social bonds, peer influence, negative labeling, & delinquent behavior. The study also identifies four different delinquent typologies based on the client's motivation & path to deviation. Based on the analysis, the investigator suggests possible solutions for helping youths at risk. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Attitudes of Chinese Elderly People towards Death: Practical Implications for Social Workers

Author: Ming-lin, Alice Chong1; Lang, Graeme S1 City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448833?accountid=14925

Abstract: Documents attitudes of some Chinese elderly people with different religious beliefs toward death & dying, drawing on interview data from 10 adults, ages 65+, in Hong Kong. Religious belief was found to have little impact on death anxiety. Chinese elderly people mainly fear the dying process & becoming an unwanted burden to caregivers. However, they are more willing to talk about & prepare for death than is generally recognized. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

Help-Seeking Patterns of Chinese Parents in Hong Kong

Author: Shek, Daniel T L11 Chinese U Hong Kong, Shatin New Territories

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448798?accountid=14925

Abstract: Help-seeking attitudes, knowledge, & behavior of 751 Chinese parents, ages 30-60, were examined via interviews conducted at the public housing estates in Hong Kong. Roughly 20% of the parents negatively viewed help-seeking, & 56.6% of them seldom sought help when needed. Most of them had weak understanding of family services, & they rarely participated in family-life education programs. Interrelationships among help-seeking attitudes, knowledge, & behavior were not strong. 2 Tables, 31 References. Adapted from the source document.

Some Findings about How AIDS Patients in Hong Kong React to Their Illness

Author: Tam, Jane11 Dept Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61528615?accountid=14925

Abstract: A total of 50 AIDS patients (including 10 expatriates) were interviewed during the period from the summer of 1993 to the end of 1996. However, interview data on the expatriates were excluded in order to focus the study on the Hong Kong context. Among the 40 local Hong Kong Chinese interviewed, 5 were female & 35 male. Their age ranged from early teens to mid-sixties, with most (85%) of them coming from the 21-40 age group. The causes of infection varied: six of them became infected due to homosexual contact, 21 due to heterosexual relationship (including the 3 women who were infected by their husbands), 5 via blood transfusion due to hemophilia/operation, & 8 were unknown. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Establishing the Building Blocks for Quality Practice Teaching in an Environment of Change

Author: Horwath, Jan1; Shardlow, Steven1 Dept of Sociological Studies, U of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, England

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61609434?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the impact of changes over the last 10 years within social work organizations & social work education in GB on practice learning & teaching. The metaphor of a house & its environment is used to explore how quality practice teaching can be assured within organizations subject to continual change. The metaphor promotes the notion that there are as many different forms of practice teaching as there are of houses. Solid practice teaching dwellings can be built even when the ground seems insecure. This metaphor also allows consideration of alternative ways in which practice learning might be constructed in the future. 33 References. Adapted from the source document.

Colonial Labour Conditions in the Plantation Industry: The Case of Criminal Tribes on the Tea Estates of Annamalai Hills

Author: Ramachandran, C1; Maya, R K1 Dept Humanities & Social Sciences Indian Instit Technology, Chennai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61515927?accountid=14925

Abstract: Analyzes the historical causes & repercussions of the Sept 1916 strike by the indigenous tea plantation workers in the Annamalai Hills of colonial India, elucidating the broader political & economic forces that shaped the spontaneous insurrection. Focus is on how the imposition of laws such as the Criminal Tribes Act of 1911 enabled the colonial state & plantation owners to recruit & control cheap labor. The development of the tea industry in the area during the turn of the century is examined to underline the changing economic situation, the growing need for tea labor, & the impacts of WWI. The Criminal Tribes Act allowed the state to designate entire ethnic groups as criminal & subject to several exploitative labor controls. 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Throws light on the status of women (at the household level) & its link with fertility, based on survey data drawn from 300 currently married women residing in a small town in Tamil Nadu, India. Cross-tabular, hierarchical, & multiple classification analyses suggest that all status dimensions of women play a crucial role in influencing their cumulative fertility (children ever born). 4 Tables, 19 References.

Abstract: Data from a survey of 409 college students collected by the government of Maharashtra (India) to assess the effectiveness of an intervention program on HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) are analyzed by comparing pre- & postintervention knowledge & attitudes. Postintervention results show that knowledge about the use of condoms in preventing HIV transmission & attitudes toward sexually transmitted diseases & homosexual behavior both need to be improved. 8 Tables, 13 References.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular disease, a common cause of death & perhaps the first cause of disability in adults in Hong Kong, takes a toll on patients & their family members, & the slow & difficult rehabilitation period can be a very disempowering experience. Here, the effectiveness of using self-help/mutual help groups as a means to overcome the powerlessness of stroke victims is assessed, based on results of a pre- & postcomparison evaluation of paired cases of 50 stroke victims, divided into participants & nonparticipants in a self-help network. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 25 References.

Evaluating a Theoretical Model of School Withdrawal Using a Qualitative Analysis

Author: Hemmings, Brian1; Putai, Jin; Low, Renae1 Dept Education Charles Stuart U, Bathurst New South Wales 2795 Australia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445763?accountid=14925

Abstract: A theoretical model of postcompulsory schooling persistence & attrition is proposed & elaborated, drawing on data obtained from longitudinal questionnaires completed by 484 students in New South Wales, Australia, supplemented by in-depth interviews with a subsample of 25 students. Results of a path analysis indicate that the validated model can be a useful tool for social workers, school counselors, & policymakers to identify potential school dropouts at critical stages & to promote discussions among students, parents, & school personnel for the development of effective intervention strategies. 1 Figure, 38 References.

Safeguarding the Rational Allocation of Public Housing Resources in Hong Kong

Author: Yu, Lau Kwok11 Dept Public & Social Administration City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61445752?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Hong Kong government's housing policy has recently introduced an asset test to supplement the income test for tenant households. Here, the ability of this policy to safeguard the rational allocation of public housing resources is explored. The objectives, value premises, principles, & strategies adopted are examined, along with the impact of the policy on housing the needy. The discussion contributes to the debate on residualization in the social-rented sector & housing affordability of public housing tenants, & addresses the issues of resource allocation & equity. 3 Tables, 53 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Status of Women in Capitalist Societies

Author: Yeung, Agnes; Yu, Kam-Wai

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484027?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 1995, the Division of Social Studies in the City U of Hong Kong interviewed 235 women in managerial positions with the aim of exploring their status & roles in the family & workplace. The findings are reported here. The main argument is that women from different social classes have different experiences in developing their careers & looking after their families. It is possible for some women to achieve a high status at work &, at the same time, enjoy a greater share of power at home in a capitalist society. However, this should not be taken as an indication that the majority of women in Hong Kong could enhance their social status solely through participation in the labor market. There are some structural factors in the capitalist system that require further exploration. 11 Tables, 8 References. Adapted from the source document.

Combating Violence against Women: Hindsight from a Decade of News Reports on Family Violence in Hong Kong

Author: Chung, Chan Yuk11 Dept Applied Social Studies, Hong Kong Polytechnic U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61484595?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper is based on a research project, "A Documentation of Newspaper Reports on Family Violence in Hong Kong in the Past Decade," carried out between 1992 & 1994. Based on a content analysis of news coverage of domestic violence in a local Chinese newspaper between 1 Jan 1981 & 31 Dec 1990, the author identified a number of findings in this study. First, it was found that 80% (N = 91) of the victims of spousal abuse were women. Second, news coverage on violence against women in conjugal relationships were skewed with reports of violence of a physical nature (94%). Third, the reports represented only the most serious cases &, therefore, only the tip of the iceberg insofar as violence against women is concerned. This is because (1) a large number of these cases involved the use of deadly weapons such as choppers & knives; (2) all cases required police intervention; & (3) 93% of nonfatal cases required immediate medical attention. Lastly, the present study found that the discourse tended to view violence against women as a private, rather than public, issue. On the basis of these findings, the paper discusses the implications for social work practice. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 22 References. Adapted from the source document.

Uncovering the Etiological Assumptions of the Response to Juvenile Delinquency in Hong Kong

Author: Wong, Dennis S.-W.11 Dept Applied Social Studies, City U Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61511216?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper highlights the profiles of juvenile crime & the responses to juvenile delinquency in Hong Kong in the last few decades. With the aid of criminological literature & policy documents, the author uncovers the underlying etiological assumptions of delinquency. The assumptions are biased in favor of the functionalist perspective. Until the publication of a recent study on the social causes of delinquency, interactionist theories seemed to have no part in explaining crime in Hong Kong. The author argues that under the dominance of the positive noninterventionist political culture in Hong Kong, academics are prone to be conservative. This paper suggests that future research should focus on testing interactional effects among the social variables derived from the social control, strain, labeling, & differential association theories. 26 References.

Revival of the Devadasi System

Author: Sahoo, B B11 Indian Statistical Instit, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61458949?accountid=14925

Abstract: Condemns the devadasi system, which recruits young girls for lifelong service in a temple, & its recent revival in southern India. Events at the Jagannath Temple at Puri, where its administration has relaxed the rules governing devadasi, are recounted. The history of the devadasi system is recalled, & changes in the recruitment & rewarding of the women who served are discussed. It is argued that this ancient practice that once provided spiritual satisfaction, respect, & a decent income has turned into a system of sexual slavery, where women are mistreated, exploited, & forced into prostitution to survive. This is linked to broader issues of gender inequality & disempowerment of women in Indian society & discriminatory practices such as dowries & purdah. The devadasi system should be declared a violation of women's human rights & eradicated through socioeconomic changes among the poor, uneducated, & untouchables; an identification & rehabilitation program is advocated. 12 References.

Human Ecological Stress and Demographic Decline: A Case of Negritos of Andamans

Author: Kailash11 Unit Urban Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Mumbai 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61533840?accountid=14925

Abstract: Links the threatened survival of the Indian Negritos of the Andaman Islands to British colonial policies. A history of British contact & the harmful effects of policies aimed at controlling & "civilizing" Negritos is presented. Policies revolved around separating the Negritos from their natural environment & imposing Western customs, foods, & religion on a people traditionally closely tied to a jungle ecosystem that supported them. The resulting demographic decline is analyzed, & population data are presented. Changes brought on after Indian independence, eg, immigration, growth of disease from heavy deforestation, & fertility & mortality effects of depopulation, are discussed. Welfare & rehabilitation efforts, beginning with the Colonization Plan of 1950, are found to be inadequate. By bringing disease, taking land, & forcing civilization, the British deprived the Negritos of their identity & livelihood, leaving a legacy that could eliminate them completely. 9 Tables, 1 Figure, 19 References.

Abstract: Explores attributions of managerial work & adult locus of control, consolidating data from three applications of the Bankers' Attribution Profile (total N = 1,244 Indians). Several action strategies in the perspective of work organizations are highlighted, showing that organizational members are required to attribute more internal (ability & effort) & less nature of task factors to the cause of their behavioral outcomes. 5 Tables, 43 References.

Author: Mishra, K N11 Regional Coll Education, Bhubaneshwar

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61448153?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores the effect of achievement motivation on anxiety & academic achievement for 183 primary school children in classes III-V in India, drawing on scale data. Children, grouped by high & low achievement motivation on the basis of median split on achievement motivation score, were matched on motivational levels. Findings showed that children with high n-ach performed better academically & possessed a significantly low level of test anxiety. However, they failed to differ in general anxiety. A disordinal interaction was observed between education & achievement motivation level on test anxiety. Further, academic achievement of class III children was negatively correlated with general test anxiety. Low achievement motivation children of class V showed significant & positive correlation between academic achievement & test anxiety. 4 Tables, 22 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Discusses the ethical & legal aspects of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) & cautions against short-sighted legal solutions to the complex issue. Legislation must play a positive role of integrating affected persons in society by protecting them from discrimination. Besides the protective role, the proactive & instrumental role of law is seen to be important in containing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. 5 References. Adapted from the source document.

Structure and Marriage Patterns among Tribals in Karnataka

Author: Mutharayappa, R11 Population Research Centre, Bangalore India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61486013?accountid=14925

Abstract: Describes the social structure & marriage patterns among the Jenu Kurubas & Kadu Kurubas of Karnataka, India, drawing on structured interviews with 1,133 women. It is found that, while Kadu Kurubas structure themselves according to divisions & clans, the Jenu Kurubas prefer to speak of gods and groups. Further, among the Kadu Kurubas, members of the community called patri-sibs help to regulate marital relations, while Jenu Kuruba young people are allowed to marry anyone except immediate blood relations. In both tribes, elders exercise very little control over brides & grooms in the marriage ceremony, as marriages are sometimes arranged by parents & at other times initated by elopement. Both consanguineous & nonconsanguineous marriages are found among both tribes. Although these two tribes live in similar ecological regions, it is found that they differ in cultural behavior. 1 Table, 2 Figures, 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Emergence of Slums: A Case Study of Thane Urban Agglomeration

Author: Nangia, Parveen1; Gupta, Kamla; Tiwari, N C1 Dept Migration & Urban Studies International Instit Population Sciences, Govandi Station Rd Deonar Bombay 400088 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61587830?accountid=14925

Abstract: Describes the prevalence of urban slums in Thane, India, & the tolerance policy of the government, drawing on a 1991-1993 survey of 176 slums. Two types of slums are depicted: (1) those that consist of settlements where living conditions are very bad because of a variety of conditions, eg, the old age of buildings, materials used to construct the buildings, & lack of basic amenities; & (2) those that function as squatter settlements in which people live in poorly made temporary huts. Proximity to main roads & workplaces & the availability of water are found to be important locational indicators. Squatters prefer to squat on government land, where eviction is less common, & many of these newer slums have been located in the forest. A typical slum is a labyrinth of haphazardly strewn, electrified, single-story huts complete with small stores & schools. The development level of a slum is generally predicted by its duration of existence, the ownership of land on which it is located, & the place of origin of the first settlers. An environmental improvement scheme is slated to provide water, plumbing, & electrical amenities. Recommendations for improving conditions are listed. 2 Tables, 7 References. Adapted from the source document.

Are Educated Unemployed Youth in India Externally Oriented?

Author: Singh, Lal Bahadur1; Singh, Arun Kumar; Singh, Arvind Kumar1 Dept Psychology T M Bhagalpur U, 812007 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61488048?accountid=14925

Abstract: Investigates the degree of internal & external orientation at macro- & microlevels in 400 educated youths in India, ages 27-32, equally divided into professional unemployed, nonprofessional unemployed, professional employed, & nonprofessional employed, drawing on scale data. Statistical comparison revealed that both professional groups & the nonprofessionally educated unemployed youth were relatively less internally oriented & more externally directed than the nonprofessional employed group. Findings indicated that all groups had a tendency to score higher on measures of external control. Implications for analyzing the impact of occupational status on psychological well-being are briefly noted. 3 Tables, 23 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Mental Hospital and Colonialism in India

Author: Mondal, Parthasarathi11 Centre Social Medicine & Community Health Jawaharlal Nehru U, New Delhi 110067 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61490525?accountid=14925

Abstract: Argues that the development of mental-health-oriented psychiatry in India is closely associated with British social control in colonial India. The spread of mental hospitals is demonstrated to be commensurate with the spread of colonialism in that country, with the establishment of the first such facility in Calcutta in 1787. Another period of growth occurred in the mid-19th century as the British sought to extend their control through eastern India. As with any product of an alien society, the mental hospital introduced a set of disciplinarian, medical, & psychiatric processes. In this way, their proliferation & function was closely associated with that of British prison facilities throughout India. In postcolonial India, these processes continue but they are more complex & insidious. It is argued that, in postcolonial India, the Western-influenced development of community psychiatry continues the practice of controlling the masses left in turmoil by the exploitative policies of the ruling class. 26 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61505241?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interview data from 105 Indian women police officers selected proportionally by regional area & job category are used to investigate problems they face in the criminal justice administration regarding tensions involved in performing a diverse set of roles connected to both traditional & nontraditional society. Ss were found to experience the least amount of role conflict when performing traditional female roles; however, they experienced much higher levels of conflict & stress in their job roles, attributed to the duties allotted to them rather than to relationships to & attitudes of their male counterparts. Most prominent areas of stress included time management, energy, & resources. The time factor is found to correlate with the traditional roles; it is a common resource to both traditional & job-related roles. 5 Tables, 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Statistical data, 1990-1994, indicate that ordinary criminal laws against child sexual abuse in India are inadequate to protect children, requiring special legislation. Secondary survey data from 348 girls reveal that sexual abuse takes many forms, eg, molestation/sexual overtures & rape. Moreover, over 40,000 children are forced into the flesh trade catering to international tourists; a 1991 case study illustrates. International legal trends are reviewed, eg, chemical castration of sex offenders in CA. At present, no such comprehensive laws or policies exist in India, with several different statutes dealing with such crimes as rape, "unnatural" sexual practices, molestation, exploitation, & indecent representation. Further, the common forms of child sexual abuses do not even fall under the legal definition of rape. A change in Indian attitudes, which presently place a premium on virginity & therefore tend to overlook the plight of sexually abused children, & vigorous advocacy of legal reform on the part of the media & nongovernmental organizations are called for. 2 Tables, 7 References.

A Look at the Illness Trajectory of AIDS Patients in Hong Kong

Author: Tam, Jane S C11 Dept Applied Social Studies Hong Kong Polytechnic U, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61542249?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interview & in-depth case study data gathered 1993/94 from 50 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients in Hong Kong are used to examine their adjustment to the illness. The concept of trajectory is used to delineate four illness phases: human immunodeficiency virus infection onset, appearance of AIDS-related complexes, full-blown situation, & dying. In each phase, findings are discussed in terms of socioeconomic, psychological, & existential disruptions. It is concluded that AIDS patients write their own unique illness trajectories. 13 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: A case study of female district board members in Hong Kong reveals that, restrained by the patriarchal ideology, these pioneers in grassroot political participation did not gain the same increase in their family status as they did in their social status. This discrepancy reflects the role played by ideology in perpetuating gender inequality; the role stereotype of women as carers is the restraining factor to their participation in society. 2 Tables, 12 References.

A Study of the Attitudes of Secondary School Students toward Marriage in Hong Kong

Author: Yeung, Caroline S T1; Kwong, Wai-man1 Dept Applied Social Studies City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61518479?accountid=14925

Abstract: Investigates secondary school students' attitudes toward marriage in Hong Kong, drawing on 1994 self-administered questionnaire data from 952 secondary school students. Findings revealed emerging trends of divorce, extramarital affairs, early dating, & premarital sex. Further, students perceived a multifaceted change occurring in the belief-value system, including declining notions of marriage as a life-long commitment & increased preferences for nonmarried cohabitation. Despite positive conceptions of parental marriages & beliefs in their own future marriages, students showed preference for later marriages with less emphasis on procreation. Though overall gender differences were evident, females proved more traditional toward social standing, yet more progressive in attitudes on egalitarian family practices & equal sexual roles. D.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61489542?accountid=14925

Abstract: Longitudinal semistructured interview data are drawn on to investigate stressful life events, social support patterns, & suicide attempt characteristics of 73 suicide attempters treated 1988-1991 in the emergency ward & at a psychiatric service of a general hospital in India. Responses were compared to those of 58 depressives at the same hospital & 60 members of the general population matched for age & sex. Specific features of the quantity & quality of social relationships leading to help & support are examined. The crucial differences between suicide attempters, depressives, & the general population are in the number of friends with whom the Ss had regular contact or fulfilled other support functions. Implications for suicide prevention planning strategies are discussed. 3 Tables, 26 References. Adapted from the source document.

Child Abuse: A Systems Analysis

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61513976?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on a survey of 167 child abuse cases in Rajasthan, India, the concept, magnitude, & types of child abuse & victims' problems are examined. In assessing the etiological factors in physical, sexual, & emotional abuse of children, examined is a model that emphasizes the interrelationship of four factors: family environment, structural stresses, parent characteristics, & subcultural learning. Two important factors in the causative analysis are described: (1) socialization practices & child development patterns that explain child abuse in terms of the degree to which a parent uses negative, inappropriate control strategies; & (2) stresses that give rise to maladaptive behavior. 24 References.

Abstract: Examines interview data on the processes of social aging of 150 residents, ages 55+, in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Delhi, India. Focused on social network & exchange theory, the results show that network size appears to be influenced by age, sex, self-reported health status, & control of household resources, but not by material lifestyle & household type. 1 Table, 4 Figures, 24 References.

Future Perspective on the Youth Policy and Programmes

Author: Hans, Gurmeet11 National Service Scheme Unit Tata Instit Social Sciences, Mumbai India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61599836?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since youths constitute as much as 33% of the population in India, its Dept of Youth Affairs & Sports has created a youth policy & a related plan of action. Here, the need for greater involvement of youth in the formulation of the policy & action plan is emphasized. Also discussed is the need for bridging gaps between researchers & planners, governmental & nongovernmental agencies, & various government departments. It is suggested that if youth involvement is to mature from mere catchy slogans, the direction will have to be explicit in policy. 1 Reference. Adapted from the source document.

Conversion of Upper Castes into Lower Castes: A Process of Asprashyeekaran (Encompassing Untouchability)

Author: Lal, Shyam11 Dept Sociology U Rajasthan, Jaipur 302004 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61487689?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the nature, underlying motivations, & implications of Asprashyeekaran (AK): the downward caste mobility of Indian groups & individuals. AK is defined as a process whereby high- or low-caste individuals or tribes accept the membership of an untouchable caste (Bhangi, Chamar, Bhalahi, Mahar, Bairwa) & thereby lower their social & ritual position. Previous caste identity is lost over 1-2 generations & the customs, beliefs, & ways of life of the untouchable caste are adopted. Four models of this process are considered: sociocultural, religion-ritual, historicopolitical, & economic. Although AK may be forced on people due to violation of caste social norms, irregular conduct, punishment for crimes, or illicit relations with a lower-caste woman, it has been deliberately sought in some instances. As a result of strict association of castes with types of employment & economic upheaval in recent decades, certain high-caste members have been exposed to poverty & have sought membership in lower castes to secure reservation benefits &/or government services. 1 Table, 39 References.

Enforcement of Mahr by Muslim Women: A Case for Reconsideration

Author: Wani, M Afzal11 Faculty Law U Kashmir, Hazratbal Srinagar 190006 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61488388?accountid=14925

Abstract: The concept of mahr, a Muslim law requiring a husband to grant a gift of property to his wife at marriage, is discussed in a review of Islamic literature & legal decisions. Although mahr is an accepted & vital symbol of female property & authority rights, it is argued that this law has been neglected & misused in recent decades. The courts have advocated three potential schemes for the payment of mahr: at the time of marriage, at the time of a specified event or duration, or gradual payment of deferred portions. Although Muslim scholars continue to debate this point, the courts have also limited women's rights, as outlined in the Koran, to seek divorce &/or refuse the company of their partner due to failed or tardy payment of mahr. Drawing on the Koran & other Muslim literature, it is argued that the courts have violated the Islamic spirit of mahr. A more functional & clearly defined institution of mahr is needed to advance the rights & status of women in Islamic nations; strategies for doing so are outlined. Adapted from the source document.

Working Status and Health: A Study of Middle-Class Calcutta Women

Author: Mukhopadhyay, Susmita11 Indian Statistical Instit, Calcutta 700035

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61490116?accountid=14925

Abstract: The relationship between working status & measures of mental & physical health was examined in a survey of approximately 200 middle-class working & nonworking mothers (WMs & NWMs) from Calcutta, India. Recent research & theory have suggested that the dual roles of worker & mother may cause identity conflict & mental & physical problems, but the present findings do not support this claim &, instead, evidence an overall similarity between WMs & NWMs. Hired help performed the majority of domestic duties for both groups. WMs did experience a statistically significantly greater frequency of nonchronic illnesses than NWMs. In terms of mental health, WMs evidenced greater mental well-being & higher scores of subjective family cohesion. It is concluded that the dual obligations of work & family life are either nonstressful for WMs, or they successfully cope with conflicting demands. 8 Tables, 12 References.

Examine the Occupational Therapy Stations in Guangzhou with Reference to the Shared Care Approach

Author: Yu, Sam Wai-kam1; Chau, Ruby Chui-man1 Division Social Studies City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61444403?accountid=14925

Abstract: Explores occupational therapy stations in Guangzhou, People's Republic of China, highlighting the shared care approach & drawing on interviews with trainers & discussions with officials in Dong Shan District. It is argued that occupational therapy stations share common points with the shared care approach in reinforcing the family as the main care provider & emphasizing community intersectoral cooperation in helping people with learning difficulties. However, they fail to reduce family caring costs & responsibilities. This is because existing relationships between participants in the caregiving process are too hierarchical to support a client-centered & user-friendly service. 9 References.

The Emerging Rural Youth: A Study of Their Changing Values towards Marriage

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61524969?accountid=14925

Abstract: Assesses the effects of modernization & urbanization in changing the attitudes of Indian youth toward marriage, which had traditionally been arranged by parents at a young age. A sample of 1,500 rural youth from 7 villages in Gulbarga District, Karnataka, were interviewed over 3 months, revealing that the attitude of male, but not female, youth toward the ideal age at marriage & arranged marriage had changed considerably. It is concluded that modernizing forces in India have not adequately reached female youth, & that there is a need for greater involvement of young women in democratic processes. 4 Tables, 9 References.

From Penal Settlement to Capital Town: Human Ecological Aspect of the Rise and Growth of Port Blair

Author: Kailash11 Unit Urban Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, Deonar Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61438080?accountid=14925

Abstract: Examines the effects of unabated population pressure from the Indian mainland on the human ecology & environment of Port Blair, the capital of the Andaman islands. At the time that Port Blair was established as a penal settlement, the region was covered by lush forests. It has now become a multicultural center of urban trade & transport, whose growth is marginalizing the native island inhabitants & threatening their remaining land. The developmental pursuits of the islands are far behind those of other parts of India, & urban facilities are deteriorating due to the heavy population pressure. It is recommended that: controls be placed on continued population growth, island administration be decentralized, & more emphasis be placed on developmental activities that rely on local resources. 2 Tables, 20 References.

A Study of Familial and Non-Familial Influences in Aggression among Adolescents

Author: Talwar, Prashant11 KMC Hospital, Mangalore India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61533535?accountid=14925

Abstract: Draws on previous research to study factors in the family & peer group that influence adolescent aggression. Interviews were conducted with 106 adolescents of Bengere Island, India, regarding their levels of latent aggression, peer relations, & family functioning, while their mothers were questioned on the functioning of their marriages. Multiple regression analysis revealed significant inverse correlations between family functioning & latent aggression & between peer group influence & aggression. It is concluded that the poorer the influences of family & peer group, the higher the level of adolescent aggression, & that family influences are stronger than peer influences. 6 Tables, 17 References.

Panchayati Raj: Challenges to Be Met

Author: Galliara, Meena11 Tata Instit Social Sciences, Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61543841?accountid=14925

Abstract: Analyzes the issues & challenges confronting the panchayat institution of India, which is a constitutionally safeguarded instrument of decentralized democratic development. Lack of regulatory powers & adequate representation has rendered many of these panchayats nonfunctional, ineffective, & subject to centralized state control. In response, the Indian government passed an amendment that further empowered the panchayats such that they would become an effective & strong people's organization. Since the panchayats pose a challenge to the established order, however, the states have followed the amendment in letter but not in spirit. It is concluded that, for the panchayats to succeed, a commitment to decentralization must be formed among government officials, & a multidisciplinary approach must be taken. 24 References.

Post-Divorce Family Environment as a Protective Factor against Depression among Children of Single-Parent Families

Author: Cheung, Siu-kau11 Division Social Studies City U Hong Kong, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61431026?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research shows that depression is a central phenomenological experience of children of divorce, & the problem is mainly attributed to parental conflict. Examined here is the significance of family cohesion as a protective factor against depression, drawing on scale data from 143 children of single-parent families in Hong Kong whose parents divorced or separated within the past 2 years. As predicted, the Ss had elevated depressive symptoms. Both family cohesion & family conflict were associated with depressive symptoms, but the former was a significantly stronger predictor. Depression was not associated with change in family economic condition. Findings highlight the importance of promoting family cohesion in addition to the prevention of family conflict in helping children cope with divorce. 4 Tables, 52 References.

The Men Speak Out over Their Extramarital Activities in China

Author: Young, Katherine P H1; Kwan, Roger W H1 Dept Social Work & Social Administration U Hong Kong, Hong Kong

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61427150?accountid=14925

Abstract: In-depth interview data from 11 Hong Kong men who engaged in extramarital activities while working in China are drawn on to describe their experiences & viewpoints. These men considered that if they just provided financially, cared for & about their wives & family, extramarital activities, while away from home, would not harm their marriage. It is suggested that the lifestyle & business culture of working in China tend to create norms & circumstances that contribute to the increasing prevalance of such extramarital involvement. Risks to marital stability associated with this lifestyle are discussed. 2 Tables, 15 References. Adapted from the source document.

Empowerment Networking Groups for Women Whose Spouses Are Having Extramarital Affairs

Author: Kwok, Paulina C Y11 Hong Kong Caritas Family Service, Tuen Mun South

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61591378?accountid=14925

Abstract: The conventional social work approach toward extramarital affairs among men in Hong Kong tends to marginalize the problem into individual weakness rather than empowerment. Inspired by feminist thinking, the problem is redefined here into one of gender inequality. The first empowerment networking group for women whose spouses are having affairs was established in Dec 1993 in a family service center. Through the collective sharing of similar experiences & causes of their emotional problems, participants became their own representatives to speak about their difficulties & concern. Their unheard voices are now attended by both political & public sectors. 11 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Ko, Grace Po-chee11 Dept Applied Social Studies City U Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61481920?accountid=14925

Abstract: Attempts to understand the stresses & coping mechanisms of infertile women in Hong Kong with reference to the Chinese culture. Interviews (N = 7) show that high levels of stress exist in terms of treatment, attitudes of medical & nursing staff, lack of money & time, & sexual relations difficulties. Dependency on advanced medical technology create major challenges; loneliness & isolation from social circles cause psychological strain. The behavioral, cognitive, & affective coping mechanisms used by these women are reported. Recommendations at both macro- & microlevels are discussed. 2 Figures, 25 References.

Abstract: Describes an urgent need for increased awareness among the people of India regarding aspects of sexual behavior that are particularly risky with regard to contracting AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome). Topics such as premarital & extramarital sex, female & male sex workers, homosexuality, & hiras (eunuchs) are discussed. High risk sexual behavior involving the above aspects are not as uncommon in India as generally assumed, according to extant empirical evidence. 2 Tables, 91 References.

Appropriate Methodologies for Studying Sexual Behaviour in India

Author: Basu, D P

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61381490?accountid=14925

Abstract: Describes research conducted to develop appropriate methodologies for studying sexual lifestyles & habits of urban Indians. Findings from 8 focus-group interviews of middle-class men & women in Bombay & Calcutta, supplemented by subsequent field research & testing, demonstrate the need for large-scale quantitative studies to map sexual behavior. It is concluded that, given an in-depth understanding of sociocultural issues unique to the Indian context, it is possible to undertake such an exercise with reasonable levels of acceptability & validity. 17 Tables, 11 References.

Author: Pelto, Pertti J

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61410219?accountid=14925

Abstract: Describes the utility of focused ethnographic study (FES), a research strategy designed to provide very specific types of data for intervention programs. The need for qualitative research in international health programs & for fairly rapid data-gathering techniques can be met by FES. Here, the application of FES to areas of health, economic development, & other programmatic concerns is described, focusing on behavioral interventions for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 10 References. Adapted from the source document.

Cultural Contexts of Sexual Behaviours and Identities and Their Impact upon HIV Prevention Models: An Overview of South Asian Men Who Have Sex with Men

Author: Khan, Shivananda

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61609575?accountid=14925

Abstract: The sexual behaviors & identities of 1,200 men of South Asian descent who engage in homosexual behavior were examined through discussions, interviews, letters, & phone calls. Ss were predominantly ages 22-35, & the vast majority were married & not identified as gay. Few of the Ss informed their wives of their encounters, & many saw sex with their wife not as a pleasure, but as a duty. Encounters with men were a sexual release & did not usually lead to emotional relationships. Fifteen % of the Ss described their first sexual encounter with a man as rape or sexual abuse. Masturbation was the most common first sex act & the first encounter was usually initiated by the partner, to whom the S was often related. Findings are viewed in relation to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) prevention, & are compared to previous research in Western populations. 2 Tables. Adapted from the source document.

Meeting the Needs of the Ageing Population in Hong Kong: Burden or Challenge?

Author: Kwan, Alex Yui-huen1; Davis, Leonard F1 Dept Applied Social Studies City Polytechnic Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61624607?accountid=14925

Abstract: Growth in the proportion of elderly in Hong Kong's population has implications for demands on public services, given that the elderly are more likely to require medical, financial, & personal support. Focus here is on how these needs are met. An emphasis on the community care approach -- support given to frail, disabled, or dependent people living in their own homes -- has effects on housing & residential provision, women in the labor force, & the quality of life of the elderly. The system of family care is not likely to remain feasible since there will be fewer family members to care for the elderly. Long-term care should offer wide-ranging support services for the elderly & their families in different areas & should be integrated with housing, nutrition, & health services. Without a commitment to community care policies, a bleak future is predicted. 10 Tables, 22 References. A. Cole

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61637294?accountid=14925

Abstract: The reproductive hazards faced by women in the chemical industries & regulatory approaches to hazard management are discussed. Infertility, subfertility, miscarriage, & birth defects can be caused by the toxic effects of single compounds or reactions between compounds. The women at greatest risk are young, less-educated, unskilled, part-time, & disabled workers, & those with multiple exposures. Measures to minimize exposure include enforced compliance with existing standards, biological & environmental monitoring, computerization of inventory, information access, proper use of health & safety personnel, medical surveillance, preemployment health screening, employee education & counseling, management initiative to handle chemicals correctly, supportive maternal leave & return policies, engineering & work practice controls, &, as a last resort, protective gear. 3 Tables, 20 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61629522?accountid=14925

Abstract: Bivariate & multiple regression analyses of survey data obtained from 100 midlevel executives in 4 medium-sized Indian organizations reveal statistically significant negative correlations between conflict & age, tenure, job involvement, work involvement, & role efficacy. Four role conflict & 3 organizational conflict variables were used. Role efficacy explained 22% of role conflict perception variance. Role efficacy combined with job involvement accounted for 47% of organizational conflict variance. 3 Tables, 67 References. Adapted from the source document.

Theoretical Controversies in Organisational Behaviour

Author: Pandey, S11 Dept Personnel Management & Industrial Relations Tata Instit Social Sciences, Deonar Bombay 400088 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387712?accountid=14925

Abstract: The debates over methodologies in organization research & the question of whether universal or culture- & nation-specific management theories should be developed are summarized. There is no evidence that any theory of how to manage is the best theory, but there is still a strong desire to seek one. Often this means the importation of Japanese or US models into countries where they may not be ideally applicable. Methodological debates (eg, idiographic vs nomothetic) & paradigm competition (eg, radical structuralism vs functionalism vs interpretivism vs radical humanism) have also muddied the field of organization theory. 44 References.

Challenges in Developing Indigenous Theories of Organisation and Management: An Indian Perspective

Author: Gupta, Rajen K11 Indian Instit Management, Lucknow 226013

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382709?accountid=14925

Abstract: The development of culture- & nation-specific theories of organizational behavior are advocated for India. Theoretical challenges include forming concepts in the context of Indian cultures & languages, understanding the complexity of Indian society, & developing comparisons with other contexts. Methodological challenges are performing grounded research, using holistic case studies, incorporating historical methods & culturally sensitive depth psychology, studying natural experiments of organizational change, & conducting action research & international research. In The Importance of the Historical Context, Udai Pareek (Indian Instit of Health Management Research, Jaipur) applauds Gupta & emphasizes the need to study India's identity formation & inherited collective unconscious. In Indigenisation of OB Research in India: A Subjective View, Jai B. P. Sinha (ANS Instit of Social Studies, Patna, India) agrees that a specifically Indian organization research (but one that integrates relevant ideas & methods from other cultures) should be developed by the collective efforts of Indian academia. In Prospects for Phenomenological Organizational Behavior, Nirmala Srinivasan argues that Gupta idealizes Indianization & downplays serious academic conflicts & rivalries that will not be easily overcome. Controversies over phenomenology & applications of grounded theories for solving behavioral problems are discussed in the context of Gupta's call. 20 References. E. Blackwell

The Future of Trade Unions

Author: Mathur, Ajeet11 Dept Personnel Management & Industrial Relations Indian Instit Management, Calcutta 700027

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374240?accountid=14925

Abstract: As evidenced by declining membership, political clout, & tactical strength, trade unions are weakening, both internationally & in India. Here, this decline is considered in the context of union history in GB, the US, Australia, the former USSR, Scandinavia, & the People's Republic of China. Due to its pursuit of a mixed economy, India developed several forms of union. This fragmentation, coupled with a shrinking base, makes collective mobilization unlikely. The future of unions in India depends on broadened objectives that seek the well-being of all working people. The democratization of unions & coalitions or mergers of unions with overlapping concerns are also advocated. Adapted from the source document.

Higher Education Teachers' Perception and Feelings about Their Community and Institutions: A Study of the Culture of Educational Institutions

Author: Kalra, Satish Kumar1; Raina, Rashmi; Gupta, Rajen K1 Indian Instit Management, Lucknow 226013

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374542?accountid=14925

Abstract: The perceptions & attitudes of teachers (N = 176) are explored using a projective methodology in order to learn more about the culture of India's colleges & universities. In general, the teachers hold negative perceptions of their community & organizational systems. Many hold negative attitudes about other teachers & about colleges & universities as a whole, which indicates a poor work culture with potentially serious consequences for teacher performance. Improved training (including role training), the consideration of personality in teacher selection & employment, & better leadership are required to improve the culture of higher education in India. 2 Tables, 29 References.

Abstract: Discusses lifestyle-related problems of youth, ie, drug use, problem drinking, tobacco use, early experimentation with sex, & injuries & violence. The incidence of these & other similar problems are related to the profound physical, psychological, & social upheavals in the lives of youth as adolescents. Problem behaviors cluster together in the same individual & are also likely to be triggered by peer pressure & unrewarding environments at work, study, or the home. 1 Chart.

Patients in Indian Hospitals: Environmental Stresses and Affective Reactions

Author: Agrawal, Manju1; Dalal, Ajit K1 Dept Psychology Lucknow U, 226007 Uttar Pradesh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61619751?accountid=14925

Abstract: Indian hospitals are characterized by urban bias, overcrowding, depersonalization, routine treatment procedures, & inadequate communication between medical staff & patients. Here, interview data are used to examine patients' (N = 122) affective reactions to this stressful hospital environment. Findings reveal that the characteristic responses of both male & female patients were depression, rationalization, & sense of helplessness. Male patients showed less anger & anxiety than females, but were higer on disengagement & rationalization. 1 Table, 1 Appendix, 17 References. Adapted from the source document.

Land Reforms in Dadra and Nagar Haveli: When a Saranjam Refused to Surrender!

Author: Bhatia, R C; Bhatia, Alka

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61626021?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the historical context of land reform in Dadra & Nagar Haveli, India, where reform occurred only twenty-seven years after independence. The dispute over territorial sovereignty between Portugal & the British is traced, 1947-1961, when Dadra & Nagar Haveli finally merged with the Indian Union. These difficulties led to the delay in implementing land reform in the region. 14 References. Adapted from the source document.

Logical Synthesis of Rational-Emotive Therapy and Cognitive Therapy in the Treatment of Emotional Disturbance

Author: Cheung, Siu-kau11 Division Humanities & Social Sciences City Polytechnic Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61626473?accountid=14925

Abstract: In cognitive behavioral therapy, it is proposed that the client's cognitive distortions & disturbances can be represented by syllogistic reasoning. A model of the cognitive deduction process is presented, which comprises both practical & theoretical syllogistic deductions. In this light, rational-emotive therapy & cognitive therapy can be seen to be complementary in their treatment of emotional disorders. Caveats of the individual approach are discussed, & the logical system comprising practical & theoretical syllogisms is introduced. Implications for clinical practice are considered. 1 Figure, 20 References. Adapted from the source document.

Determinants of the Transition to Marriage among Young Chinese Women in Hong Kong

Author: Luis, B P K1; Chan, Kwok-leung; Choy, Yee-hung1 Dept Applied Social Studies Hong Kong Polytechnic, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61620282?accountid=14925

Abstract: A questionnaire survey was conducted among 692 young adults ages 18-27 in 1986 to explore the social contexts & life events pertaining to the transition to marriage among young Chinese women in Hong Kong. Findings reveal that parental control & social attributes of the family were largely irrelevant. Surprisingly, the gender composition of younger siblings affected the transition in a very gender-specific way, pointing to a subtle psychosexual process between siblings. The sharp increase in marriage following the exit from school indicates that the normative restriction of marriage to those who have finished their education is still adhered to. Christian faith had no bearing on the transition to marriage. Two sexual life events -- romantic love & premarital sex -- were found to be relevant, indicating that a traditional normative connotation is still attached to these acts. 1 Table, 1 Appendix, 16 References. Adapted from the source document.

The 'Astronaut Family'

Author: Hui, Y F

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61620228?accountid=14925

Abstract: Focused interviews with 12 Hong Kong "astronaut" fathers ages 40+ (ie, men whose families have emigrated to other countries, but who return to work in Hong Kong for long periods) investigate the impact of separation. Findings reveal that these men feel pressure to earn a lot of money quickly, because it is the reason they are away from their families & because they will face uncertain futures in their new countries after China assumes Hong Kong in 1997. The men socialize less & with fewer people than before the separation, & say that holidays are difficult. They stand by their decision, but do not recommend it for younger men, citing age & length of marriage as important factors in holding their families together. The mothers & children experience some of the problems of single-parent homes, the stresses of being new immigrants, & emotional loss. Family structure, which in Hong Kong usually means a dominant father & homemaker wife, is disrupted. Male decision-making authority is diminished, & mistrust & marital discord sometimes occur. Social service recommendations are made. 2 Tables, 13 References. E. Blackwell

Mind Your Language: Terminology in the Field of Mental Retardation

Author: Tse, W L John1; Davis, Leonard1 Faculty Humanities & Social Sciences City Polytechnic Hong Kong, Kowloon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61584590?accountid=14925

Abstract: Outdated terminology used to describe the mentally retarded in Hong Kong & elsewhere is identified in glossary form. Terminology should accurately describe the intellectual & adaptive functioning characteristics of the condition, & recognize problems while being positive or neutral, not offensive. Inappropriate or inaccurate terms include: abbreviations such as MR for mental retardation (except in academic journals), mental deficiency, mongolism, learning difficulty, mental age, special, intellectual disability, vegetative, unfortunate, & victim. Sometimes a word is accurate, but a phrase is not, eg, confined to a wheelchair, Down's syndrome people. It is hoped that Hong Kong social workers will communicate proper terminology & positive attitudes toward people with mental retardation to the media & the public. 15 References. E. Blackwell

Patients' Rights: A Perspective

Author: Jesani, Amar1; Nadkarni, Vimla1 Centre Enquiry Health & Allied Themes, 310 Prabhu Darshan Amboli Bombay 400058 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61620135?accountid=14925

Abstract: An introduction to a special journal issue (see related abstracts in SOPODA 16:2) focusing on patient rights. Though the World Health Organization's goal of "Health for All by 2000" was endorsed by numerous countries, health strategies have become separated from lofty universal health sentiments. Health care strategies now emphasize health status targets (eg, sterilization or infant mortality rates) to the extent that primary health care has become little more than selective health care. Previous emphasis on the right to health has shifted to the right to health care; in the transformation, consideration of the needs of people has disappeared. People's needs can be brought back into focus through an emphasis on patients' rights at two levels: (1) basic comprehensive health care for all without regard for capacity to pay, & (2) provision of humane, quality care. 11 References.

Medical Records and Patients' Rights

Author: Bal, Arun; Pilgaonkar, Anil

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61636658?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although the medical establishment has always assumed that the ownership of medical records rests solely with it, it is argued here that patients also have a right to their medical records. Proposed is a kind of joint ownership similar to the ownership of a bank account record. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: In India, the status of women's health care mirrors their overall status in society, reflecting their socioeconomic condition & degree of political power. Any right to health as consumers must, therefore, contain within itself a right to health, which in turn implies many other rights. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61363643?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data from a 1981 survey by the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research in India are drawn on to explore the interstate migration of degree holders & technical personnel (DHTP), differentiating by (1) scientific, technical, & social sciences personnel; (2) sex; & (3) distance moved. Variations in in- & outmigration of DHTP are explained in terms of unemployment level, average income level, & urbanization. Results indicate that: (A) scientific/technical personnel are more migratory than social sciences personnel, & (B) unemployment & expected income level are important factors significantly affecting the in- & outmigration rates of DHTP. 9 Tables, 4 Figures, 2 Appendixes, 15 References.

It is argued that population control policies, framed to further the interest of First World countries & function in the patriarchal social situation, oppress women while denying them choices to promotes their health. Whether antinatalist or pronatalist, the population polices tend to treat women's bodies as instruments of male-dominated populationist ends. 1 Table, 11 References.

Does Enough Work Make Women Free? Part-Time and Full-Time Work Strategies for Women in the United States and Germany

Author: Olsen, Frances11 U California, Los Angeles 90024

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61364278?accountid=14925

Abstract: A critical comparison of the effects of work outside the home on the status of women in the newly reunified Germany vs the US. The exploitation of US women, who work full-time while retaining primary responsibility for child care & homemaking, is contrasted to that of women in (the former) West Germany, many of whom work part-time. Some pitfalls awaiting women of former East Germany (& other parts of the world), regardless of whether they adopt the US or West German pattern for dealing with the double burden of work inside & outside the home, are identified. It is maintained that the privacy of the family is a political myth that disempowers women. Some public policy reforms that alter the sexual division of labor so as to ameliorate the oppression of women are suggested. 5 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61337952?accountid=14925

Abstract: In social scientific action-research projects, the large volume of textual data produced by even a fairly small qualitative study poses special problems in terms of data management. Recent advances in the use of microcomputers for qualitative data management & analysis are described here, focusing on the use of textual data management software & incorporating appropriate coding procedures. 3 Figures, 16 References.

Urbanisation in the Third World Countries

Author: Parmar, Y A11 Dept Sociology South Gujarat U, Surat 395007 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61342096?accountid=14925

Abstract: Draws on statistical data from several sources to document the accelerating growth of urbanization in the Third World since 1950, the continuous increase of population in urban areas, the growth of large cities, & the consequent problems confronting the inhabitants -- eg, slums & poverty. Within their limited resources, Third World countries will have to evolve such a policy that at least a minimum of health & shelter services are made available to the poorest sectors. A comparative picture of the situation in the different countries of the Third World is attempted. 1 Table, 44 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61363382?accountid=14925

Abstract: Scale data obtained from 100 married employed Hindu women ages 20-40 in Dharwad city, India, are used to investigate their attitudes toward dowry with respect to educational, occupational, & income levels. The majority (41%) of respondents expressed a favorable attitude toward dowry, with 26% expressing a medium & 33% an unfavorable attitude. Contrary to expectations, increases in levels of education, occupation, & income of these women have failed to create a negative attitude toward the practice of dowry. 4 Tables, 20 References.

Abstract: Presents a simple diagnostic tool to identify seven forms of sexism in scientific knowledge production. Every component of the research process, eg, title, language, concepts, research design, methods, data interpretation, & ensuing policy recommendations, is combed for its sexist manifestation. Solutions are offered to eliminate sexist bias in all disciplines, irrespective of the subject matter or of the cultural context within which it exists. 1 Appendix, 23 References.

Author: Stanley, Liz1; Wise, Sue1 Dept Sociology U Manchester, M13 9PL England

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61355032?accountid=14925

Abstract: Raises questions concerning substantive feminist research processes in the social sciences & presents ideas about a "feminist fractured foundationalist" epistemology. Components of feminist epistemology that emphasize the necessarily ontological basis of knowledge production include: arguments for the reflexivity of feminist research process; acknowledgement of the contextual specificity of feminist as of all knowledge; & recognition that a researcher's sex, race, class, & sexuality affect what is found in research. 95 References.

Author: Gore, M S11 Indian Council Social Science Research, New Delhi

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61638663?accountid=14925

Abstract: Demographic data from the World Health Organization & other sources indicate a population aging trend in both the developed & developing world. An extended life span makes demands not only on the elderly individual & the medical profession, but also on the larger society. Ways that the society can promote the physical, social, & economic autonomy of the individual elderly are outlined. 5 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Rani, Veena1; Khandelwal, Preetam1 Dept Psychology U Delhi, 110007 Haryana India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61593574?accountid=14925

Abstract: An effort is made to delineate family members' perception of family environment & the nature of interpersonal need structure in 20 dual- & 20 single-career families in Delhi, India. Scale data from the father, mother, son, & daughter in each family indicate that compared to single-career families, dual-career families place significantly more emphasis on cultural & recreational pursuits, independence, & organization; express significantly higher control; & want less control in interpersonal relationships. Females score significantly lower on expressed control & higher on wanted control than do males. Implications of the findings with respect to the socialization of Indian children are discussed. 3 Tables, 24 References. Adapted from the source document.

Author: Sarma, P Gopala1; Satyanarayana, G1 Dept Psychiatry KMC/MGM Hospital, Warangal 506007 Andhra Pradesh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61612368?accountid=14925

Abstract: An attempt is made to profile psychiatric patients visiting temples in Andhra Pradesh, India, in search of a cure for mental illness. Interview data obtained in 1991 from 50 such patients indicate that they: are predominantly rural, illiterate, & belong to disadvantaged castes; have stable marriages & good family support; suffer from chronic illness; & their family members have a perceived sense of failure of modern medicine, though they have only inadequately given it a try. 4 Tables, 4 References.

De-Sanskritisation and High Caste Converts into "Bhangis"

Author: Shyamlal11 Dept Sociology U Jaipur, Rajasthan India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61314016?accountid=14925

Abstract: Though sanskritization, ie, the changeover from lower to higher castes, has received much attention in India, its reverse, desanskritization, has not. Analyzed here is the downward mobility of a population in Rajasthan, where individuals of upper castes or tribes broke away their affiliation with the parent group & culturally incorporated themselves, formally or legally, into the lower castes, acquiring a new low-caste identity. The desanskritization of upper castes into this Bhangi caste ("Bhangiisation") is detailed, drawing on data obtained during field observations & case examples of conversion to describe the processes involved, the reasons for conversion, religious background, employment, etc. 21 References. Adapted from the source document.

Humour as Social Critique

Author: Dhond, M V

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61332597?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on the assumption that mainstream humor perpetuates traditional divisions within society between communities, religions, & genders, & contributes to a bitter division between "us" & "them," examined here are alternative forms of humor in India that, while producing laughter, eliminate social divisions. Four forms of alternative humor that target criticism at the larger society rather than at individuals are reviewed: (1) the Bhana, a single-actor Sanskrit play; (2) the theater of Kutiyattam, presented in Sanskrit & Prakit; (3) the popular folk theater of Maharashtra; & (4) modern cartoons in daily newspapers.

Scheduled Castes and Social Justice: A Karnataka Case in Point

Author: Uplaonkar, Ambarao11 Sharanabasaveshwar Coll Arts, Gulbarga 585 103 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61340988?accountid=14925

Abstract: In India, the centenary of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's birth was recently celebrated as the year of social justice, with many seminars & conferences held to highlight the problems of the scheduled castes. Among Harijan youth, however, it is increasingly argued that there has been no significant change in the socioeconomic status of the former untouchables since independence, as most of the reservation benefits are being taken away by backward & forward castes. Here, this situation is attributed to the imprecise & ambiguous use of the phrase "scheduled caste" in the Indian constitution. An official redefinition of the phrase is called for that will enable the former untouchable castes to reap the maximum benefits of the reservations. 6 References. Adapted from the source document.

A Community Based Study of the Sociological Aspects of Night Blindness in the Desert Region of Rajasthan

Author: Ganguly, K K1; Yadav, Sheshpal; Mahapatra, A; Dam, P K; Krishnamachari, K. A. V. R.1 Regional Medical Research Centre, Jodhpur India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61333761?accountid=14925

Abstract: An analysis of sociological factors contributing to the functional effects of night blindness (NB) in the Thar desert of western Rajasthan, India. The scarcity of leafy vegetables (a source of Vitamin A) in the region increases the incidence of NB. Here, analysis of questionnaire data from 60 children & 24 adults reveals that strong familial & societal bonds help overcome the detrimental effect of NB. While children suffering from NB get sympathy from the society, adult women do not, & adult men seem to ignore the affliction. Ignorance & laxity compound the situation, often with dire consequences for the larger society. A concerted effort to overcome the problem is described that focused on the administration of Vitamin A supplements, & education about NB. 5 References. Adapted from the source document.

Trends and Correlates of Widowhood in India

Author: Sinha, R K11 International Instit Population Sciences, Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61315078?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data from the decennial Indian census, 1901-1981, reveal that widowhood has declined gradually due to improvement in the general mortality situation & the rise in female age at marriage. Additionally, the mean age at first widowhood has also increased. However, general improvement in the widowhood situation is only valid if %s are considered: in terms of absolute numbers, it has deteriorated. 7 Tables, 13 References.

Abstract: Structured interview data from 90 members of 5 milk producers' cooperative socieities in Tamil Nadu, India, are drawn on to identify the major constraints faced by the beneficiaries of Operation Flood (OF), a highly controversial dairy development program. Analysis indicates that low procurement price of milk, pricing of milk on fat content, & poor quality of the feed supplied were significant in vitiating the potential benefits of OF.

Women Employees: An Emerging Issue of HRM in Organisations

Author: Sastry, N11 Dept Humanities & Social Sciences Indian Instit Technology, Bombay 400076

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61297297?accountid=14925

Abstract: The influx of women into the Indian workplace has precipitated clashes between the female (F) behavior encouraged by F socialization & the male (M) corporate culture. In F socialization, Fs are encouraged to work inside the home, or choose F-type occupations; even those holding executive or management positions do so in F-type specializations. Fs generally do not view their jobs as full-time, long-term careers, & have lower self-concepts about their management ability. Fs have less opportunity to enter M-dominated community networks & political systems, & attempts to integrate themselves into the mentoring system may be viewed as sexually motivated. Organizations may reinforce these attitudes by selection, recruitment, & promotion practices. The situation in the workplace could be improved with androgynous sex-role orientation during socialization, the buildup of social & professional networks supportive of women, protection of women's rights in the organization, solutions for child care, & the understanding that overwork at the family's expense is detrimental for both genders. 139 References.

HRD through Training in the Changing Perspective

Author: D'Souza, R11 Xavier Instit Management, Bhubaneswar India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61293683?accountid=14925

Abstract: An Indian industrial organizations design new human resources development (HRD) programs coincident with the rapid development of technology & the globalization of the ecoonomy, on-the-job training will need to consider the actual educational & skill levels of the workers, many of whom have traditional, or even below-standard, educations. Next, the organization's HRD objectives, learning experiences, performance criteria, & effectiveness standards need to be identified. Training programs, however, cannot solve all quality-of-work-life issues. Special programs must be developed to deal with changes in work attitudes & values, & to develop organizational commitment. Self-managed team structures will play an increasingly important role, while the leader's function will consist of monitoring & facilitating the team in its own self-regulation, & in advancing & developing talented subordinates (mentoring). 28 References.

Hierarchy and Modern Organisation: A Paradox Leading to Human Wastage

Author: Chattopadhyay, Gouranga P; Malhotra, Ashok

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61297346?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is contended that the hierarchical structure of many modern organizations is a breeding ground for incompetence, & leads to a waste of human resources. Examination of the concepts of hierarchy & modern organization reveals that the two cannot coexist without producing enormous problems for personnel. Insights derived from the science of psychodynamics are utilized to understand reasons for the survival of hierarchy in modern organizations, & possible means for jettisoning hierarchy are explored. 4 Figures, 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

Personal-Personality, Job and Organisational Correlates of Work Identification

Author: Dolke, A M11 Indian Instit Banking, Bombay 400093

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61293741?accountid=14925

Abstract: The relationship between employee work identification (WI) & various personal-personality, job, & organizational variables is examined using data collected from 567 male technical & clerical personnel working in 6 composite textile mills in Ahmedabad, India, using a 29-item Likert-type scale. Results indicate that WI is significantly related to personal variables of age & tenure, personality variables of locus of control & satisfaction of higher-order needs, & certain dimensions of work value. WI is also related to job variables of challenge & autonomy. The organizational variables related to WI are participation in departmental decision making, supervisory support, perceived chances of rising in the organizational hierarchy, & fulfillment of higher-order needs. 4 Tables, 41 References.

Managerial Value Profile Task and Interaction Facilitation: An Empirical Assessment

Author: Sayeed, O B11 National Instit Training Industrial Engineering, Bombay 400087 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61301092?accountid=14925

Abstract: The construct identity of value profile & the linkage between value profile & esteem for coworkers were investigated with data from 98 banking branch managers in India who completed the Bales-Couch Value Profile Scales ([VPS] a personality measure) & the Least Preferred Coworker Scales (LPCS); 18 of the managers also completed personal orientation inventories. Factor analysis of the VPS data yielded respect for authority, value-determined restraint, egalitarianism, & individualism factors, all relatively independent. ANOVAS between the LPCS, age, & education, & the 4 value dimensions of the VPS yielded a significant main effect for age on respect for authority; age & education individually explained more variation in the 4 dependent variables than did esteem for coworkers, contrary to the hypothesis. Regardless of the lack of statistically significant differences between categories of esteem for coworkers, the moderating influence of esteem for coworkers showing interaction & task facilitation was confirmed with respect to acceptance of authority & egalitarianism. The differences between the Indian & similar US study findings are discussed. 5 Tables, 18 References. Adapted from the source document.

Marital disharmony following head injury

Author: Sabhesan, S; Rajasakthivel, M; Natarajan, M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/42389511?accountid=14925

Abstract: In a prospective follow up of head injured patients, 105 couples were seen at three monthly intervals for a period of 18 months. Marital disturbances were found in 45 couples and seven of them ended in divorce or separation. The disturbances were not related to the age or sex of the patient. Indices of head injury such as biomechanics of injury, duration of coma, length of post traumatic amnesia, persistent neurological disabilities, and neuropsychological impairments were not predictive of marital discord. Behavior changes, particularly irritability and amotivation were most disturbing. Sexual dysfunctions were common among the disturbed couples. Divorce was frequently related to physical violence between the spouses who belonged to nuclear families and had no dependent children. Though joint families were able to provide financial support and protection against divorce, they were not emotionally supportive of the spouses. The need for identifying the marital difficulties early and resolving the conflicts through a multi-disciplinary approach is emphasized. [Author Abstract]

School Performance of Disadvantaged Children: The Educational Resourcefulness Model

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61631546?accountid=14925

Abstract: The literature shows that lower-caste & scheduled tribe children in India perform poorly on scholastic tasks & have a high rate of school dropout. An educational resourcefulness model is proposed to improve the school performance of socioeconomically disadvantaged children. According to this model, self-esteem, sense of personal control, & ability to plan are recognized as cognitive attributes essential to benefit maximally from the given opportunities to learn. The model utilizes an intervention program to indicate educational resourcefulness through teaching games for children in the first year of schooling. The efficacy of such an intervention program in a supportive school environment is discussed. 1 Figure, 51 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61321562?accountid=14925

Abstract: In an investigation of the origin of helplessness, 225 children were classified into mastery-oriented & helpless categories, & by urban & rural background, based on questionnaires. Mothers (N = 86) of these groups completed a socialization questionnaire, measuring their expectancy relating to childhood activities, socialization emphases, childrearing practices, & self-perception. The findings are explained in the framework of the current model of human helplessness. Implications are suggested for planning child management programs that can attenuate helplessness. 3 Tables, 10 Figures, 6 References. Adapted from the source document.

Managing Voluntary Organisations with Limited Finances and Unskilled Personnel

Author: Narayana, E A11 Dept Political Science & Public Administration Nagarjuna U, 522510 Andhra Pradesh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61307032?accountid=14925

Abstract: Income data for a sample of 33 organizations engaged in rural development in Andhra Pradesh are used to examine two major problems experienced by voluntary organizations in India: finance resources & the quality of personnel. The findings indicate that the most important source of funding is from abroad, with roughly 90% of the agencies having access to foreign funds; next in importance are grants from the federal & state governments. The staffing patterns of the organizations reflect the essential Weberian bureaucratic characteristics of hierarchy of authority & division of labor. An overwhelming majority of the personnel did not have technical & professional education & training in their respective organizations.

Author: Jain, Uday11 Dept Psychology Barkatullah Vishwavidyalaya, Bhopal 462026 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61300319?accountid=14925

Abstract: The subjective construction of morality in the prevailing social atmosphere is examined, arguing that attribution of responsibility is involved in moral judgment, & responsibility is understood in distinct ways; further, attribution is also influenced by the social perspective. Data supporting the social aspect of moral judgment are presented, obtained in a study in which 64 Indian college teachers responded to a modified version of L. Kohlberg's Heinz dilemma (eg, see "Moral Stages and Moralization: The Cognitive Developmental Approach" in Lickona [Ed], Moral Development and Behavior: Theory, Research and Social Issues, New York: Holt Reinhart, 1976) & scale measuring perceptions of social atmosphere. Traditional Indian (Hindu) thought on morality is also discussed, along with implications for moral development. 2 Tables, 37 References. Adapted from the source document.

Life events and family consequences among head injured patients

Author: Sabhesan, S; Ramasamy, P; Athiappan, S; Natarajan, M

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/42390487?accountid=14925

Abstract: In a long term prospective follow up of head injured patients and their families, patients admitted in the Trauma Ward between September 1984 and June 1985 were seen three years after the injury. 115 patients, in whom details of life events during the previous 18 months could be studied, were included in the present study. The life changes were classified as those related to head injury disturbances and those occurring independently. Interactional pattern in the family, psychological morbidity in significant family members and burden experienced by family members were studied in relation to life events. Unlike independent events, those related to head injury sequelae were more frequent and accounted for a significant proportion of family disturbances. The nature of the life events indicated that the stress-event-stress cycle was attributable to the behavioural and economic consequences of head injury. [Author Abstract]

Socio-Cultural Influences on Moral Behaviour

Author: Misra, Girishwar11 Barkatullah U, Bhopal India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61293324?accountid=14925

Abstract: The influence of sociocultural factors on the development of moral behavior in Indian children was examined in 4 studies (total N = 488) via questionnaire & scale data. Results show that while moral realism, retribution, & efficiency of severe punishment increased with age, immanent justice was considerably high in almost all age groups. In an additional experimental study on children drawn from this sample, it was noted that level of moral reasoning did not have a significant effect on generosity. However, experimentally created empathy did, not only on generosity, but also on behavior. It is concluded that the pattern of moral behavior has cultural variations &, in view of global changes in the world order, a constitutive orientation toward the conceptualization of individual & morality is warranted. In this context, the Indian conceptualization of man-society as symbiotically related & the idea of Dharma have important implications. 6 Tables, 70 References. Modified AA

Income and Dowry: Some Revealing Connections

Author: Saroja, K1; Chandrika, S M1 Rural Home Science Coll U Agricultural Sciences, Karnataka India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61292379?accountid=14925

Abstract: The myth that better education & employment of women will eradicate the gender-stratifying practice of dowry in India is explored. Statistical analyses of interview & other data obtained from 150 married women reveal that, in certain circumstances, contrary to the myth, social practices for determining the amount of dowry depend on calculations of the family's socioeconomic status & the bride's & groom's educational & occupational levels. Analyses of the various factors reveal the complex ways that market forces help establish informal bidding processes through which a groom price is settled, & though which the community is given a method of groom allocation among bidders that is based on economic status. 4 Tables, 20 References.

POLITICIZED DEMOCRACY: COMPETITION, INSTITUTIONS, AND CIVIC FATIGUE IN BRAZIL

Author: Power, T

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61052528?accountid=14925

Abstract: BRAZIL BEGAN THE 1990S THE SAME WAY IT BEGAN THE 1980S: IN CRISIS. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON RECENT POLITICAL EVENTS IN BRAZIL, INCLUDING THE ADVENT OF THE COLLOR GOVERNMENT AND THE ELECTIONS OF 1990S, IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCT AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF DEMOCRACY. THE ARGUMENT IS BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT, BETWEEN THE COLLAPSE OF AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF POLITICAL DEMOCRACY, THERE EXISTS A LIMITED TIMEFRAME--A WINDOW OF VULNERABILTIY, IN WHICH DEMOCRACTIC ACTORS MUST WORK QUICKLY AND CAREFULLY TO ESTABLISH THOSE INSTITUTIONS, AS WELL AS FORMAL RULES AND PRACTICES, NEEDED TO FORM THE NEW DEMOCRACY.

Abstract: THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET IN PERU EXPERIENCED THE SAME KINDS OF VOLATILITY AND SHOCKS AS THE REST OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY DURING THE 1980S. BECAUSE OF VARIOUS GOVERNMENT IMPOSED LIMITATIONS ON ACCESS TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE, A SIGNIFICANT BLACK MARKET IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WAS BORN, WHICH HAS GROWN, OVER THE DECADES, TO MAKE UP A VERY SIGNIFICANT PART OF TOTAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALINGS IN PERU. THE REASONS FOR BLACK MARKETS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE, PREVIOUS ANALYSES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE BLACK MARKETS AND THE CHARACTERISTICS FOR FOREIGN EXHANGE BLACK MARKETS ARE EXPLORED IN THIS ARTICLE.

Invisibility of the Girl Child in India

Author: Karkal, Malini

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61294393?accountid=14925

Abstract: Statistics for the metropolitan area of Bombay, India, provide evidence of negative male:female (F) ratios among children: Fs have higher child mortality & less access to food, health, education, & recreation, & are induced early into domestic work, marriage, & motherhood. The perpetuation of a cycle of more burden & less care for Fs starts at birth & continues unabashedly during the prime years of growing up, leading to an oppressed womanhood. 13 References.

Sex-Detection Tests and Female Foeticide: Discrimination before Birth

Author: Lingam, Lakshmi11 Women's Studies Unit Tata Instit Social Sciences, 400088 Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61622409?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is contended that sex-determination testing (amniocentesis) in India often leads to abortion of female fetuses (feticide). Societal & government interventions against the practice are examined, & the inadequacy of accurate statistical data is lamented. Maharashtra state legislation's regulation of the use of prenatal diagnostic techniques since 1988 is discussed. It is concluded that the selective abortion of female fetuses perpetuates the negative social worth of women. 23 References. H. L. Stidger

Girl Child: A Lifetime of Deprivation and Discrimination

Author: Ghosh, Shanti11 World Health Organization, New Delhi India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61653155?accountid=14925

Abstract: A variety of statistics are presented that demonstrate discrimination against female (F) children in India, among them: (1) a declining F:male child population ratio, dropping from 972:1,000 in 1901 to 935:1,000 in 1981; (2) poorer nutritional status among F children seen at Safdarjang Hospital in New Delhi, 1986; (3) higher levels of F malnutrition in West Bengal & Punjab during the 1980s; & (4) higher infancy & childhood morbidity & mortality rates for Fs throughout India, 1970-1982. For Fs who achieve puberty, earlier motherhood among immature brides (ages 12-14 in many states) endangers both the young mothers & their babies. Further, their higher illiteracy rates make it almost impossible for Fs to overcome the discrimination against them & improve their overall life chances. 6 Tables, 6 References. J. W. Stanton

The Female Child in a Family Setting

Author: Anandalakshmi, S11 Lady Irwin Coll, New Delhi India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61317566?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interview & other data gathered from 50 traditional craftsmen's & farmers' families in India are used to explore the female (F) child's role in the family. Socialization practices begin early in a child's life, & the F child is already at a disadvantage due to the tradition of overindulging the male at the cost of the F. The data also show a discernible relationship between the nature of the parental occupation, the ecocultural milieu, & the specific aspects of the child's socialization. Adapted from the source document.

Labour of the Indian Girl Child: Multi-Curse, Multi-Abuse and Multi-Neglect

Author: Nayar, Usha S11 Unit Child & Youth Research Tata Instit Social Sciences, Bombay 400088 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61315221?accountid=14925

Abstract: The working conditions of female (F) children in India are explored via census & other data. Highlighted are the lower status & value of F child labor vis-a-vis that of their male counterparts, at home & outside. In addition to occupational hazards, F children are also vulnerable to sexual abuse both at the place of employment & at home. Since poverty is the main reason for child labor, Fs from poor backgrounds, who have other traditional social disadvantages, risk severe exploitation. Suggestions are made to alleviate the the F child plight resulting from the double curse of being F & a laborer. 2 Tables, 14 References. Adapted from the source document.

Girl Child in Red Light Areas

Author: Patkar, Priti

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61287519?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Indian social system has traditionally considered prostitution as a necessary social evil, but the society's failure to provide any kind of care for prostitutes' children has resulted in a growing number of female children who are driven to destitution & ploughed back into the profession. Field experience is drawn on to describe the miserable plight of such girls in the red light area of Kamathipura, Bombay. The need to initiate social work intervention is emphasized. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The socialization of Hindu Brahmin women in nineteenth-century Maharashtra, India, is examined through an analysis of three autobiographies & a biographical novel, highlighting their various roles & lifestyles. The roots of their adaptation to the influences of modernity in adult life lie in their childhood socialization itself. 12 References. Adapted from the source document.

Prostitution and the Girl Child

Author: Pawar, M S11 Dept Criminology & Correctional Administration Tata Instit Social Sciences, 400088 Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61294434?accountid=14925

Abstract: India has sought to abolish the traffic in persons for the purpose of prostitution, not to abolish prostitution itself, though the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (ITPA), 1956, & several state acts. Despite these efforts, sexual exploitation or abuse of females, including children, has continued to grow at an alarming rate. Official statistics & figures provided by the media are examined & compared, revealing that ITPA enforcement leaves much to be desired. Recent amendments to the ITPA have had little impact on the growing phenomenon of sexual exploitation. 4 Tables, 28 References. Adapted from the source document.

Personnel Management Function and Education in a Changing Environment

Author: Misra, Santrupt11 Dept Personnel Management & Industrial Relations Tata Instit Social Sciences, POB 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61624624?accountid=14925

Abstract: The changing environment for business & industrial organizations is discussed, addressing the globalization of business, rising domestic & international competition, decreasing time lag between a technical discovery & commercial use, & concern for more investment in human resources. Personnel management in India will encounter a new generation of workers with higher pre-employment education acquired from nontraditional sources; these employees will be more individualistic, questioning, & have a greater frame of reference, & may need to be integrated with union & organizational values. Implications for personnel management education include moving management education toward a mode that emphasizes skills more than functions. 20 References. V. Wagener

Trade Unionism: Problems for the Nineties

Author: Tulpule, Bagaram

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61636940?accountid=14925

Abstract: A successful aspect of the trade union movement in India has been its ability to protect & promote members' interests in the workplace; however, fragmentation of ideology, & more recently, problems of personality, caste, & region, have occurred. National leadership is unlikely to begin to attend to socioeconomic & basic class interests of workers because local leaders continue to focus on immediate demands & personal benefits. A plea is made for reversing the process, unifying the trade union movement, & making trade unions representative of workers in the broadest sense of the term. V. Wagener

National Housing Policy: A Critique

Author: Reddy, I U B11 Unit Urban Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, PO Box 8313 Deonar Bombay 400088 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61607289?accountid=14925

Abstract: The objectives, strategies, & land & finance conditions of India's first National Housing Policy, finalized Dec 1987, are summarized. Positive aspects of the policy include creation of institutional facilities for housing finance & loans with subsidy schemes; promotion of access to shelter for disadvantaged groups such as the poor, certain castes, bonded laborers, widows, & victims of natural calamities; & enabling urban slum dwellers & squatters to get title & learn how to maintain property. Lacunae are that the policy does not specify details & places the government as a facilitator instead of an active participant in providing housing. 8 References. V. Wagener

Author: Sayeed, Omer Bin11 National Instit Training Industrial Engineering, Vihar Lake Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61519294?accountid=14925

Abstract: Open-ended questionnaire data obtained from 82 managers of various organizations in India were used to develop a scale measuring organizational commitment under unstructured & structured conditions, which was then administered to a second group of 204 managers. Results indicate that the longer an individual has been with an organization that has good fringe benefits, cordial management-subordinate relationships, & positive organizational policies, the greater is the level of commitment & period of attachment to the organization. The scale is found to have highly satisfactory item total correlations & alpha reliabilities; it is appended. 7 Tables, 1 Appendix, 8 References. Modified AA

Author: Thilagaraj, R11 Dept Criminology U Madras, 600005 Tamil Nadu India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61236262?accountid=14925

Abstract: A comparative investigation of the psychological association between goal-oriented behavior & degree of risk for delinquents vs nondelinquents, viewing risk as perceived on the basis of previous success or failure experience. A variation of J. Rotter's "level of aspiration board" was used to measure goal-risk behavior among 180 delinquent & nondelinquent students ages 13-17 in Chengalput, India. Results revealed that both groups displayed similar risk behavior in a goal situation involving risk. In the well-adjusted Ss, while motivation to achieve high goals prevailed despite risk factors, a favorable or unfavorable experience affected subsequent risk behavior; the delinquents did not demonstrate a similar learning process, repeating risk tasks associated with failure experiences. 6 Tables, 1 Figure, 15 References.

What the Poor Think about Their Poverty -- A Socio-Psychological Study

Author: Sharma, A K11 Dept Humanities & Social Sciences Indian Instit Technology, IIT PO Kanpur 208016 Uttar Pradesh

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61259797?accountid=14925

Abstract: Focusing on subjective & cognitive aspects of poverty, the goals of the impoverished, motivation to improve their condition, & development of locus of control are examined, based on both quantitative & qualitative fieldwork data, among poor & nonpoor residents (N = 506 & 79, respectively) of developed & developing villages in rural India. Lack of productive work for a largely landless population is the main cause of poverty in rural areas, creating food, clothing, & housing inadequacies. Nonpoor show little concern for the poor & their dissatisfaction with leadership to improve societal conditions. It is contended that while the rural poor are complacent regarding social change, they demonstrate an internal locus of control despite their dependency, & a unique & somewhat hopeful perception of their economic condition given government aid. 6 Tables, 10 References.

Ethnicity, Power and Discontent: The Problem of Identity Reconstruction in a Pluralist Society

Author: Mohan, Brij11 Louisiana State U, Baton Rouge 70803

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61262684?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on the increasing immigration of Asians from the Indian subcontinent to the US is reviewed, focusing on patterns of ethnic relationships among the immigrants, obstacles to their success & adaptation, & identity crisis & other implications of their alienated status. Ethnic differentiation & inequalities promote stereotypes & prejudices that create obstacles to survival & success & negatively affect the development of an Indo-American identity. Despite barriers, Asian Indians generally comprise a productive, achievement-oriented community, with different internal classes based on religion, caste, economic status, language, & regional background. However, their own color & class consciousness in a racist (US) society create distrust & discontent. A cloutless minority in a culture of capitalism, they enjoy little influence in policy making & resource allocation. Despite the culturally inspired tolerance of the Indian character, evidence of increasing divorce, suicide, & homicide rates reveals stress at both the individual & family level, similar to that mirrored in US society generally. It is argued that identity reconstruction is a pragmatic ethnic process of adaptation & survival. 1 Table, 40 References. S. Millett

Occupational Mobility in an Industrial-Urban Setting

Author: Dahiwale, S M11 Dept Sociology Shivaji U, Kolhapur 416004 Maharashtra India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61264400?accountid=14925

Abstract: The occupational mobility of self-employed Indians of scheduled castes in the industrial secular city of Kolhapur is analyzed, based on interviews with 200 respondents (Rs) in modern occupations & 30 in caste-based traditional occupations, eliciting data on sources of mobility, type of modern occupations adopted, & the effects on mobility of caste, religion, education, age, gender, & family background. The findings indicate that the subjective, motivational determinants of mobility for these Rs included encouragement by social networks, economic hardships, ideological impact, & educational qualifications. Objective factors included a government policy of protective discrimination toward depressed groups & the historical influences of city founder Shahu Chhatrapati & of Christian missionaries. 4 Tables, 3 References.

Psychotherapy with Addicts

Author: Surati, Munira

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61573608?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data obtained in a questionnaire survey of 75 psychiatrists in 8 cities of India are used to examine psychotherapeutic approaches used in the treatment of drug addicts. The majority of respondents (Rs) supported an eclectic approach, combining behavioral therapy, reality therapy, & vocational counseling. Only 9 Rs utilized the psychoanalytic approach, while 21 used family therapy primarily. The specific ways that several therapies, eg, behavior therapy & group therapy, can be used to address the issue of drug addiction are described. Because of the length of time needed for treatment, psychoanalytic therapy requires a high level of motivation, which is difficult to achieve among drug addicts; behavior therapy is viewed as the brightest hope for treating addicts. 2 Tables, 16 References.

Children of Single Parents in a Slum Community

Author: Bharat, Shalini11 Unit Family Studies Tata Instit Social Sciences, Deonar Bombay 400088 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61572539?accountid=14925

Abstract: Children (N = 36) of single-parent families who live in a slum of a Bombay, India, suburb are compared with a sample of children (N = 31) from intact families, focusing on incidence of socioemotional, economic, & educational problems. Analysis of interview data indicates that children in single-parent families felt a sense of loss regarding the absent parent & often were more affected by the socioeconomic problems of their social class than were children of intact parents; eg, single parenthood may be somewhat associated with early child employment. Contrary to the findings in Western studies, however, the prevalence of juvenile delinquency, drug addiction, & other bad habits was found to be low. 1 Table, 14 References. Modified HA

Are the Poor Less Intelligent? Or Much Ado about Nothing

Author: Singh, Anup Kumar

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61037962?accountid=14925

Abstract: Various studies in India & other nations from the early 1950s to the present have shown that the verbal intelligence of students of lower socioeconomic status is correspondingly low. It is suggested that these low IQ scores do not necessarily imply an innate inferiority; rather, poorer groups are at a disadvantage when taking IQ tests. All children exhibit equal intelligence skills in their respective environments: testing lower class children by middle class norms produces low scores. Even if intelligence is genetic, there are chances for great improvement. 37 References. Modified HA

Abstract: An examination of the effect of urbanization on the income & consumption patterns of tribal farmers in the Baripada Block of Mayurbhanj district of Orissa State, India. A survey methodology was utilized to: (1) determine the level of disposable income of small & marginal farmers & rural villages; (2) define the consumption pattern of categories of tribal farmers of specific village types; & (3) estimate the consumption function of categories of small farmers of urban & rural villages. Ss (N not specified) were defined as urban or rural by their geographic position, & as marginal or small by farm size. Findings show that marginal & small farmers of urban villages had a higher level of total disposable income as compared to farmers from rural villages. The level of total disposable income was higher in small farms as compared to marginal farms. The tribal farmers of higher income groups spent a higher % of the total disposable income on nonfood items as compared to lower income groups. The propensity for marginal consumption was higher in lower income groups. 8 Tables, 7 References. Modified HA

Author: Kumar, N Ashok1; Gnaneshwar, V1 Regional Centre Ur & Environmental Studies Osmania U, Hyderabad 500007 Andhra Pradesh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61554331?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Ur Basic Services (UBS) program was established to improve the living conditions of the Ur poor in India by inculcating community spirit & providing primary education, health, & vocational training services. Designed as a comprehensive & integrated scheme to avoid the sectoral approach that had been the downfall of previous schemes, UBS was launched by the Indian government in the seventh plan period, 1981-1983, with the involvement of UNICEF, the central government, the state & local governments, & voluntary community agencies. The program did not achieve the anticipated results in the first part of the period, for complex & multiple reasons. Suggested remedial measures include more participation by voluntary agencies & more clarity of needs, goals, & roles. Modified HA

Child Labour in India: Extent and Associated Factors

Author: Kanbargi, Ramesh11 Population Research Centre Instit Social & Economic Change, Bangalore 560072 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61578205?accountid=14925

Abstract: Child labor is blamed both for the persistent high fertility in the Third World & for the poor progress made in primary schooling. The extent of child labor & its correlates in India are examined by looking at available scattered data & some empirical investigations. Children suffer exploitation in the Ur LF & remain tied to traditional occupations in Ru areas. The occupations in which children are most often exploited are in the match & carpet-weaving industries & in chilli, cotton, & groundnut cultivation. Girls work longer hours than boys in all age groups. The adverse effect of early LF participation on schooling is clear from the studies reviewed. Modified HA

Female Population, Literacy and Employment -- Some Observations

Author: Rani, T Jyothi1; Rajaiah, B1 Kakatiya U, Vidyaranyapuri Warangal 500009 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61529396?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite advancement in various aspects of social life, the F in India is viewed from birth as an economic liability. This has resulted in the widening gap between M & F population from 1901 to 1981. It is argued that the use of amniocentesis as a sex determination test & subsequent abortion of F fetuses will exacerbate the problem of the sex ratio. Data pertaining to literacy reveal the continuing educational gap between Ms & Fs. Low work participation by Fs in organized employment, coupled with employment primarily in poorly paid work, is responsible for the low SES of women. 6 Tables, 4 References. Modified HA

Knowledge of and Attitude towards the Legislation on Age at Marriage and Their Influence on Ideal Age at Marriage

Author: Audinarayana, N11 International Instit Population Sciences, Bombay India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61554256?accountid=14925

Abstract: Familiarity with & attitude toward the 1978 legislation raising the legal age of marriage to 18 for girls & 21 for boys were tested in a survey of residents of Ru India (N = 240 caste Hindus & 120 Harijans). Though knowledge of the legislation was not widespread, when informed, most Rs were in favor of the new minimum ages, as were those who already knew of the law. Caste Hindu Rs were more knowledgeable & more favorably inclined than the Harijans, who cling to the tradition of early age at marriage, especially for girls. 5 Tables, 7 References. Modified HA

Aged Females: The Most Deprived among the Deprived

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61578138?accountid=14925

Abstract: Aged (55+) men's & women's numbers (sex ratio), economic participation, living arrangements, & SS were examined among a stratified random sample of 214 Indian households (total N = 1,002). The relatively low age minimum was chosen to take premature aging due to inadequate nutrition into account. Contrary to expectations, the number of aged Ms exceeded that of Fs in the sample. Aged Ms participated more in economic activities. Widowed Fs more often than Ms were left to fend for themselves in single-person households, demonstrating the differential treatment by adult children. 8 Tables, 4 References. Modified HA

Dowry-Related Violence towards Women -- Some Issues

Author: Prasad, B Devi1; Vijayalakshmi, B1 Dept Social Work Andhra U, Waltar 530003 Andhra Pradesh India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60987262?accountid=14925

Abstract: In contemporary Indian society, persistent demands for dowry can lead to violent conduct by the in-laws toward the bride. A review of the literature shows that the victims of such dowry-related violence are usually young, of dependent status, & lack education. Gathering evidence about dowry-related crimes is difficult &, very frequently, the dying victim may herself save the guilty. Amendments to the Dowry Prohibition Act & the preventive legislation brought about by the central government, have not yet proven effective. Voluntary action is needed to prevent violence against women & to make the anti-dowry movement strong. 20 References. Modified HA

Bombay's Weaker Sections -- A Survey of Their Levels of Living

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61563921?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data collected during a 1978 survey of 2,000 households (composed of slum settlement & pavement dwellers) are used to examine the nature of poverty in greater Bombay, India, with focus on migration, employment, housing, access to amenities, & the SE parameters of poverty. Results show that the majority of migrants in Bombay have come from other districts of Maharashtra rather than from other states, as commonly believed. Income levels in a caste-based distribution of the sample are described, along with factors responsible for entitlement to housing. Differences in access to amenities are identified as well as a "resource-sharing" phenomenon, whereby the hardships arising out of economic pressures are countered through sharing. 24 Tables, 1 Illustration, 17 References.

Preparing for the 1991 Census of India

Author: Mahatme, Anand

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60978638?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 1961 India transformed its census taking from a descriptive exercise to collecting population information for developmental planning purposes & began using modern methods. However, the methods introduced in 1961 should be evaluated carefully before they are used in 1991. The delay in getting the data to users in the 1981 census is noted, & some suggestions are made for enhancing the comparability of 1961-1981 data. Improvements are suggested in the areas of enumeration & administration, & it is argued that data users should be more involved in census planning. 1 Reference. A. Waters

A Study of Dowry among Working and Non-Working Women

Author: Sandhu, M K11 Dept Sociology Panjab U, Chandigarh 160014 Union Territory India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/60969357?accountid=14925

Abstract: The practice of giving a dowry among middle class Indian families of working & nonworking women & its consequences are explored using data from interviews with 150 women working in selected government departments & 150 nonworking wives of men employed in the same departments. Results show that dowry was given in a majority of the women's marriages, regardless of work status, indicating that economic independence of women does not constitute a solution to the problem. Dowry was perceived to be a problem for the middle & lower middle classes, who are not well off financially & who seek to enhance their social status by marrying daughters into a higher stratum. Although respondents were disinclined to accept that dowry might have caused problems to their parents, they perceived it as a problem for society in general. 11 Tables, 12 References. Modified HA

Promiscuity and Family Pathology

Abstract: To test the hypothesis that promiscuity is deeply ingrained in the personality of the individual & is a product of early life experiences, 30 promiscuous Ms aged 18-22 & a matched control group of 30 nonpromiscuous Ms were compared in terms of their family interactions. Data collected via in-home observations, interviews, & a family interaction scale indicate that the interactions within different subsystems are defective in the families of promiscuous Ms. The results are discussed in light of developmental theories. 2 Tables, 9 References.

Vocational Restitution after Head Injury

Author: Sabhesan, S1; Arumugham, R; Ramasamy, P; Andal, G; Natarajan, M1 Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470159?accountid=14925

Abstract: Follow-up interview data are used to examine the occupational rehabilitation & resettlement of 75 head-injured M agriculturists admitted to the trauma ward of the Dept of Neurosurgery, Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, India. Though neurological deficits interfered with work restoration for only 2 patients, psychological sequelae, particularly cognitive/behavioral disturbances & disturbed interpersonal relations, were prevalent. Intrinsic factors -- eg, age, severity of damage, early neurological deficits, & alcohol abuse -- & extrinsic factors -- eg, financial status & family attitudes -- were found to significantly influence the work restoration. 3 Tables, 18 References.

Perceived Likelihood of Rape as an Operational Measure of Rape Victim's Causal Responsibility

Author: Kanekar, Suresh1; Shirgavi, Kamal1 Dept Applied Psychology U Bombay, Vidyanagari 400098 India

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61470333?accountid=14925

Abstract: Perceived likelihood of rape is examined as an operational measure of the causal responsibility attributed to a rape victim based on judgments of written case accounts of a rape incident by 240 U of Bombay (India) undergraduate students. The accounts varied in the physical attractiveness of the victim & the psychological & physical injuries inflicted. The dependent measures included the length of the recommended imprisonment for the rapist & the perceived likelihood of rape. Longer imprisonment was recommended for the rapist when the victim was physically hurt & emotionally disturbed; greater likelihood was perceived when the victim was attractive. These findings are discussed in the context of a proposed theoretical distinction between causal & moral responsibility. 1 Table, 16 References. Modified HA
