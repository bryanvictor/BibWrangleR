Abstract: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed HIV-related illness from terminal to chronic by suppressing viral load which results in immunologic and clinical improvement. Success with ART is dependent on optimal adherence, commonly categorized as > 95%. As medication type, class and frequency of use continue to evolve, we assessed adherence levels related to viral suppression. Using a cross-sectional analysis with secondary data (n = 381) from an ongoing multi-site study on impact of ART on the Central Nervous System (CNS), we compared self-reported adherence rates with biological outcomes of HIV-RNA copies/ml, and CD4 cell/mm3. Adherence to ART measures included taking all prescribed medication as directed on schedule and following dietary restrictions. While depression was a barrier to adherence, undetectable viral suppression was achieved at pill adherence percentages lower than 95%. Practice, research and policy implications are discussed in the context of patient-, provider-, and system-level factors influencing adherence to ART. Adapted from the source document.

Medication Adherence Among Adolescents With HIV: A Case Study of Social Work Interventions

Author: Fair, Cynthia D1; Osherow, Janet; Albright, Jamie; McKeone, Daniel1 Human Service Studies, Elon University, Elon, North Carolina, USA cfair@elon.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531929087?accountid=14925

Abstract: The number of adolescents living with HIV is increasing globally. Within the United States, there are over 40,000 youth, 13-24 years old, living with HIV infection. Adherence to antiretroviral medication among this population is critical to promote health and decrease the risk of secondary HIV transmission. However, only approximately one-third of adolescents adhere to their HIV medications. Social workers are in a unique position to help support adolescents and their families with medication adherence. The authors describe a case study of the introduction of social work services to a cohort of high-risk youth who previously did not have access to a pediatric social worker. Three case examples are included to illustrate the wide array of family needs and strengths as well as social work interventions used to promote medication adherence as measured by immune functioning and viral load. Significant improvements in CD4 counts and viral loads were found following the implementation of social work services. Findings indicated that individualized social work interventions can improve medication adherence and the subsequent health of adolescents living with HIV. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to assess (a) perceptions of the physician-patient relationship among youth with HIV and (b) the relationship between the perceived physician-patient relationship and disease management variables. Participants were 72 youth with HIV ages 13-24. The Patient Reactions Assessment (PRA) and the Adolescent Patient-Provider Interaction Scale (APPIS) were administered. Results suggest positive perceptions among youth with HIV about their relationship with their physicians. There was a significant correlation between PRA and APPIS scores. However, there were no significant correlations between scores on the PRA and APPIS and demographic or disease management variables. Adapted from the source document.

A Five-Step Process for Interactive Parent-Adolescent Communication About HIV Prevention: Advice From Parents Living With HIV/AIDS

Author: Edwards, Laura L1; Reis, Janet S1 Department of Kinesiology and Community Health, College of Medicine, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531928658?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors investigated how parents living with HIV/AIDS communicate about HIV prevention with their 10- to 18-year-old children. Semistructured interviews with 76 mothers and fathers were analyzed for (a) their experiences discussing HIV prevention with adolescents and (b) advice for other parents about how to best broach HIV-related topics. Interactive conversations were regarded as particularly effective. A five-step process for interactive communication emerged as a result of these discussions. Parents emphasized that adolescents should have a 'voice' and a 'choice' in HIV-related talks. Health care professionals can facilitate adolescent sexual health by encouraging parents to actively involve their children in discussions about HIV prevention. Future HIV prevention programs could benefit by providing parents with appropriate tools to foster interactive discussions about sexual health with adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

Focused and Motivated: A Psychoeducational Group for Parents Living With HIV

Author: Mason, Sally1; Vazquez, Deborah; Mason, Rhapsody1 Institute for Juvenile Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA smason@psych.uic.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531929964?accountid=14925

Abstract: To understand the beneficial aspects of a psychoeducational group, parents living with HIV participated in two telephone interviews. Twelve parents answered open-ended questions about program processes, components, and activities. Study participants identified five processes: focused and motivated; learn from each other; share freely with people who understand; support and care about each other; respect each other's privacy; and protect each other. The identified knowledge areas-self-care, parenting, and goal-setting-were consistent with the program's focus. Components noted were those activities designed to develop comfort between participants, share ideas, and practice skills. Goal-setting and monitoring progress represented a primary task that brought focus to the group's endeavors and around which knowledge was shared and feedback and support were provided, strengthening the bonds between the participants. As people with HIV are living longer, programming can take a future orientation, supporting parents in raising children and leading productive lives. Adapted from the source document.

An Exploration of African American Women's Perceptions of the Intersection of Domestic Violence and HIV/AIDS

Author: Bent-Goodley, Tricia B11 Howard University, Washington, DC, USA tbent-goodley@howard.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1531928973?accountid=14925

Abstract: The author explores the perceptions of the intersection of HIV and domestic violence from a cultural context among a sample of professional African American women, and how social workers can better respond to the intersection. While African American women compose 13% of the U.S. female population, they represent 64% of U.S. HIV cases among women. The aim of this study was to generate an understanding of how HIV and domestic violence intersect for African American women. Four focus groups were conducted with three cohorts of 22 African American/Caribbean American women for 12 focus groups. There were five major themes generated from the study: being from a low-income community is not always the major factor, relationships are complex and viewed as essential, HIV is serious but perceived risk is low, fear is a driving force of decision-making regarding relationships, and the strength of communalism is perceived as having diminished in the African American community. Implications for social work practice include creating greater awareness of the intersections between HIV, domestic violence and cultural context among African American women and to enhance the social work response to these intersections in practice, policy, and research. Adapted from the source document.

Turning the Corner on the HIV Epidemic Among Adolescents: Prioritizing Directions for Future Prevention Research

Author: DiClemente, Ralph J11 Rollins School of Public Health, Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education, and Emory Center for AIDS Research, Atlanta, Georgia, USA rdiclem@emory.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299234?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article discusses the prioritizing directions for future HIV prevention research for adolescents. The HIV epidemic among adolescents continues to exact a heavy toll in suffering, morbidity, mortality, and expenditures in fiscal and human resources, both in the United States and globally, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Most importantly, various programs have demonstrated programmatic efficacy in reducing HIV-associated sexual and drug use behaviors and reducing new HIV infections. A vaccine is not in the foreseeable future, and, even assuming a vaccine were to become available, it may require multiple doses and may not be 100% effective at preventing HIV acquisition. In addition, some adolescents who might benefit from vaccination may elect to not adopt the vaccine or may not be able to be vaccinated without parental permission. Thus, from my perspective, there is a clear, cogent, and compelling urgency to intensify HIV prevention efforts. Prevention efforts need to be tailored to accommodate the social realities and needs of adolescents living with HIV who continue to engage in transmission behaviors, as well as adolescents who are HIV negative but engage in HIV-associated behaviors.

Abstract: Developing theory-driven and culturally appropriate support for treatment adherence is critical to positive health outcomes in adolescents and emerging adults living with HIV/AIDS. Romanian young long-time HIV survivors represent a special population requiring urgent assessment of specific adherence-support needs. The authors adapted the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model of adherence to this population via thematic analysis of data from focus groups with service users and medical professionals. In addition to adherence-relevant themes identified in previous IMB-model research, new themes such as the role of informational conflicts, long-term goals and altruistic motivation emerged as important factors in this sample of long-term nosocomially infected young adults.

Barriers to Provider-Delivered Sexual Behavior Counseling for Youth Living With HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Author: Parker, Lisa1; Maman, Suzanne; Pettifor, Audrey; Chalachala, Jean Lambert; Edmonds, Andrew; Golin, Carol Elaine; Moracco, Kathryn; Behets, Frieda1 Futures Group, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA lparker@futuresgroup.com

Abstract: In this study, the authors aimed to understand providers' role in delivering HIV transmission prevention counseling to youth living with HIV (YLWH). Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with providers in Kinshasa, DRC. Providers' lack of knowledge and comfort in talking to youth about sex because of cultural and religious beliefs about sexuality, coupled with confusion about legal issues related to youth and contraception, made it difficult for them to effectively counsel youth. For providers to deliver effective prevention counseling to YLWH, clinics should follow adolescent-friendly clinic standards, provide counseling in an adolescent-friendly style, and institute an effective referral system for additional prevention services. HIV prevention services can be improved through the creation of an adolescent-friendly environment and by providing "values clarification" and skill-based trainings so that providers are able to assess the role of their own beliefs and learn new skills.

Disease-Specific Knowledge Among HIV-Infected Adolescents: What Do They Know and How Do They Learn It?

Author: Barnes, William M1; Abramowitz, Susan; Lagrange, Ricardo; Chandwani, Sulachni; Moschel, David; Koenig, Linda J1 Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA wbarnes@cnmc.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299069?accountid=14925

Abstract: Disease knowledge is an important component of medication self-management. We examined HIV knowledge and understanding among 166 HIV-infected 13- to 21-year-olds (53% female, 72.9% African American, 59.6% perinatally infected). Behaviorally infected youth outperformed perinatally infected youth on HIV transmission knowledge and were more likely to report provider discussions about getting condoms and how drugs impair sexual decision making. While youth accurately answered most (78%) true/false questions, many could not define resistance (71.0%), viral load (59.0%), or CD4 (43.4%). Only 29.5% reported knowing either their CD4 count or viral load. Provider discussions about biomarkers likely contribute to greater HIV knowledge and understanding, especially for youth with lower CD4 counts, perhaps because illness triggers extended provider discussions. Adapted from the source document.

Integrating Behavioral HIV Interventions Into Biomedical Prevention Trials With Youth: Lessons From Chicago's Project PrEPare

Author: Hosek, Sybil G1; Green, Keith R; Siberry, George; Lally, Michelle; Balthazar, Christopher; Serrano, Pedro A; Kapogiannis, Bill1 John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois, USA shosek@cookcountyhhs.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299433?accountid=14925

Abstract: On the heels of several trials demonstrating the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and the recent approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the supplemental indication for emtricitabine-tenofovir as PrEP, researchers, advocates, and community providers are calling for the investigation of implementation strategies that combine behavioral interventions with biomedical prevention. The authors describe the modification and integration of an evidence-based group-level intervention into a small PrEP pilot trial with young men who have sex with men. The behavioral intervention and ongoing risk reduction counseling sessions were found to be highly acceptable among a sample of racially diverse young men who have sex with men.

Author: Miller, Robin Lin1; Reed, Sarah J; McNall, Miles A; Forney, Jason C1 Department of Psychology, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494298986?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors examined lifetime prevalence of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and physical violence, in a statewide sample of 180 Black gay and bisexual males ages 14 to 24. Rates of exposure to each form of abuse was high; 33% reported sexual assault, 74% reported at least one type of physical violence, and 91% reported at least one type of emotional abuse. Co-occurring trauma was the dominant pattern. Sexual assault and number of types of trauma experienced were associated with inconsistent condom use. Physical violence and number of types of trauma experienced were associated with depression and substance abuse. Implications for intervention are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

"What Could Have Been Different": A Qualitative Study of Syndemic Theory and HIV Prevention Among Young Men Who Have Sex With Men

Author: Lyons, Thomas1; Johnson, Amy K; Garofalo, Robert1 HIV/AIDS Research and Policy Institute, Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois, USA tlyons20@csu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299627?accountid=14925

Abstract: Young men who have sex with men (MSM) experience multiple health disparities, including alcohol and drug use, partner violence, victimization due to sexual orientation, and HIV infection. Syndemic theorists explain the clustering of these disparities among adult MSM as a result of cultural marginalization. To date, research on a similar emerging syndemic among young MSM has been limited to quantitative studies. The authors seek to better understand these disparities, and how they may cluster together, via qualitative interviews with 21 ethnically diverse, HIV-infected young MSM aged 18 to 24 years. These youth report a lack of gay-specific HIV prevention education, absence of role models, and lack of productive future goal-related activities as factors related to their acquisition of HIV and downplay substance use as a factor. Although not necessarily the components traditionally cited by syndemic theorists, these findings support the notion that multiple factors of cultural marginalization cluster together in the lives of young MSM and underscore the importance of community-level interventions, such as sexual health education, access to mentors, and assistance with future goal setting and planning. Adapted from the source document.

Masculine Ideology, Norms, and HIV Prevention Among Young Black Men

Author: Hall, Naomi M1; Applewhite, Sheldon1 Department of Psychological Sciences, Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA hallna@wssu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1494299410?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examines the relationship between masculine ideology, adherence to norms, and HIV prevention among young Black heterosexual and gay men on the campus of a historically Black college/university. The data from four focus groups and nine individual interviews (N = 35) were aggregated and two recurring themes emerged: sexual communication and mate availability. Additional themes related to HIV prevention were stigma, protection, and testing. The importance of investigating masculinity with young men is highlighted and implications for professionals working with college students to prevent the transmission of HIV are included. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: HIV prevalence amongst 15-19 year olds in South Africa is 6.7% and 2.5% in females and males respectively. Using an interviewer-administered cross-sectional survey, we examined individual, interpersonal, family and community factors associated with sexual activity and condom use among 506 adolescents 16-18 years from Soweto, Johannesburg. The sample was mainly female (59%, n = 298). Using multivariate logistic regression, males (OR:2.6, CI: 1.4-4.8), older partners (OR:4.5, CI: 1.5-13.8), hazardous alcohol use (OR:2.4, CI: 1.1-5.2) and permissive attitudes about sex (OR:1.6, CI: 1.3-2.1) predicted sexual activity. A first partner at a younger age (OR:1.2, CI: 1.1-1.4) and having older partners (OR:0.29, CI: 0.13-0.68) predicted lack of condom use. For females, increasing age (OR:2.7 CI:1.4-5.5), older partners (OR: 3.3 CI:1.4-7.6), and permissive attitudes about sex (OR: 1.6 CI:1.2-2.1) predicted sexual activity. Multiple levels have to be addressed in developing HIV prevention programs for adolescents in Soweto. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The fragmentation of HIV-related diagnostic and treatment services, especially for youth, is a significant barrier for engaging in care. The authors identified key elements that affected care linkage efforts and conducted 64 interviews across 15 clinical sites. The constant comparative method was used. Primary linkages to care processes are illustrated through three geographically diverse case studies. Factors included interagency relationships, data-sharing protocols, and service duplication concerns. Program improvement strategies were discussed. A strong, citywide network is helpful in coordinating care linkage services. These partnerships will be critical in effectively realizing the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: To serve the unique needs of HIV-positive adolescents, an adolescent-focused HIV program, which included clinical, psychosocial, and community-based services, was established in rural Rwanda. From October 1, 2009, to February 1, 2011, 206 HIV-positive adolescents aged 11 to 19 years were enrolled, of whom 10 transferred care out of the program. Overall, 191 (97.5%) of 196 adolescents were retained, 4 (2%) were lost to follow-up, and 1 (0.5%) died. Median follow-up time was 4.6 (interquartile range 3.2 to 5.7) years. Among 124 patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 1 year, median CD4 increase was 347 cells/mm3(36 to 553), and 87% achieved virologic suppression (<500 copies/mL). Clinic attendance was high, with 90.8% and 88.5% of ART-initiated and pre-ART patients, respectively, attending the clinic within 90 days of the end of the follow-up period. Our findings suggest that integrated, comprehensive, and youth-friendly clinics for HIV-positive adolescents can be successful in rural, resource-poor settings. Adapted from the source document.

A Multilevel Path Analysis of Risk Perception and Risky Sexual Behavior Under the Framework of the Health Belief Model

Author: Tenkorang, Eric Y11 Department of Sociology, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada ytenko@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463025690?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Health Belief Model is a path analytical framework that identifies risk perception among other variables as very crucial to safer sexual behaviors. Yet, very few studies have examined what influences risk perception itself and the simultaneity of the relationship between risk perception and sexual behaviors. Using data from the Cape Area Panel Survey and applying multilevel path models, this study examined what influences risk perception and sexual behaviors, focusing on the complexities of the relationship between the two variables. The study also examined the effects of poverty at the community level on risk perception and sexual behaviors. Results indicate a negative relationship between risk perception and sexual risk-taking. At the community level, poverty impacts sexual risk-taking positively but risk perception negatively. Adapted from the source document.

Psychosocial Outcomes of Sexual Risk Reduction in a Brief Intervention for Urban African American Female Adolescents

Author: Bangi, Audrey1; Dolcini, M Margaret; Harper, Gary W; Boyer, Cherrie B; Pollack, Lance M1 Harder+Company Community Research, San Francisco, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463025627?accountid=14925

Abstract: The authors describe psychosocial outcomes of a group randomized controlled trial of a friendship-based HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention intervention grounded in the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (ARRM). A total of 264 African American adolescent girls were randomized to a single-session Project ORE HIV/STI prevention intervention or a nutrition/exercise health promotion intervention with their friendship group. At posttest, Project ORE participants scored higher on knowledge of HIV/STI prevention and protection (p < .01), knowledge of living with HIV/STI (p < .01), perceived HIV risk (p < .05), perceived STI risk (p < .01), and intentions to use condoms for vaginal sex (p < .05). Findings suggest that a brief friendship-based HIV/STI prevention intervention for youth can impact ARRM factors that increase the ability to recognize and label risky sexual behaviors as problematic and promote commitment to changing high-risk behaviors.

Online Activities for Enhancing Sex Education Curricula: Preliminary Evidence on the Effectiveness of the Abstinence and Contraception Education Storehouse

Author: Raghupathy, Shobana1; Klein, Charles; Card, Josefina1 Sociometrics Corporation, Los Altos, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463028684?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this research was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of the Abstinence and Contraception Education Storehouse (ACES), a digital, classroom-based resource designed to supplement existing sex education curricula with highly interactive materials such as video clips, multimedia polls and quizzes, and audiovisual demonstrations. Three hundred thirty-five students aged 14 to 19 were randomly assigned to an ACES-based (treatment) or a standard (control) sex education curriculum. Data were collected at the onset of the intervention and 3 months after the completion of the intervention. Preliminary results were highly encouraging, with ACES participants who were sexually initiated at baseline reporting (at the 3-month follow-up) significant reductions in the number of times they had sex in the past 4 weeks. Both sexually initiated and non-sexually initiated youth who experienced the ACES curriculum also demonstrated greater intent to abstain from the sex during the follow-up period than did those in the control group. Adapted from the source document.

Effects of an Undergraduate HIV/AIDS Course on Students' HIV Risk

Author: Marsiglia, Flavio F1; Jacobs, Bertram L; Nieri, Tanya; Smith, Scott J; Salamone, Damien; Booth, Jaime1 School of Social Work, Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center, Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona, USA marsiglia@asu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463025757?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, the authors use a quasi-experimental pretest and post-test survey design to examine the effects of a course, called HIV/AIDS: Science, Behavior, and Society, on undergraduate students' HIV knowledge, attitudes, and risky sexual behaviors. With the assistance of social work faculty, the course incorporates experiential learning pedagogy and a transdisciplinary perspective. Although the course was not designed as a prevention program, the theory of health behavior suggests the incorporation of experiential learning will impact crucial HIV/AIDS attitudes and behaviors. When regression models were applied, relative to the comparison group (N = 111), the HIV/AIDS class students (N = 79) reported an increase in post-test HIV knowledge, perceived susceptibility to HIV among females, and a reduction of risky sexual attitudes among sexually active students.

Abstract: The current study was conducted to examine the impact of mixing genders in intervention groups targeted toward HIV-positive men and women. The gender composition of groups in a randomized clinical control trial was examined in relation to participant group attendance and group satisfaction measures. The regression model for men in the risk reduction condition was significant; however, the model was not significant for women in the same condition. The findings indicate that mixing genders in this intervention had no negative impact on women's group satisfaction and may have positively impacted men's group satisfaction. In practice, mixed-gender intervention groups can be a helpful option for delivering programs to diverse populations, especially when resources are limited within community-based organizations. Although more thorough investigation is needed, this study supports the idea that mixing genders may be a viable option in practice. Adapted from the source document.

Examining the Role of Relationships, Body Image, Closeness to HIV/AIDS, and HIV Optimism in the Sexual Risks of Young Men Who Have Sex With Men

Author: Callander, Denton1; Senn, Charlene1 Department of Psychology, University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1463026173?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, the authors examined the effects of HIV optimism, closeness to someone with HIV/AIDS, self-esteem, and body image on sexual risk behavior of men who have sex with men (MSM) who reached sexual maturity after the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Online survey responses from 139 sexually active male participants were considered as a whole and for the subpopulation of males not in steady, monogamous relationships. Knowing someone with HIV/AIDS was related to lower levels of sexual risk taking. The aspect of body image related to weight was also an important factor in safer sex behavior, with perceptions of heavier bodies related to higher sexual risk taking. For single participants only, higher HIV optimism was related to greater sexual risk taking although likely as a function of retrospective justification. The findings from this unique exploratory study of young MSM are discussed in the context of implications for policy around current and future health campaigns. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Community-based HIV/AIDS prevention interventions have become popular forms of preventive healthcare initiatives in the past several years. The authors examined the development of a new community-based HIV/AIDS prevention intervention and its impact on participants' HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, condom-use intentions, sexual behavior, and HIV testing status. Results indicated that the intervention had a significant impact regarding increased HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, decreased instances of unprotected sex, and increased likelihood of getting tested for HIV. Policy implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This cross-sectional survey study is an analysis of the combined effects of contextual and personal factors in socialization, meeting of sexual partners, and sexual risk-taking among 529 young gay, bisexual, and other young men who have sex with men (ages 13-29 years). Results of binary logistic regression indicated that (a) the majority of the participants socialized outside of their home neighborhoods; (b) 13- to 20-year-olds utilized social circles to meet casual sex partners significantly more than 21- to 29-year-olds, who were more likely to make use of mainstream gay venues for this purpose; and (c) the participants who met sex partners at mainstream gay venues were less likely to engage in unprotected anal sex than those who partnered via the Internet. Adapted from the source document.

HIV-Related Stigma as a Mediator of the Relation Between Multiple-Minority Status and Mental Health Burden in an Aging HIV-Positive Population

Author: Storholm, Erik David1; Halkitis, Perry N; Kupprat, Sandra A; Hampton, Melvin C; Palamar, Joseph J; Brennan-Ing, Mark; Karpiak, Stephen1 Center for Health, Identity, Behavior & Prevention Studies, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, New York University, New York, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448997731?accountid=14925

Abstract: Cross-sectional analyses of 904 diverse men and women aged 50 years and older living with HIV in New York City were conducted to examine the unique experiences and needs of aging HIV-positive individuals. Using Minority Stress Theory and Syndemic Theory as guiding paradigms, the authors documented the mental health burdens of the sample with regard to depression, loneliness, and diminished psychological well-being and examined how multiple-minority status and HIV-related stigma explained these burdens. Mediation modeling demonstrated that the effects of minority stressors on mental health burden were mediated by HIV-related stigma. The mediation was significant for the overall sample and for the male subsample. Results suggest that to fully address the mental health burdens experienced by aging HIV-positive individuals, we must continue to address mental health burdens directly, and at the same time, look beyond the psychiatric symptoms to address the structural inequities faced by individuals based on their multiple-minority status.

Heavy Marijuana Use Among Gay and Bisexual Male Emerging Adults Living With HIV/AIDS

Author: Bruce, Douglas1; Harper, Gary W; Fernandez, M Isabel1 Master of Public Health Program, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois, USA dbruce1@depaul.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448999084?accountid=14925

Abstract: Marijuana use has been documented to be higher among emerging adults than among other age groups in the United States. Persons living with HIV may use marijuana as a method for alleviating symptoms and side effects associated with treatment as well as a coping or mood adjustment strategy. The authors analyzed data from a two-phase mixed methods study of young HIV-positive gay/bisexual men to explore motivations for heavy marijuana use. Phase I consisted of semistructured qualitative interviews with 54 young gay/bisexual HIV-positive men (mean age 21.0 years) conducted at four geographically and demographically diverse sites. Phase II consisted of a computer-assisted quantitative survey administered to 200 young gay/bisexual HIV-positive men (mean age 21.1 years) across 14 clinical sites within the ATN. Phase I participants described marijuana use chiefly within the contexts of responses to initial HIV diagnosis, stress relief, and relaxation, including active and avoidant coping techniques. Phase II results revealed that almost one-quarter (23%) of the sample reported smoking marijuana every day, and another 16% said they smoked at least weekly but not daily. Logistic regression analysis determined significant predictors of at least weekly marijuana use to be using substances to relieve the stress of living with HIV (Beta = 1.04, p < .01), using substances alone (Beta = 2.05, p < .01), and using substances to reduce side effects of medication (Beta = 2.44, p < .01). Heavy marijuana use in our quantitative sample greatly exceeded rates reported in population-based studies of emerging adults and in previous studies of medicinal marijuana among persons living with HIV. These data have implications for self-care strategies among young persons living with HIV and intervention development for this population. Adapted from the source document.

Foundation for the Future: Meeting the Psychosocial Needs of Children Living With HIV in South Africa and Uganda

Author: McCleary-Sills, Jennifer1; Kanesathasan, Anjala; Brakarsh, Jonathan; Vujovic, Marnie; Dlamini, Kgethi; Namisango, Eve; Nasaba, Rose; Fritz, Katherine; Wong, Vincent J; Bowsky, Sara1 International Center for Research on Women, Washington, DC, USA

Abstract: Successes in diagnosing and treating pediatric HIV have necessitated care that extends beyond basic medical needs. However, capacity for providing childhood psychosocial support (PSS) remains limited. Programmatic research with young PLHIV, care providers and parents in Uganda and South Africa explored challenges in meeting the psychosocial needs of HIV-positive children. Three areas for childhood PSS were examined: disclosure, stigma, and grief/bereavement. This research identified programming gaps, strategies and good practices in five focal areas: providing immediate postdiagnosis support, stigma reduction, capacity building, addressing grief, and promoting peer support. Recommendations are presented for enhancing PSS for HIV-positive children in resource-limited settings. Adapted from the source document.

An Assessment of a Home-Based Program for Children Orphaned by HIV/AIDS in Cameroon Africa

Author: Ndzibidtu, Denis Bambo1; Meyer, Dorothy J; Tih, Pius M1 Cameroon Baptist Convention Chosen Children Program, Nso, North West Region, Cameroon, Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448999129?accountid=14925

Abstract: More than four-fifths of all children orphaned by AIDS worldwide live in Sub-Saharan Africa. In response to the growing number of orphans, governments, civil society, and international organizations have implemented programs to provide protection, care, and support to these children. However, few of these programs have assessed their effectiveness. The Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Service Chosen Children Program provides home-based services, which include HIV screening, payment of school fees and medical care, nutritional assistance, psychosocial support and counseling, and monitoring through home visitation. Quantitative and qualitative data are provided that show that orphans served by the Chosen Children's Program stayed within their family homes, were in school longer, and achieved more school success than did orphans not receiving services.

Exploring HIV-Related Stigma in Kerala, India

Author: James, Maria1; Mignone, Javier; Roger, Kerstin; Halli, Shiva1 Department of Family Social Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448999214?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand whether HIV-positive persons experience stigma in relation to HIV/AIDS and how it has impacted their lives and that of their families. Ethnographic techniques were used to collect data from Kerala, India. The findings were organized into three themes: (a) physical appearance and HIV-related stigma; (b) the "informed" and the "ignorant": knowledge and ignorance in the context of HIV/AIDS; and (c) immorality as a perceived cause of HIV infection and the family context. The study highlighted the need to develop a more nuanced understanding of HIV-related stigma that extends beyond the current conceptualization of stigma. Adapted from the source document.

"They don't even greet you": HIV Stigma and Diagnosis Disclosure Experienced by HIV-Positive African Immigrants and Refugees in New Zealand

Author: Poindexter, Cynthia Cannon1; Henrickson, Mark; Fouche, Christa; Brown, Derek; Scott, Kay1 Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service, West Harrison, New York, USA poindexter@fordham.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1448997853?accountid=14925

Abstract: Due to recent changes in New Zealand's HIV and immigration situations, there is a growing need to understand the lives of HIV-positive African newcomers there, including how and when they encounter HIV stigma and discrimination. To illuminate the experience of these individuals, interviews with 13 African immigrants or refugees in New Zealand described difficulties with and causes of HIV stigma and decisions about disclosure of HIV diagnosis. The continued presence of stigma suggests that more work must be done on HIV education, privacy enforcement, antistigma campaigns, culturally competent care, and enforcement of existing human rights laws. Adapted from the source document.

Correlates of Adherence Among Rural Indian Women Living With HIV/AIDS

Author: Nyamathi, Adeline1; Salem, Benissa; Ernst, E J; Keenan, Colleen; Suresh, P; Sinha, Sanjeev; Ganguly, Kalyan; Ramakrishnan, Padma; Liu, Yihang1 School of Nursing, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996161?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, correlates of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) were assessed using a baseline questionnaire among 68 rural women living with AIDS (WLA) in India. Unadjusted analyses revealed positive relationships of ART adherence with Hindu religion and support from spouses and parents, whereas negative associations were found with depression, poor quality of life, and having 10 or more HIV symptoms. Multiple linear regression analysis also revealed that WLA who were Hindu, not depressed, had ART support from spouses and parents, and perceived some benefit from ART, were more adherent to ART than their respective counterparts. This study reveals the unique challenges which rural WLA experience and the need to mitigate these challenges early in ART treatment. Further, the findings enable the refinement of an intervention program that will focus on strengthening ART adherence among rural WLA. Adapted from the source document.

Effect of Perceived Stigma on Adherence to Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy and Self-Confidence to Take Medication Correctly in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

Author: Tilahun, Hibret A1; Mariam, Damen Haile; Tsui, Amy O1 Addis Ababa University, School of Public Health, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541999829?accountid=14925

Abstract: Stigma has been a major barrier to accessing HIV prevention, care, and treatment services. This study seeks to assess the effect of stigma on self-reported adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and self-confidence to take medication correctly among HIV-infected adults in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A descriptive cross-sectional study using both quantitative and qualitative data was carried out at Zewditu Memorial Hospital's HAART clinic. Self-reported Morisky scale was used to assess adherence to HAART, and Berger stigma scale was used to measure the level of perceived stigma. The three measures of stigma (negative self-image, concern about public attitude, and concern about disclosure) were negatively associated with self-reported adherence to HAART and with self-confidence to take medication correctly. In order to improve adherence, programs that address stigma need to be designed and implemented. Adapted from the source document.

Financial Hardship and Life Satisfaction Among Aging African Americans With HIV

Author: Longmire-Avital, Buffie1; Golub, Sarit A; Parsons, Jeffrey T; Brennan-Ing, Mark; Karpiak, Stephen E1 Department of Psychology, Elon University, Elon, North Carolina, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996121?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research on older HIV-positive (HIV+) adults finds that minorities with HIV are less educated and report less stable incomes than whites with HIV and the general population. This study assesses to what extent perceived financial hardships contributes to life satisfaction for HIV+aging African Americans. Participants were 377 African American HIV+individuals over age 50 (35% women) living in New York City. A three-step hierarchical linear regression analysis indicated that perceived financial strain for aging HIV+African Americans is a significant and independent predictor of life satisfaction (p < .001). Outreach to African Americans aging with HIV should consider how financial strain is associated with life satisfaction. Outreach should also address systemic economic disparities for African American communities that have high infection rates and a greater number of people living with HIV; these communities face a burden towards accessing effective health care and preventative care that is partially driven by limited economic resources. Adapted from the source document.

Social and Clinical Determinants Influencing HIV Treatment Among Hoosiers

Author: Hillman, Daniel1; Carelock, Brittney; Tobias, Jodi; Connor, Michael; Roseberry, Jeremy; Lofton, Stephanie; Carnicom, Lois1 Indiana State Department of Health, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA dhillman@isdh.in.gov

Abstract: Indiana, with an estimated 9,282 persons living with HIV/AIDS in 2008, was selected to participate in the Medical Monitoring Project. The Medical Monitoring Project is a surveillance system designed to generate representative data on persons living with HIV/AIDS who are receiving care in Indiana. The authors sought to answer: What obstacles exist today among persons receiving HIV medical care? What impact do these have on treatment and services? Of 451 participants sampled, 349 reported at least one service need during the past year and 164 (47.0%) of those participants reported at least one service need was unmet. Overall, reported unmet needs was significantly associated (p < .034) with a lower likelihood of 'always' taking HIV medications. The study results indicate that obstacles to treatment adherence involve unmet needs commonly found among HIV-infected persons receiving care. Interventions to improve treatment adherence involve community service assessments, client awareness, linkage to services, and provider awareness of existing barriers. Adapted from the source document.

Reaching Haitian Americans Living With HIV/AIDS: Met and Unmet Health Care Needs

Author: DeRigne, LeaAnne1; Choi, Jung Jin; Barsky, Allan E; Albertini, Velmarie1 School of Social Work, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida, USA lderigne@fau.edu

Abstract: While HIV shows no discrimination, the Haitian American community is overrepresented among groups affected by HIV/AIDS and yet remains underserved in health care and social services. The purpose of this study is to explore the met and unmet health care needs of Haitian Americans living with HIV/AIDS. This study reports the findings of an in-depth qualitative study that explored the experiences of 150 Haitian Americans infected with or affected by HIV. Findings indicated misinformation on HIV/AIDS, distrust for service providers among the participants, stigma impacts health-seeking behavior, and a need for providing culturally informed services. To ensure that Haitian Americans living with HIV/AIDS access appropriate services, health care providers need to ensure their programs and staff address cultural attitudes, beliefs, and expectations. In particular, clinicians should demonstrate respect; provide confidentiality and privacy, and address language barriers, transportation needs, housing, and family needs. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to describe patient perceptions of two different electronic personal health records for patients living with HIV/AIDS in New York City. Seven focus groups were conducted with a total of 54 patient participants. Focus group participants anticipated benefits including increased patient responsibility, health awareness, efficiency, security, and provider benefits (e.g., time savings). Concerns and barriers related to password recall, computer access, and computer literacy. Future research efforts are needed to further delineate the personal health records features and functions necessary to meet the complex health care, social service, and self-management needs of low-income populations of patients living with HIV/AIDS, design effective strategies to overcome barriers to personal health records use, and evaluate the impact of personal health records use on patient empowerment, shared decision making, and HIV-related patient outcomes.

A Survey of HIV/AIDS Counselors in Botswana: Satisfaction With Training and Supervision, Self-Perceived Effectiveness and Reactions to Counseling HIV-Positive Clients

Author: Stockton, Rex1; Paul, Tebatso; Morran, D Keith; Yebei, Philemon K; Chang, Seok-Hwan; Voils-Levenda, Amanda1 Counseling and Educational Psychology, Indiana University Bloomington, Bloomington, Indiana, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997505?accountid=14925

Abstract: A total of 181 HIV/AIDS counselors in Botswana, Africa, were surveyed about their satisfaction with their training and supervision, self-perceived clinical effectiveness as counselors, social stigma encountered, emotional and psychological reactions to counseling HIV-positive clients, and barriers to effective counseling. The majority of HIV/AIDS counselors indicated satisfaction with the quality of the training received, perceived themselves as effective counselors, were relatively untroubled by social stigma issues, and perceived few barriers to effective counseling. A large percentage of the counselors received 8 weeks or less of formal training, generally received little or no in-service supervision, and experienced stress and burnout. Many counselors also felt that they had too many clients to be effective and that they had inadequate access to learning materials. Recommendations included the need to provide regular and clinical in-service training experiences, training for clinical supervision, and the development of uniform counseling standards. Adapted from the source document.

Withdrawal Symptoms Hindering Harm-Minimization and Drug Detoxification Efforts: Experiences of Injecting Drug Users in Nepal

Abstract: In this study, the authors explored the perception and strategies used by 20 injecting drug users (IDUs) as they regularly confront life-threatening complications stemming from their drug use. The 20 IDUs were from four urban centers of Nepal: Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara, Narayanghaat, and Hetauda. The phenomenological study was conducted, using individual in-depth interviews ranging from 1 to 2 hours in length. All data were analyzed using the analytical approaches of grounded theory. It was found that the urgency and severity of withdrawal symptoms are the major precursors, leading drug users to share unsterile syringes and needles and thereby increasing the risks of HIV transmission and other health risks. The study also found that IDUs seemed aware and worried about HIV and other health risks, prompting them to devise their own seemingly suitable strategies for harm minimization. Understanding these high-risk strategies should inform public health and intensive harm-reduction services to be considered and implemented in Nepal. Attempts should be made to keep the IDUs in touch with suitable medication-assisted therapies to overcome the withdrawal symptoms, thus minimizing the chance of sharing syringes/needles with other IDUs.

Abstract: Data collected from 224 women living with HIV were analyzed to study quality of life. Quality of life was operationalized as mental health and physical functioning. A structural equation model was tested. The final model demonstrates good fit to data (X2 = 17.63, p = .48). Mental health was directly and positively associated with being born outside of Canada, social support, and physical functioning but negatively associated with the proportion of people aware of serostatus and experienced discrimination. Physical functioning was directly and positively associated with being born outside of Canada and social support; however, it was negatively associated with time since diagnosis. The proportion of people aware of serostatus was negatively associated with being born outside of Canada and being a mother. Social work interventions aimed at improving quality of life in women living with HIV should target contexts of serostatus disclosure to minimize HIV discrimination and to improve social support sources without compromising existing ones. Adapted from the source document.

The Co-Occurrence of Mental Illness and High HIV Risk in a Sample of African American MSM: Findings and Implications

Author: Loue, Sana1; Daugherty-Brownrigg, Brittany; Heaphy, Emily; Mendez, Nancy; Sajatovic, Martha1 Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997492?accountid=14925

Abstract: African American men who have sex with men often experience rejection and discrimination. Mental illness may contribute to high HIV risk behavior. We assessed the relationship between mental illness and HIV risk among African American men who have sex with men. We assessed 125 African American men who have sex with men aged 18 years or older in Ohio for mental illness, substance use, HIV knowledge, and risk. Bivariate analyses were conducted. Any mental illness was associated with substance abuse (p = .001), child abuse (p = .032), suicide attempts (p = .028), and trading sex for money or drugs (p = .002). Bipolar disorder was associated with trading sex for money or drugs (p = .008). Mood disorders appear undertreated among African American men who have sex with men. More adequate mental health and substance abuse treatment are needed both in the prison system and the community setting to reduce HIV risk and transmission. Adapted from the source document.

Complementing the Sense-Making Approach With a Survey to Enhance Communication of HIV/AIDS Knowledge

Author: Major, Lesa Hatley1; Coleman, Renita1 School of Journalism, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA lhmajor@indiana.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996363?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, metropolitan area, in a tie with Miami, Florida, the second highest for new cases of AIDS per capita in the nation. This study uses the Baton Rouge case to suggest improvements to sense-making theory. It posits that complementing sense-making's traditional qualitative approach with quantitative analyses will improve long-term community-based health-promotion campaigns by uncovering HIV/AIDS knowledge gaps that exist between groups and within individuals about their own risk for the disease. As the results show, many similarities were indeed found, but some differences also emerged. This triangulation approach is important in creating health communication messages that are effective with the entire population. Adapted from the source document.

Comparative Analysis of Health Care Expenditures and Presence of Mental Health Conditions of HIV-Affected Versus Non-HIV-Affected Children

Author: Ganguli, Arijit1; Gourley, Dick; White-Means, Shelley1 Division of Health Outcomes & Policy Research, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA arijit.gangs@gmail.com

Abstract: As HIV/AIDS mortality rates improve, more and more HIV-infected parent(s) are bearing HIV-negative children. Using a comprehensive national medical cost data, this study compared the health care expenditures (prescription and nonprescription) of HIV-affected and non-HIV-affected children, with a special focus on the impact of mental health conditions on expenditures. Post matching, multivariate analysis showed the HIV-affected children's prescription expenditures are significantly less compared to non-HIV-affected children. However, HIV-affected children with mental health conditions incurred greater: total health care expenditures (4.0 times), nonprescription health care expenditures (3.1 times), and prescription expenditures (8.7 times) compared to the respective expenditures of other children in the study.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine which factors derived from an adapted version of the Health Belief Model are associated with HIV testing among women at domestic violence shelters in the rural south (N = 112). Participants were administered self-report questionnaires to assess for test acceptance and were offered private and free HIV rapid testing. A logistic regression analysis was performed. Results indicated that higher perceived susceptibility and higher posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms predicted a greater likelihood of HIV test acceptance. The most common reason given for not testing was a lack of time. Implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Governing the Geographies of the Nongovernmental Organization Sector: Analyzing Coverage Challenges in the HIV/AIDS Campaign in Malawi

Abstract: A successful program response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic requires the targeting of high-risk groups. However, when HIV prevalence is high throughout the population-as it is in Malawi-the need exists to cover the entire country. The authors examine the ability of the Malawi program to achieve national coverage. A major obstacle is that very few civil society groups, which are the main implementation agents, factor coverage into their programming. Rather than expanding their coverage, they extend their activities within their traditional catchment area to serve as many people as possible. Thus, it is necessary to clarify the division of labor between government and civil society, so that together they can respond in a coverage-sensitive manner. Adapted from the source document.

Does Powerlessness Explain Elevated HIV Risk Among Tajik Labor Migrants? An Ethnographic Study

Author: Luo, Jing1; Weine, Stevan; Bahromov, Mahbat; Golobof, Alexandra1 Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541999923?accountid=14925

Abstract: To investigate the role of powerlessness in elevated HIV risk among labor migrants, we compared internal verses external male migrant workers from Tajikistan using minimally structured interviews and focused field observations. The sample included 30 male labor migrants who traveled to work in Regar, Tajikistan (internal labor migrants), and 30 who travelled to work in Moscow, Russia (external labor migrants). Though powerlessness did not appear to account for whether labor migrants engaged in more HIV risk behaviors, the harsh living and working conditions of external labor migration impacted how the migrants manifested these HIV risks by amplifying group masculine norms and behaviors. Progress in preventing HIV infection amid the difficult social conditions of labor migration is contingent upon adequate conceptualization of how such conditions impact HIV risk behaviors.

Low Condom Use Among Adolescent Female Sex Workers in Thailand

Author: Moraros, John1; Buckingham, Robert W; Bird, Yelena; Prapasiri, Surasri; Graboski-Bauer, Ashley1 School of Public Health, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada john.moraros@usask.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996263?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Thailand, it is estimated that there are nearly 2 million female sex workers (FSWs), of whom 800,000 (40%) are under the age of 18 years. Studies examining condom use among adolescent FSWs in Thailand have been limited. Therefore, a survey was administered to a cross-sectional, nonrandomized sample of convenience among 130 adolescent, brothel-based FSWs in four geographic areas of Thailand. A condom utilization gap was evident in the present study, since on average adolescent FSWs used 3.8 condoms per day, while seeing 7.4 patrons per day. This is especially troubling since generalized condom utilization campaigns in the past have overlooked adolescent FSWs. Consequently, future public health efforts in Thailand need to recognize the existence and identify the unique healthcare needs of this vulnerable population, if they are to successfully decrease their sexually transmitted infection/HIV incidence rates.

'These girls gave me AIDS. Why should I use condoms?' Clients of Sex Workers in Kamathipura Express Their Attitudes About HIV

Author: Karandikar, Sharvari1; Gezinski, Lindsay B1 College of Social Work, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541999822?accountid=14925

Abstract: Very little research has been conducted that examines the attitudes toward HIV/AIDS from the perspective of clients of sex workers. This study examined 13 male clients of sex workers through in-depth interviews that aimed to explore their understanding of risks associated with unprotected sex, as well as condom use and attitudes about condoms and HIV/AIDS. The findings suggested that clients of sex workers often have incorrect knowledge about HIV/AIDS. Additionally, differences arose around condom use with sex workers versus intimate partners. Finally, participants were found to deceive sex partners and intimate partners about their HIV/AIDS status. These findings emphasize the importance of more effective HIV/AIDS awareness programming aimed at male clients of sex workers. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring the Role of Community-Based Peer Support in Improving Access to Care and Antiretroviral Treatment for Sex Workers in Mysore, India

Author: Lazarus, Lisa1; Reza-Paul, Sushena; Pasha, Akram; Jairam, Seema; Hafeez Ur Rahman, Syed; O'Neil, John; Lorway, Robert1 Faculty of Health Sciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1542000035?accountid=14925

Abstract: To meet the HIV prevention needs of sex workers in India, some community-based organizations have begun integrating peer education and community mobilization into community-led structural interventions. As the role of community-based organizations continues to expand into new service areas, it is important to understand how these new interventions are received. This agency assessment was done in collaboration with Ashodaya Samithi in 2009. Ashodaya Samithi is a community-based organization led by female, male, and transgendered sex workers. In the past year, HIV-positive sex workers of Ashodaya have registered their own organization, known as Ashraya. Based on qualitative findings, this study describes how community-based organizations can play an important role in improving access to care and antiretroviral treatment for sex workers. The rapid growth of Ashraya and its success at fostering social solidarity and large-scale structural interventions hold valuable lessons for community-based organizations and public health practitioners working in the field of HIV/AIDS.

The Extent and Nature of Fluidity in Typologies of Female Sex Work in Southern India: Implications for HIV Prevention Programs

Author: Jain, Anrudh K1; Saggurti, Niranjan1 Population Council, New York, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996030?accountid=14925

Abstract: These authors examine the nature and extent of fluidity in defining the typology of female sex work based on the place of solicitation or place of sex or both places together, and whether sex workers belonging to a particular typology are at increased risk of HIV in southern India. Data are drawn from a cross-sectional survey conducted during 2007-2008 among mobile female sex workers (N = 5301) in four Indian states. Findings from this study address an important policy issue: Should programmatic prevention interventions be spread to cover all places of sex work or be focused on a few places that cover a large majority of sex workers? Results indicate that most female sex workers, including those who are usually hard to reach such as those who are mobile or who use homes for soliciting clients or sex, can be reached programmatically multiple times by concentrating on a smaller number of categories, such as street-, lodge-, and brothel-based sex workers.

Long-Term HIV/AIDS Survivors: Coping Strategies and Challenges

Author: Stowers Johansen, Pamela1; Kohli, Hermeet1 School of Social Work, California State University-Chico, Chico, California, USA

Abstract: The purpose of this qualitative study was to develop a clearer understanding of the challenges and needs of long-term HIV/AIDS survivors living in rural and semirural areas, as well as to explore what factors and resources may be related to more effective coping. Eleven long-term HIV/AIDS survivors were invited to participate in this research through an AIDS service organization working in rural/semirural California towns. Each participant was interviewed using structured questions. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Spirituality, having a sense of control, and social support were associated with more positive perceptions. Perceiving life as 'better' or 'worse' seemed unrelated to prediagnostic functioning for the majority of the participants. Coping seemed to have more to do with individual reactions than to actual life circumstances, health, or financial status. Interestingly, some of the most ill with the most limited incomes expressed the most optimistic perceptions of their lives. Similarly, while it was expected that persons living in rural areas would have more difficulties, the majority of our participants did not seem to perceive living in rural or semirural areas as barriers to services. A surprising finding was the number of participants who noted the stigma of disability related poverty as being more important than the stigma of having HIV/AIDS, being a homosexual, or having a mental illness.

Abstract: HIV-infected individuals experience high rates of mental health difficulties. This study examines archival chart data of HIV-infected individuals (N = 94; 54% African American) 2 years after initiating specialized psychiatric services (psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or both) to (a) characterize demographic correlates of medical outcomes; (b) describe factors associated with continued psychiatric care at 2 years; and (c) compare medical outcomes for those who continued in psychiatric care and those who did not. Results indicated that there was higher emergency department use and medical hospitalizations among women, ethnic minorities, and heterosexual patients over 2 years. Physicians reported greater adherence problems among minority patients and unemployed individuals. Patients with a history of sexual or physical abuse and individuals with psychotic disorder diagnoses were more likely to remain in psychiatric treatment. Current psychotropic medication use was associated with (a) fewer comorbid health conditions; (b) use of more medications; (c) greater use of HIV medications; (d) fewer physician concerns about medication adherence; (e) lower frequency of an AIDS diagnosis; and (f) less frequent occurrence of a detectable viral load. While there were few differences between those who remained in specialized care and those who did not, patients who continued in treatment had fewer comorbid health conditions at 2 years. In summary, findings suggest differential health outcomes based on demographic characteristics and psychotropic medication use with few differences associated with continued specialized psychiatric care. Future research should seek to further examine mechanisms associated with the impact of ongoing psychiatric care on longitudinal medical outcomes among HIV-infected individuals.

Personalized Stigma and Disclosure Concerns Among HIV-Infected Immigrant and Indigenous HIV-Infected Persons in the Netherlands

Abstract: This study examines stigmatization among immigrant and indigenous (a person whose parents were both born in the Netherlands) HIV-infected patients in the Netherlands. We interviewed 90 indigenous Dutch and 112 immigrant HIV-infected patients using the personalized stigma and disclosure concerns subscales of the HIV Stigma Scale. Use of these scales with HIV-infected immigrant patients was feasible as we found adequate reliability and patients were able to answer the questions after explanation. Personalized stigma was significantly higher among HIV-infected immigrants. Disclosure concerns were significantly higher among persons with an HIV transmission route other than men having sex with men. In multivariate analyses adjusting for age, sex, and number of years being HIV positive, having an immigrant status remained significantly associated with personalized stigma and HIV transmission routes other than men having sex with men remained significantly associated with having more disclosure concerns. Our findings suggest that social workers and counselors should be especially attentive to experienced and perceived HIV stigma among HIV-infected persons from these particular populations. Future studies should explore the mechanisms underlying stigmatization in the different subgroups so interventions to decrease stigmatization can be developed and examined.

From Burial Societies to Mutual Aid Organizations: The Role of Idirs-Traditional Burial Societies in Ethiopia-In Ensuring Community-Level Care and Protection of Vulnerable Children

Author: Stuer, Francesca1; Ogojo Okello, Francis; Wube, Medhanit; Steinitz, Lucy Y1 Family Health International-Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia f_stuer@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541997536?accountid=14925

Abstract: From 2004 through 2009, Family Health International engaged 270 Idirs-traditional burial societies-in Ethiopia's fight against HIV and AIDS, which required the Idirs to change from only supporting death and mourning ceremonies to also supporting the living via mutual aid. Results show that more than 126,000 children received services and that these Idirs played a catalytic role in changing local attitudes away from discrimination and stigmatization and toward direct support for orphans, other vulnerable children, and people living with or affected by HIV infection. The achievements further demonstrate that, when capacitated, indigenous community-level organizations can become major partners in achieving lasting, transformational development at the grassroots level.

What HIV/AIDS Case Management Approaches Bring About Positive Client Outcomes? Results from ConnectHIV

Author: Rogers, Susan J1; Corcoran, Caitlin L; Hamdallah, Myriam; Little, Stacey1 FHI 360, C-Change, New York, New York, USA srogers@fhi360.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1541996090?accountid=14925

Abstract: ConnectHIV was a public-private partnership between the Pfizer Foundation and 20 AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs) in 10 high prevalence states. Five of the ASOs, funded to link persons living with HIV into high quality care and treatment services, used a case management (CM) approach. The ASOs utilized various strategies in their CM interventions which were conducted in diverse organizations and geographic areas. An outcome evaluation was conducted that used a repeated measures design collecting data at baseline and at two follow-ups-either 2 or 3 months and again at 6 months. Results showed that the clients who participated in CM interventions made significant positive changes across the five outcomes (knowledge of HIV disease management, medical adherence, viral load, CD4 count, and perceived health) from either baseline to the first follow-up and/or the second follow-up. Results also showed that clients at certain ASOs made significantly stronger gains than those in others which plausibly could be attributed to the use of certain CM strategies as well as organizational factors. More multisite research needs to be conducted on HIV/AIDS case management to identify the most effective strategies and contextual factors that can bring about positive client outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

Barriers and Facilitators to Providing HIV-Related Services in Bostonian African American Churches: A Focus Group Study of Clergy and Community Members

Author: Teti, Michelle1; Drainoni, Mari-Lynn; Raj, Anita; Cozier, Yvette C; Harris, Cynthia; Bright, Donna; Welles, Seth L1 School of Health Professions, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283643854?accountid=14925

Abstract: African American churches are potential sites of culturally relevant HIV prevention and service provision. A coalition including an ecumenical group of Christian clergy and lay leaders in the African American church community, a minority AIDS service organization, and an academic medical center, was funded to develop faith-based HIV education, prevention, and testing services. Before service implementation, coalition leaders conducted six focus groups with 46 different religious leaders and community members at risk for or living with HIV/AIDS, to understand program needs and collaboration strategies. Study participants identified key barriers and facilitators that are critical to the success of faith-based HIV/AIDS services. Adapted from the source document.

Application of the Need and Asset Model to Church-Based HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control

Author: Aja, Godwin N1; Lee, Jerry W; Modeste, Naomi N; Montgomery, Susanne B; Belliard, Juan C1 Department of Public Health, Babcock University School of Public and Allied Health, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State, Nigeria

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283643875?accountid=14925

Abstract: The recent global focus on the promotion of faith-based health and social interventions requires two major empirical data sets: (a), an understanding of how the health needs of churches relate to the assets they hold and (b) the collective capacity of members to use needed resources to help address a wide range of health issues including HIV/AIDS that continue to challenge many African countries' already limited health-related resources. In this study, we hypothesized that if Nigerian churches have less stated perceived needs in relation to more perceived assets that could be used for HIV/AIDS prevention and control, they would have greater collective efficacy and engage in more HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities. Estimates of churches' perceived needs, assets, collective efficacy, and activities as reported by church members from 81 Nigerian churches were aggregated. The linear regression method was used to test if needs and assets predicted collective efficacy and HIV/AIDS activities. The sum of church needs was positively related to collective efficacy.

Civic Participation and Risky Sexual Behavior Among Urban U.S. Men Who Have Sex with Men

Author: Muriuki, Andrew M1; Fendrich, Michael; Pollack, Lance M; Lippert, Adam M1 Center for Addiction and Behavioral Health Research, Helen Bader School of Social Welfare, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA

Abstract: Drawing on the social capital literature, we hypothesized that civic engagement, as measured by participation in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender-related community activities, would be an important protective factor with respect to sexual risk behavior. Accordingly, we examined the association between participation and three measures of risky sexual behavior in a group of men who have sex with men (MSM) who were part of the four-city, 1996-1998 Urban Men's Health Study. In these analyses, we used the subsample of adult MSM who reported same-gender sex in the past year and were not HIV positive (N = 1857). Compared to those reporting no civic participation, those with the lowest and highest levels of participation were no more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior, but those with the second highest level had an increased likelihood of risky sexual behavior. Abstention from drugs, having a male primary partner, higher income, a college degree, and being older than 29 years of age all reduced the odds of risky sexual behavior among MSM.

Aboriginal Youth Experiences of Accessing HIV Care and Treatment

Author: Prentice, Tracey1; Mill, Judy; Archibald, Chris P; Sommerfeldt, Susan; Worthington, Catherine; Jackson, Randy; Wong, Tom1 Institute of Population Health, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/1283643877?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this community-based research was to examine the experiences of Canadian Aboriginal youth regarding accessing HIV testing and care services. We used a mixed method exploratory research design; 413 participants completed a self-administered survey and 25 youth participated in in-depth semistructured interviews. Findings reported here are from the 26 survey participants (12.4%) and nine interview participants (28.9%) who self-reported being positive for HIV. Results of this study suggest that some Aboriginal youth do not test for HIV until late in the course of their disease, and once diagnosed, a significant number of youth delay accessing care. Support from friends, family, and others is an important motivator for youth to initiate care and treatment. Integrated, comprehensive, youth-friendly, and culturally safe services are important to keep youth in care. Adapted from the source document.

Patterns of Treatment Use and Barriers to Care Among Hospitalized Adults with HIV

Author: Cavaleri, Mary A1; Elwyn, Laura; Pilgrim, Alicene; London, Karyn; Indyk, Debbie; Jackson, Jerrold; McKay, Mary M1 Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA

Abstract: This study explores utilization of treatment for HIV and barriers to care among 22 low-income adults of color who were hospitalized at an urban medical center in New York City. A semistructured interview assessing use of medical care and adherence to HIV medications, psychosocial stressors (e.g., social support, substance abuse, and mental health need), and logistical, perceptual, and environmental barriers to treatment was administered during the participants' hospital stay. Results showed that most of the sample had a regular source of outpatient care; however, very few were consistently connected to services. Further, the majority of respondents either skipped dosages or was not taking HIV medications all together. Untreated mental health and substance abuse difficulties, competing needs (e.g., housing, economic), unsafe living environments, negative views of treatment, and lack of social support were cited as contributing to treatment underuse. These findings suggest highly disadvantaged populations face innumerable obstacles to consistent receipt of needed care: implications and potential methods to intervene are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Thirty Years into the HIV Epidemic: Social Work Perspectives and Prospects

Author: Linsk, Nathan L11 Jane Addams College of Social Work, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904291?accountid=14925

Abstract: June 5, 2011 marked the thirtieth anniversary of the publication of the first case reports of HIV among gay men in San Francisco and Los Angeles, generally the point in time agreed upon as the start of the epidemic. From the start, social workers made key contributions along with other health providers in developing knowledge and services to help those affected and infected and avoid future infections. HIV social work contains all of the challenges and satisfactions entailed throughout the social work profession due to the wide array of activities we perform as social workers -- case management, other forms of direct clinical practice, supervision of social workers, professionals and para-professionals, empowerment practice, program development, engaging stakeholders, participation in policy setting, and advocacy of every type, stripe and category. Adapted from the source document.

Development of an HIV/STD Screening Index to Measure HIV/STD Risk in Adolescents

Author: Jarama, S Lisbeth1; Stultz, Natalie A; Parillo, Kathleen M; Snyder, Frederick R; Young, Paul A1 NOVA Research Company, Bethesda, Maryland, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904294?accountid=14925

Abstract: The development of an adolescent screening assessing risk of exposure to HIV/sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and its psychometric evaluation is described. An initial set of 31 items was administered to 1418 adolescents. Item and factor analyses resulted in an 18-item HIV/STD risk screening index. Reliability analysis indicated favorable evidence for index internal consistency (alpha = .86) and temporal stability over 6 to 10 days (r = .92). Construct validity was supported by the ability to use the index to differentiate between groups that differed in history of HIV/STD. Convergent validity was evidenced by significant correlations of the index with conceptually related measures. The screening index shows favorable psychometric evidence among diverse samples of adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Recruitment and retention of participants remain a challenge to the implementation of behavioral HIV prevention programs. The aim of this article is to describe the process and challenges encountered while recruiting and retaining participants in the SISTA South Africa study in particular and to provide an understanding of the barriers to participation in a behavioral HIV prevention program among black HIV-negative women in general. Focus group discussions were conducted with HIV-negative women in three peri-urban townships in the Western Cape Province. The main barriers to participation were competing economic activities and domestic chores, the assumption that HIV prevention programs are mainly for HIV-positive women, HIV stigma, and uncertainties about HIV prevention programs. This study highlights advantages and pitfalls of recruiting from voluntary counseling and testing clinics and provides information for the development of meta-interventions to improve program participation. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: To reverse increasing rates of HIV among African American women, intervention strategies need to be informed by their perceptions of HIV and HIV risk, and their recommendations for enhancing current interventions. In this focus group study, a community sample of African American women (n = 26) was asked to speak to these topics. Researchers conducted content analyses of focus group transcripts using Freire's conscientization theory and Rosenstock's Health Belief Model to articulate common themes from participants' responses. Findings indicate that most participants were well-informed about their risk for contracting HIV, but saw more barriers than benefits in engaging in preventive health behaviors, and believed that their health, like the integrity of their environment, was largely beyond their control. Participants also saw an urgent need to step up intervention efforts with younger women, whom they believed were at high risk for contracting HIV. Discussion includes implications for policy and practice. Adapted from the source document.

Set the P.A.C.E.!: Results of an HIV Prevention Intervention for Mothers of Young Children

Abstract: The purpose of the study was to test the efficacy of an HIV prevention intervention to encourage effective parenting and communication between mothers and their 6- to 12-year-old children. The overall goal of the program was to involve mothers in HIV prevention efforts for their children. Three hundred six predominantly African American mothers and their children participated. Mothers attending the intervention were more likely to discuss sexuality-related topics and to state that they intended to discuss sexuality issues with their children at younger ages than did mothers in the control group. The study demonstrates that providing mothers with information and skills can increase their awareness of the need to provide age-appropriate sexuality education to their children, including specific information about HIV and its health consequences, and to encourage their children to adopt behaviors that reduce their chances of contracting HIV.

Advancing HIV Prevention Among Multiethnic Vulnerable Youths: Ethnoracial and Gender Differences

Author: Blanco, Estela1; Lindsay, Suzanne; Lemus, Hector; Ojeda, Norma; Zuniga, Maria Luisa1 Department of Pediatrics, Division of Child Development and Community Health, University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904306?accountid=14925

Abstract: The need for the evaluation of community-based HIV prevention interventions among at-risk ethnoracial minority youth is warranted. A 5-day peer-led intervention was conducted among 201 at-risk youth aged 12 to 22 years old. We assessed ethnoracial and gender differences in sexual health knowledge, intention and ability to practice safe sex pre and post intervention. Participants were 57% male with a mean age of 16 years (50% Latino, 28% white, and 22% black). While participants in all ethnoracial groups showed improvement post intervention, black participants improved significantly less than whites in their intention to use condoms and HIV knowledge. Differences varied by baseline response. Results indicated that interventions may need enhancement in order to have a greater impact on ethnoracial minority youth. Adapted from the source document.

Identifying Locus of Control Dimensions Related to HIV/AIDS Risk Among South African Students

Author: Gwandure, Calvin1; Mayekiso, Thokozile1 School of Human and Community Development, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/919904309?accountid=14925

Abstract: The aim of the study was to identify significant correlates of HIV-related risk behaviors using locus of control-based dimensions such as self-control, deferment of gratification, personal values, and social alienation. Participants in this study were university students who volunteered to participate in the study. The authors used correlations and linear regression to analyze the relationships between locus of control-based variables and HIV/AIDS risk. The results of the study found significant correlations between the locus of control-based variables and HIV/AIDS risk. Regression analysis indicated that the locus of control-based model, for example, deferment of gratification and personal values and expectancies explained a significant proportion of the variance in HIV/AIDS risk. Directions for future research could focus on locus of control-based models in predicting HIV/AIDS risk among individuals in diverse population groupings. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Introduction to journal issue. This compilation of articles from across three continents highlights the unique HIV prevention challenges and successes across multiple settings. More important, in true ecological form, they highlight how micro- and macro-level factors may all interestingly influence antiretroviral treatment adherence. Furthermore, they emphasize the importance of soliciting the perspectives of service providers, community stakeholders, and service recipients when attempting to reduce HIV sequelae and remove barriers to effective care. These articles are a powerful reminder to us that we are all linked in the global fight against HIV/AIDS. Adapted from the source document.

Causal Beliefs and Treatment Preferences for the Symptoms of Depression Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS

Author: Noel, La Tonya1; Pomeroy, Elizabeth C1 College of Social Work, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896164530?accountid=14925

Abstract: The focus of the research study was to explore chronically ill African American, Latino, and White patients' causal attributions for symptoms of depression and factors that may impact depression care treatment preferences among these groups. With a community sample of African Americans, Latinos, and White HIV-positive adults receiving services in central Austin, Texas, a binary logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between causal beliefs and predictor variables and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between treatment and provider preferences for the symptoms of depression and ethnicity. Differences were found across race/ethnicity with regard to treatment preferences and patterns of causal beliefs were associated with treatment preferences among HIV-positive participants. Adapted from the source document.

Keeping At-Risk Persons Living with HIV/AIDS in Care: A Qualitative Study of Staff Perspectives

Author: Rajabiun, Serena1; Coleman, Sharon; Drainoni, Mari-Lynn1 Health & Disability Working Group, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896186922?accountid=14925

Abstract: Engaging and retaining persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in medical care is essential to ensure disease management and successful health outcomes. This article summarizes the results of a qualitative study of 21 staff members from seven programs aimed to engage and retain at-risk PLWHA in HIV medical care. The data revealed five domains of services provided and skills delivered: 1. finding people, 2. delivering services and practical support, 3. assistance with systems navigation and linking to services, 4. providing HIV education and information, and 5. relationship-building. These activities were implemented within a framework of client-centered care and teamwork. These findings can assist program planners and service providers with approaches to enhance staff skills that lead to better quality and service delivery for at-risk PLWHA individuals. Adapted from the source document.

Self-Reported Satisfaction with HIV Services Including the AIDS Drug Assistance Program

Author: Frank, Linda Rose1; Lochab, Anupama; Dada-Jones, Yasmin; Folby, John; Pease, Joseph; Korman, David; Gupta, Ashish1 Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896186941?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this study, we sought to obtain data from HIV/AIDS patients served in Pennsylvania's AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) in 2005, to obtain input pertaining to the access, utilization, and quality of HIV treatment. Self-reported data through a survey instrument were solicited from all 2912 adults actively enrolled in the Pennsylvania ADAP in 2005. Of the enrollees who responded, 59% reported undetectable viral load, 71% reported CD4 counts of greater than 200 cells/mm3, and 80% reported ease in accessing medical care providers. A positive relationship with clinicians was reported by 93% of respondents, 77% were compliant with treatment, and 87% received timely standard of care.

Integrated Care of Orphans and Vulnerable Children in Ekondo Titi and Isangele Health Areas of Cameroon

Author: Nsagha, Dickson Shey1; Thompson, Rosetta Bola1 Department of Public Health and Hygiene, Medicine Program, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Buea, Buea, Cameroon

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896186958?accountid=14925

Abstract: For orphans and vulnerable children in Cameroon, HIV/AIDS impacts child survival, growth, and development. The objective of this study was to identify and census orphans and vulnerable children and determine their medical, educational, nutritional, housing, employment, and legal needs. A participative approach involving public and traditional authorities consisted of a door-to-door search of orphans and vulnerable children from village to village in the Ekondo Titi and Isangele Health Areas using eight trained interviewers and a local guide. A standardized questionnaire and vulnerability scale were used to identify these children and their needs. Field supervision and validation were carried out by the social workers of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Through the survey, 581 orphans and vulnerable children were identified. It was found that many of these children lack birth certificates, most (90.5%) with health problems and 55 (9.3%) with HIV infection. Few have three meals a day. Most of them attend school. About half live with foster families and about one-third of these families need income-generating activities to support these children. There is a critical need for the provision of basic education, birth certificates, medical treatment, and nutritional needs for the orphans and vulnerable children in Cameroon. Adapted from the source document.

Investigating the Role of Media Advocacy in Framing Accessibility of Antiretroviral Treatment in Ethiopia: A Social Work Perspective on Communication Theories

Author: Tafesse, Moges11 School of Social Work, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896186981?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Ethiopia a range of factors endanger accessibility of antiretroviral treatment (ART) by persons living with HIV/AIDS. The objective of this study is to investigate challenges and best practices of media advocacy and message framing endeavors of ART stakeholders to address ART accessibility. The study used survey and key-informants interviews with ART stakeholders (N=53). The findings of the study indicated that there is a significant information gap regarding ART among the public. The study concluded that the fragmented and confusing media messages can be corrected using a systems approach for future ART scale-up endeavors. Adapted from the source document.

Food Insecurity and Nutritional Barriers to Antiretroviral Therapy: Lessons from Latin America and the Caribbean

Author: Martin, Alexis1; Palar, Kartika; Pitkin Derose, Kathryn; Adams, Jayne1 The World Food Program, Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, Panama City, Panama

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/896164525?accountid=14925

Abstract: Poor nutrition and food insecurity are emerging as important barriers to antiretroviral therapy access and adherence in low-resource settings, yet little is known about these barriers in Latin America and Caribbean. This qualitative study used community expert interviews to explore the links between food insecurity, undernutrition, and HIV/AIDS treatment in the region. Results indicate that food insecurity and undernutrition are closely linked to quality of life, health status, and access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy in the region. Social services, such as food assistance and nutrition counseling, and access to social protection networks are needed for people with HIV infection who are economically vulnerable so that the full advantages of antiretroviral therapy can be realized.

New HIV Prevention Technologies? Implications for Us in Social Services

Author: Linsk, Nathan L

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/870998826?accountid=14925

Abstract: As the twenty-ninth year of the HIV/AIDS epidemic draws to a close, there are a number of hopeful developments based on emerging science and technology, yet the underlying social and environmental issues that characterize HIV prevention and living with HIV remain. As has been the case from the beginning, the distinctive mix of scientific inquiry and advancement, the continuing march forward of the epidemic and the disproportionate impact on vulnerable and marginal populations make HIV/AIDS work a particular challenge for social service and health providers dedicated to helping those most in need.

Are Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills Linked with HIV-Related Sexual Risk Among Young Men Who Have Sex with Men?

Author: Fisher, Colleen M11 School of Social Work, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/870998828?accountid=14925

Abstract: Young men who have sex with men are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, yet relatively little is known about the most effective theoretical frameworks for preventive interventions with this population. This study investigated the fit of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model for predicting sexual risk among a sample of ethnically diverse young men who have sex with men aged 14 to 21. Path analysis results indicated that the IMB model predicted a moderate amount of variance in primary and secondary sexual risk for young men who have sex with men (r2=.26 and .21, respectively). Fit of this model was acceptable on most indicators of model fit for primary and secondary risk. Adapted from the source document.

Trait Self-Enhancement, Immune Markers, and Risk-Reduction Behaviors in HIV-Positive Gay Men

Author: Stein, Traci R1; Bonanno, George A; Gershefski, Patricia Anthony1 Department of Counseling & Clinical Psychology, Clinical Psychology Program, Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/870998833?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over the past few decades, a relationship has emerged between intrapsychic factors and health outcomes in HIV-positive and other populations. We examined whether trait self-enhancement would correlate with immune markers and sexual risk taking in a sample of 54 asymptomatic HIV-positive gay men, most of whom were ethnic minorities. Participants completed a one-time assessment with regard to self-enhancement, psychological distress, and sexual risk taking, and provided consent to access information regarding immune status and other health-related variables. Both self-enhancement and minority status were significantly associated with CD4 counts, but the latter effect disappeared when looking at only white and African American participants. Neither factor was related to viral load, sexual risk taking, or psychological distress. More research with larger and more diverse samples is needed to further elucidate the possible salutary relationship between self-enhancement and critical medical and behavioral outcomes in this population. Adapted from the source document.

HIV/AIDS Knowledge and Prevention Programming in Domestic Violence Shelters: How Are We Doing?

Author: Rountree, Michele A1; Goldbach, Jeremy; Bent-Goodley, Tricia; Bagwell, Meredith1 School of Social Work, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/870998597?accountid=14925

Abstract: Domestic violence shelters (n=59) in two southwestern states were surveyed about their services related to HIV prevention. Variables included organizational characteristics, agency protocols and practices, HIV/AIDS prevention programming, staffs' HIV/AIDS knowledge, and staffs' attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS prevention for women exposed to intimate partner violence. In this exploratory, descriptive study results indicated that most shelters had a significant awareness of how HIV/AIDS is transmitted, but few shelters offered testing (17%) or sexual safety planning (20%). Results also showed that eighty-one percent of respondents believe that HIV/AIDS educational prevention programs could be effective in protecting abused women from contracting HIV/AIDS. However, less than half (46%) of the respondents reported that they disseminate HIV/AIDS information to all women in the shelter. Adapted from the source document.

Improving Effectiveness for Support Groups for Males with HIV/AIDS: Feedback from Leaders and Potential Participants

Author: Rogers, Traci Brenner1; Mapp, Susan C1 Pressley Ridge, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/870998836?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate methods to improve support groups for men with HIV/AIDS as barriers have been noted to full utilization. A multimodal study was conducted to accomplish this. Two different survey methods were used: an anonymous survey of 25 potential members and 5 semistructured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of potential members. Three leaders of successful groups for this population were also interviewed via telephone. The facilitators and barriers to group attendance were assessed as well the desired focus for such a group. Results determined that while the majority of respondents wanted a group, educational groups were more desired than support groups and stigma continued to be a barrier to attendance.

Catch 22: Women with HIV on Wisconsin's Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) Program: A Qualitative Narrative Analysis

Author: Keigher, Sharon M1; Stevens, Patricia E1 Helen Bader School of Social Welfare, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/870998604?accountid=14925

Abstract: In 1996 when Congress eliminated the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, it was the largest income source of women living with HIV in the United States. In its place, Congress created a new federal block grant, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), to fund state-run compulsory workfare programs. To learn how welfare reform affected HIV-positive women, this qualitative narrative analysis examines the experiences of nine seropositive women enrolled in Wisconsin's TANF program, Wisconsin Works, between 2000 and 2003. Repeated in-depth interviews over 24 months explored participants' efforts to secure health care, income, and social services. This article analyzes the verbatim transcripts of those in-depth qualitative interviews. Constrained by the double stigma of HIV/AIDS and welfare, with Wisconsin Works Program incomes below half the poverty level, their families lived intermittently on Wisconsin Works income, rent assistance, food assistance, Medicaid, and sometimes child support. Between illness and benefit disruptions, these mostly long-term HIV survivors described feeling exhausted, angry, and demoralized, struggling daily for respect against the system's bureaucratic disentitlements. Adapted from the source document.

A Test of the Job Demands-Resources Model with HIV/AIDS Volunteers

Author: Cox, Stephen1; Pakenham, Kenneth I; Cole, Sally1 Faculty of Business, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

Abstract: Burnout has been identified as a significant factor in HIV/AIDS volunteering. It has been associated with depression, anxiety, and the loss of volunteers from the health care delivery system. The aim of this study was to test the independence of the health and motivational processes hypothesized within the Job Demands-Resources model of burnout in HIV/AIDS volunteers. Participants were 307 HIV/AIDS volunteers from state AIDS Councils throughout Australia who completed self-report measures pertaining to role ambiguity and role conflict, social support, burnout, intrinsic and organizational satisfaction, and depression. Findings suggested that the independence of the dual processes hypothesized by the model was only partially supported. These findings provide a model for burnout that gives a framework for interventions at both the individual and organizational levels, which would contribute to the prevention of burnout, depression, and job dissatisfaction in HIV/AIDS volunteers. Adapted from the source document.

Health Care Providers' Reports of Perceived Stigma Associated with HIV and AIDS in Rural and Urban Communities

Author: Brems, Christiane1; Johnson, Mark E; Warner, Teddy D; Roberts, Laura Weiss1 Center for Behavioral Health Research and Services, University of Alaska Anchorage, Anchorage, Alaska, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/853219842?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over 1,500 rural and urban providers in Alaska and New Mexico responded to our survey assessing their perceptions of stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. Findings indicated that providers perceive HIV/AIDS as highly stigmatized and stigmatized more than other physical and mental illnesses. Perceptions of HIV/AIDS stigma varied across community sizes, with highest levels in rural communities and lower levels in urban, small urban, and small rural communities. Across communities, behavioral health care providers reported perceptions of greater stigma associated with HIV, AIDS, and other illnesses than did physical health care providers. Increased stigma in rural communities exacerbates health care disparities faced by rural residents and underscores the need for research on reducing stigma associated with HIV/AIDS. Adapted from the source document.

HIV Peer Education: Relationships Between Adolescents' HIV/AIDS Knowledge and Self-Efficacy

Author: Mahat, Ganga1; Scoloveno, Mary Ann1 College of Nursing, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/853219682?accountid=14925

Abstract: School-based programs have been found to be effective in limiting sexual risk behaviors among adolescents. A peer-led educational program is one of the school-based approaches used to educate and empower adolescents toward healthy behaviors. The purposes of this study were to determine the effectiveness of a peer education program on improving adolescents' HIV/AIDS knowledge and self-efficacy for limiting sexual risk behaviors and also to determine the influence of self-efficacy on adolescents' HIV knowledge. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the peer education program. The results of the study demonstrated that HIV knowledge and self-efficacy improved significantly postintervention. Since children spend a considerable time in school, more school-based programs need to be developed to promote information on risk behaviors and prevention. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: A community-based participatory research study was conducted using focus groups with 39 women living with AIDS (WLA) in the rural setting of Andhra Pradesh, India. In addition, three nurses, two physicians, and five reproductive health accredited social health activists (ASHAs) took part in focus groups. The WLA offered insight into the benefits of HIV-trained ASHAs including emotional support, assistance with travel to health care providers and antiretroviral therapy medication adherence. Health care providers also identified benefits of using HIV-trained ASHAs and suggested modalities for how to train these individuals. These findings will contribute to the design of a future program of care involving HIV-trained ASHAs. Adapted from the source document.

The Influences of Stress and Social Support on Adherence to Health Promotion Strategies by People Living with HIV/AIDS in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania

Author: Kaijagea, Theresa1; Wexler, Sandra1 Institute of Social Work, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764418268?accountid=14925

Abstract: In Tanzania, about 7% of the adult population is HIV-infected. Given limited pharmaceutical options, adherence to strategies that foster health and well-being is vital to reducing both new and repeated HIV exposure. We investigated the influences of HIV/AIDS-related stress and social support on adherence to health promotion strategies by people living with HIV/AIDS in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In-person interviews were conducted with 212 individuals who were clients of local AIDS service organizations. Regression analyses indicated that HIV-associated stress had a direct, negative effect on adherence, decreasing the practice of health-maintaining behaviors and increasing engagement in sexual risk behaviors. Informal social support moderated the relationship between stress and sexual risk but did not buffer the impact of stress on health-enhancing behaviors. No moderation effect was found for formal social support. The implications of our findings for social work and public health practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: A growing number of people living with HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia today are relocating to holy water sites, in search of spiritual care. This article documents the experiences of 17 people living with HIV/AIDS, based on their in-depth interviews by the author. The use of holy water is considered by them to be an alternative and complementary treatment for HIV/AIDS. In addition, there are some other spiritual practices that can be considered spiritual treatment. The issue of using antiretroviral treatment together with holy water treatment remains controversial among the research participants. The article shows areas of intervention for social workers regarding the people living with HIV/AIDS who are heading to holy water sites for relief.

'Boundaries of Sexual Safety': Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) and HIV/AIDS in Addis Ababa

Author: Tadelea, Getnet11 Department of Sociology, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764418164?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is a growing literature on African sexuality that established the presence of homosexuality in about 50 African societies, although widespread public and religious discourse claims homosexuality does not occur in Africa. This article draws from 24 in-depth interviews and one focus group discussion with men who have sex with men (MSM) in Addis Ababa, within a societal context where homosexuality is illegal. The results revealed that there is some degree of misinformation among the MSM who believe that HIV/AIDS can only be transmitted through heterosexual sex. Thus, MSM seemed to be vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and other STIs because of unprotected anal sex, which they believed to be safe. The findings highlight that current efforts aimed at preventing the spread of HIV are not reaching some high-risk behaviors. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at preventing the spread of HIV could benefit from addressing different types of sexual practices and identities. Otherwise, a significant unacknowledged transmission route of HIV may hamper all other public health campaigns against HIV transmission in Ethiopia and make the cost of such campaigns needlessly wasteful.

Author: Lentza, Corliss11 Department of Political Science, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764418264?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article examines the role of faith-based organizations (FBOs) in delivering HIV/AIDS services to the population of Zambia. It outlines the causes of HIV transmission, the development of community initiatives to provide services and education programs to underserved families and orphans affected by the disease, and activities of multinational organizations as they partner with FBOs to strengthen education programs, provide for orphans, deliver services, and develop community relationships. The paper suggests strategies for strengthening partnerships, identifies problems that affect the implementation of strategies, and makes recommendations for developing sustainable community relationships. Adapted from the source document.

The Orphans International Tanzania (OIT) Family Care Model: Strengthening Kinship Networks and Empowering Families

Author: Pardasani, Manoj1; Chazin, Robert; Fortinsky, Laura1 Graduate School of Social Service, Fordham University, New York, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/764417085?accountid=14925

Abstract: As the AIDS/HIV epidemic grows exponentially in Tanzania, the number of children who are orphaned due to this illness has increased in alarming proportions. Utilizing a preliminary exploration of a case study, this article explores a unique, collaborative, grassroots model of comprehensive community care. Orphans International Tanzania (OIT) operates a unique family preservation and support program, the Family Care Program, which aims to maintain orphaned children in home environments with access to education, basic medical care, and good nutrition. Incorporating a strategic international agency/community-based nongovernment organization partnership design and an internationally recognized family support model, comprehensive services are provided to children and their caregivers. This article provides information on impact of HIV/AIDS on Tanzania, illustrates the components of the program model, highlights critical community partnership development, and describes its influence on the children, their kinship caregivers and the community in general. Implications for replication in other communities impacted by HIV/AIDS are provided. Adapted from the source document.

Tribally-Driven HIV/AIDS Health Services Partnerships: Evidence-Based Meets Culture-Centered Interventions

Author: Duran, Bonnie1; Harrison, Melvin; Shurley, Maynard; Foley, Kevin; Morris, Priscilla; Davidson-Stroh, Lynn; Iralu, Jonathan; Jiang, Yizhou; Andrasik, Michele Peake1 School of Public Health, Department of Health Services, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA

Abstract: This paper describes a successful HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment project that combined medical, support, and educational services, thereby improving care in a rural American Indian tribe in the southwestern United States. Using the methods of community-based participatory evaluation and motivational interviewing, the 5-year, multiparty collaborative project improved health care access and medical regimen adherence of people with HIV/AIDS and increased the risk- and protective-factor knowledge of tribal members at high risk for the disease. The success of the collaborative in achieving all these goals highlights the importance of tribal control, collaboration, and incorporation of tradition and culture in HIV/AIDS diagnostic, treatment, and prevention efforts.

Psychosocial Stressors of Families Affected by HIV/AIDS: Implications for Social Work Practice

Author: Lichtenstein, Bronwen1; Sturdevant, Marsha S; Mujumdar, Anil A1 Department of Criminal Justice, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613397?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study identified the psychosocial stressors of low-income families who were affected by HIV/AIDS in Alabama. Methods consisted of personal interviews with 12 social workers at public agencies and a review of social work charts for 80 clients at an HIV clinic for mothers and children. The combined results indicated that families were likely to experience housing instability, family breakdown, mental illness, behavioral problems, and stigma. Younger children typically lived with their mothers, while older biological children often resided with relatives or in foster care. Social workers perceived mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety to be common among women caregivers. Behavioral problems and learning difficulties were frequently reported among children but children who were not living with HIV/AIDS did not have the same access to health care and social services as their siblings who were living with HIV/AIDS. This outcome is relevant to social workers because the children who were affected by HIV/AIDS outnumbered the children who were living with HIV/AIDS by a ratio of 3 to 1. Findings suggest that a model of care that involves funding for family-centered services for caregivers and children would provide a useful foundation for building stronger, more resilient families. Adapted from the source document.

Interpersonal Concordance in HIV-Affected Families Participating in a Structured Conflict Management Intervention

Author: Reich, Warren A1; Ahn, Eun K1 The Family Center, New York, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612345?accountid=14925

Abstract: A process model guided a qualitative study of a 10-week multifamily conflict management intervention, Family Pride. A central construct is interpersonal concordance, defined as the consensus within a family on their views of self and one another. Parent/caregivers and children described themselves and each other near the beginning and at the conclusion of this intervention. Hierarchical classes analysis (HICLAS) facilitated measurement of interpersonal concordance. A focused investigation of one family demonstrated a shift in their perceptions toward greater interpersonal concordance. Further analyses revealed a general shift toward more cooperative views of self and other family members, and toward greater interpersonal concordance. Adapted from the source document.

Spatial Disparity of HIV/AIDS Service Providers: The Case of Miami-Dade County

Author: Ganapati, Sukumar1; Ganapati, N Emel; De La Rosa, Mario; Rojas, Patria1 Department of Public Administration, Florida International University, Miami, Florida, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612527?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines the spatial disparity between the HIV/AIDS service providers and the HIV/AIDS patients. The empirical focus is on Miami-Dade, a large metropolitan county in the United States with a Latino population majority and a high AIDS incidence rate. This exploratory study contributes to the existing literature on geographical access to health providers. Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to examine the spatial disparity between the service providers and the patients. The study reveals that aggregate-level analysis masks the reality of the spatial disparity. Miami Dade County's Health Department focuses on aggregate zones for prioritizing its resources. At this level, there is little spatial disparity. However, evidence of spatial disparity emerges at the ZIP-code-level analysis. The major lesson from the study is that health policies need to be based on a finer-grained analysis to address spatial disparity. Adapted from the source document.

Does Social Capital Act as a Buffer Against HIV Risk Among Migrant Men in Sub-Saharan Africa?

Author: Sen, Soma1; Aguilar, Jemel P; Goldbach, Jeremy1 School of Social Work, San Jose State University, San Jose, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741613098?accountid=14925

Abstract: The 2007 World Bank data on HIV/AIDS for sub-Saharan Africa indicates that 22.5 million adults and children over 15 are living with HIV, including 1.7 million new infections. AIDS killed approximately 2.3 million people in the same year, making this region by far the worst affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This paper proposes a macro-level model for understanding the spread of disease within the context of migration. We use social capital theory to generate a framework for exploring how migration might serve as a conduit for the disease transmission. Specifically, we investigated male migrants in the Republic of Angola and argued that a migrant laborer's movement away from his village diminishes his social capital in terms of social support, norms, and networks while stresses from migration could prove to be conducive to the spread of the HIV virus. We use univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to explore the relationship between migration and HIV risk while considering social capital as the intervening factor. Social capital is conceptualized as a combination of social engagement, social support, and person-to-person contact. To this end, this study analyzes secondary data collected on a sample of migrants in Angola. Two hypotheses are tested: Migrants have lower social capital than nonmigrants and lower levels of social capital are related to higher risky behaviors. Results indicate that migrants have a lower level of social capital and migrants with lower social capital tended to have higher risky behavior. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612671?accountid=14925

Abstract: Within the Veterans Health Administration, substance use disorder clinics can be important locations for identifying HIV-infected patients. In this formative evaluation we assessed organizational readiness to implement a nurse-initiated HIV rapid test strategy in two Veterans Health Administration substance use disorder clinics. We conducted 34 quantitative surveys and 21 key informant interviews with front-line staff and management to assess attitudes regarding HIV testing in general and nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing specifically. We also assessed potential organizational impediments and facilitators to the implementation of nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing. Staff agreed that nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing is supported by research evidence, clinical experience, and patient need. Staff differed on the degree to which nurse-initiated HIV rapid test strategy fit within the substance use disorder clinic mission. We identified barriers to the implementation of nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing, including resource limitations, concerns of organizational readiness and patient acceptance of the nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing strategy. Despite these hurdles, the clinics are willing to adopt nurse-initiated HIV rapid testing if supported by appropriate modifications in organizational structure, HIV ordering policies, and specific changes in clinical practices. Adapted from the source document.

Provider Reports on the Ability to Implement Changes in Practice Following HIV-HCV Training

Author: Flores, Brian D1; Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean; Belden, Charles M; Barton, Betsy; Lombard, Frank1 Health Inequalities Program, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611454?accountid=14925

Abstract: The increased mortality among persons co-infected with HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C (HCV) is a concern that provider training on HCV-HIV co-infection may address. Medical and behavioral health providers were given training on co-infection. This study addresses two research questions: What changes, if any, did providers seek to effect in their practice after training? Of those providers desiring change in their practice, which, if any, did they implement? Surveys indicated that 82% planned to change their practice. Of those, 51% were reached 3 months later, and of those, 86% reported having enacted a change. Qualitative analysis found that planned changes fell into two domains: HCV Education and HCV Medical Actions. The most frequently intended and enacted changes involved patient education. Barriers to enact changes included lack of colleague support for HCV treatment and inadequate access to hepatitis A/B vaccine. Training on HIV-HCV co-infection should: engage multiple providers from the same site; address HCV treatment side effects; and support systems changes targeting vaccine and testing availability. Adapted from the source document.

Does Motivational Interviewing Stages of Change Increase Treatment Retention among Persons Who Are Alcohol and Other Drug Dependent and HIV Infected?

Author: Patterson, David A Silver Wolf (Adelv Unegv Waya)1; Buckingham, Stephan L1 School of Social Work, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611620?accountid=14925

Abstract: Motivational interviewing (MI) and stages of change are clinical and theoretical techniques receiving considerable attention in the alcohol and other drug treatment arena. An attempt was made to evaluate whether the theoretical perspectives behind MI and the transtheoretical stages of change model would increase treatment retention and completion with persons who are both alcohol and other drug dependent and HIV infected. A post-test design was used to test the potential of MI to increase the number of days in treatment and completion rates. Results showed that utilizing MI and the stages of change model did not increase the number of days in treatment, nor was there an increase in treatment completion. Findings suggest that those with multiple problems requiring an array of change stages to monitor may not benefit from this model. Adapted from the source document.

Associations among Violence Exposure, Mental Disorder, Substance Use Disorder, and HIV

Author: Sherba, R Thomas1; Singer, Mark I1 Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741611511?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study's primary aim was to provide co-occurring mental and substance use disorders (COD) prevalence data as well as additional epidemiologic data needed to more firmly establish violence exposure and COD as principally associated with HIV infection. Participants were clients assessed for alcohol and other drug treatment through the network of providers overseen by the Alcohol and Drug Addiction Services Board of Cuyahoga County (Ohio) from December 12, 2001 through July 18, 2007. Study design was a matched comparison of two groups of equal number (N = 638): HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected clients. The prevalence of COD with HIV infection was determined to be 26.3%. Through logistic regression modeling, both violence exposure and COD were found to be associated with HIV infection. Adapted from the source document.

HIV-Related Stigma, Discrimination, and Knowledge of Legal Rights among Infected Adults

Author: Fair, Cynthia D1; Ginsburg, Britten1 Department of Human Service Studies, Elon University, Elon, North Carolina, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/741612793?accountid=14925

Abstract: Literature on HIV-related stigma suggests that high levels of stigma are associated with poor medical adherence, depression, and decreased self-esteem. More recent research has focused on the acts of HIV-related discrimination experienced by infected individuals. However, little literature has explored the connection between perceptions of HIV-related stigma, discrimination, and knowledge of legal rights. Thirty-seven HIV-positive adults were surveyed regarding their experiences with HIV-related stigma and discrimination. Participants' knowledge of legal rights concerning HIV-related discrimination was also assessed. Personalized stigma was significantly correlated with reports of discrimination. Thirty-three percent of participants reported they had lost a job, and 25% reported they had to move because of their HIV status. Overall, the majority of participants were relatively informed about the legal rights of HIV-infected individuals. However, 21% believed that a restaurant could refuse to serve a person with HIV. Further analyses revealed that those participants who had high knowledge of legal rights scored significantly lower on the disclosure concerns subscale of the stigma scale and total number of acts of discrimination. Findings indicate the need for education concerning legal rights and that HIV-related stigma and discrimination are still a concern for infected individuals. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Housing has long been the single greatest area of unmet need for people living with HIV/AIDS, and there are few published descriptions of programs that address this need. This article describes Project New Hope in Los Angeles, California, a faith-based program that may be the nation's first housing program exclusively designed for people with HIV/AIDS. We discuss why housing is important for HIV-positive people; then we describe the project, including how it got started, how it operates, its linkage with the Episcopal Church, and its principal accomplishments and challenges. We conclude with lessons learned that might be applied elsewhere. Adapted from the source document.

Social and Behavioral Challenges of HIV Vaccines: Implications for Social Work and Social Science

Author: Newman, Peter A11 Factor-Inwentash Faculty Social Work, U Toronto, Ontario

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393656?accountid=14925

Abstract: A safe and efficacious HIV vaccine would be a tremendous asset to halting the spread of HIV. Nevertheless, HIV vaccines face a range of social and behavioral challenges that will determine their ultimate contribution to prevention. HIV vaccine development and clinical trials raise thorny social, behavioral, and ethical issues around resource allocation, recruitment and enrollment, trial implementation, and post-trial follow-up and access to services. Furthermore, the success of future HIV vaccines is contingent on access and acceptability. Involvement of social work and social service providers and engagement of social science research across the continuum of HIV vaccine development and dissemination are central to successful community engagement and advocacy, mitigation of social harms of clinical trials, support for fair and ethical conduct of trials, acceptability and access to future vaccines, and integration of HIV vaccines with behavioral HIV prevention. Adapted from the source document.

Associations Between HIV Risk, Unmitigated Communion, and Relationship Power Among African American Women

Author: Harris, Kanika A1; Gant, Larry M; Pitter, Renee; Brodie, Debra A1 School Public Health, U Michigan, Ann Arbor

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368105?accountid=14925

Abstract: Most new HIV infections among African American women are due to unprotected sex in heterosexual relationships. Women's scores on measures of relationship power and unmitigated communion (focus on others and exclusion of self) are associated with risky sexual behavior. We hypothesized African American women scoring low on relationship power and high on unmitigated communion would report greater risk for HIV infection. In a sample of 217 African American adult women, relationship power strongly correlated with HIV risk (p < .05), but unmitigated communion did not. Relationship power explained 40% of the variance in women's perceived HIV risk (^D*b = -.631, p = .000). Compared to their high relationship power counterparts, African American women with low to moderate levels of relationship power were 5 to 40 times less likely to successfully negotiate condom use and only reduced their HIV risk by 5% to 20% (compared to 80% to 95% improvements in risk reduction by their high relationship power counterparts). Adapted from the source document.

Author: Ardley, Jillian N1; Sileo, Thomas W1 Early Childhood Education, Mount Olive College, New Bern, NC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61393566?accountid=14925

Abstract: African Americans comprise one of the nation's largest ethnic communities. They also account for the highest number of HIV infection and AIDS cases among children, youth, and young adults across all racial, ethnic, and cultural populations. The purpose of this exploratory theory-based article is to discuss the extent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the African American community, variables that contribute to HIV/AIDS among African Americans, and culturally relevant program designs and instructional strategies that support African Americans' prevention needs and at the same time respect their cultural and family values. Adapted from the source document.

Street Youth in Toronto, Canada: An Investigation of Demographic Predictors of HIV Status Among Street Youth Who Access Preventive Health and Social Services

Author: Linton, Anthony B1; Singh, Mina D; Turbow, David; Legg, Timothy J1 Daphne Cockwell School Nursing, Ryerson U, Toronto, Ontario

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61348129?accountid=14925

Abstract: Street youth are increasingly at risk for HIV infection due to high-risk sexual behaviors and injection drug use. The purpose of this study was to assess the extent to which demographic characteristics of street youth in Toronto were predictive of HIV status. Age, gender, and ethnicity, education, length of time street-involved, and income were measured among a cross-sectional sample of 18- to 30-year-old street youth (N = 140). Results revealed statistically significant relationships between Age and HIV status (^D*b = 2.413, p < .001, OR = 11.169, 95.0% CI = 3.344-37.303), as well as Ethnicity and HIV status (^D*b = 2.051, p = .005, OR = 7.773, 95.0% CI = 1.836-32.900). Findings suggest that HIV prevention intervention programs may need to be refined or extended appropriately to older street youth in those 26-30 years of age, especially to meet the cultural needs of Black, Aboriginal, and other ethnic homeless youth populations. Further investigation of the duration of street involvement relating to HIV-risk-taking behaviors is necessary. Adapted from the source document.

HIV Prevention for Youths in Foster Care: Understanding Future Orientation and Intended Risk Behaviors

Author: Polgar, Michael1; Auslander, Wendy1 Dept Sociology, Pennsylvania State U, Hazleton

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61374602?accountid=14925

Abstract: Youths in foster care face challenges, including making healthy behavioral choices. Empirical data from a sample show how intentions to engage in HIV-risk behaviors vary among youths in foster care. Youths who hold safer attitudes about prevention and those who have fewer peers with behavioral problems more often intend safer behavior. Among young women, a stronger orientation toward the future is associated with fewer behavioral intentions that involve HIV risk. Youths in foster care who are in higher grades, express greater self-efficacy, or have fewer problems with mental health or substance abuse express a stronger and more hopeful orientation toward the future. These research results support the application of integrated health behavior theory among youths in foster care, showing that preventive attitudes, well-behaved peers, and a stronger orientation toward the future are associated with fewer behavioral intentions that precede HIV risk. Adapted from the source document.

HIV/AIDS Knowledge, Sexual Activity, and Safer Sex Practices Among Female Students in Hong Kong, Australia, and the United States

Author: Davis, Cindy1; Hughes, Lesley; Sloan, Melissa; Tang, Catherine; MacMaster, Samuel1 College Social Work, U Tennessee, Nashville

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398351?accountid=14925

Abstract: Early in the epidemic, HIV infection and AIDS were rarely diagnosed in women. Today, the HIV/AIDS epidemic represents a growing and persistent health threat to women, especially young women. The purpose of the current study was to conduct an international study with female undergraduate college students to assess knowledge and attitudes about HIV/AIDS, current and future sexual behaviors, and condom use self-efficacy. Participants included several convenience samples of female undergraduate college students from three public universities in the southern region of the United States (n = 112), a large public university in Australia (n = 66), and a public university in Hong Kong (n = 93). This research study utilizes a quantitative survey research design. Seventy-seven percent of American women and 66% of Australian women were sexually active compared with only 21% of Chinese women (^D*y2 = 67.74, p < .001). Of the sexually active women, 86% of Australian women reported regular use of safer sex practices during the past year compared with 69% of American women and 20% of Chinese women (^D*y2 = 8.9, p < .05). Although the sample as a whole scored generally high on HIV/AIDS awareness, it is not reflected in safe sex practices or intentions for future safe sex practices. Future studies should focus on further understanding the social, cultural, and psychological factors that hamper safe sex practices among this population as well as successful intervention strategies to overcome these barriers.

Abstract: Peer and health educators often facilitate interventions to increase safer sexual behavior among people living with HIV/AIDS. Absent from much of the HIV/AIDS prevention literature, however, is the impact of facilitation on interventionists and their needs while delivering safer sex interventions. These issues are particularly salient for peer interventionists who often share the HIV status and life challenges of intervention participants. In this article we present the clinical supervision strategy that we used, in which a social worker trained and supported peers and a health educator who delivered a safer sex intervention for HIV-positive women, as a case study with implications for future research and practice, to (1) identify the training, supervision, and emotional support needs of peers and health educators; (2) highlight the important role of clinical supervision in HIV prevention programming; and (3) share and promote the replication and testing of successful clinical supervision strategies.

Beyond Routine HIV Testing: Beliefs, Perceptions, and Experiences of Low-Income Women of Color

Author: Medina, Catherine K11 School of Social Work, University of Connecticut Puerto Rican/Latino Studies Project, West Hartford, Connecticut, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61361288?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this qualitative study, a social constructivist lens is used to examine the themes and meanings of HIV testing and prevention that emerge for 56 heterosexual African American and Latina women as shaped by their beliefs, perceptions, and experiences. The findings suggests a community and government multi-systemic approach that increases gender equality to talk about sexual health; information, education, and prevention programs with a gendered approach for their children; environmental safety -- protection from drugs, crime, and violence; and taking action by macro-level interventions that decrease the likelihood of the spread of HIV in communities of color.

Exploring the Relationship between Spirituality and HIV-Related Risk Factors among Young Black College Students

Author: Corbin, Dennis E1; Voisin, Dexter R; Snell, Cudore L1 Department of Social Work, California State University Dominguez Hills, Carson, California, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61371683?accountid=14925

Abstract: This exploratory study investigated the relationship between specific dimensions of spirituality and various HIV-related risk factors. A convenience sample of 95 young Black college students participated in the study. Primary measures assessed whether spirituality (i.e., prayer, a positive world view, and belief in the spirit world) was related to HIV self-efficacy and HIV-related risk factors (i.e., attitudes toward safer sex, peer norms endorsing safer sex, perceived susceptibility to HIV, substance use, intention to practice safer sex, and an expectation to practice safer sex). Regression findings indicated that higher levels of prayer were associated with greater HIV self-efficacy and a decreased perception of being at risk for contracting HIV. In addition, a positive world view was associated with greater peer norms endorsing safer sex. Findings indicated a direct relationship between specific components of spirituality and various HIV-related domains. Implications for social work research and practice are discussed in the context of these findings. Adapted from the source document.

Risk Factors, Knowledge, and Attitudes as Predictors of Intent to Use Condoms among Minority Female Adolescents Attending Family Planning Clinics

Author: Small, Eusebius1; Weinman, Maxine L; Buzi, Ruth S; Smith, Peggy B1 Graduate College of Social Work, University of Houston, Houston, Texas, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61392302?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine risk factors, knowledge, and attitudes as predictors of intent to use condoms among 290 minority female adolescents who attended family planning clinics. Data on demographic characteristics and risk behaviors such as drug use, school attendance, and contraceptive use were gathered. The results indicated that slightly over half of the teens intended to use condoms at the next intercourse. Overall knowledge about HIV/AIDS and STDs was poor and was not a predictor of intent to use condoms. Teens who intended to use condoms had more favorable attitudes about condom use and a better sense of self-protection regardless of partner feelings or beliefs. These findings suggest that program planners need to be aware that inconsistencies between knowledge and the behaviors of teens exist and this must be viewed within the teens' cultural milieu. Condom use and sex education should become a collaborative endeavor among teens, parents, and partners of female adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

Supporting Family Stability: Case Studies in Custody Planning with HIV-Affected Families

Author: Mason, Sally1; Vazquez, Deborah1 Institute for Juvenile Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61365860?accountid=14925

Abstract: Custody planning programs for HIV-infected parents help families overcome the obstacles to making future plans for their children in the event of the parent's debilitating illness or death. Using the family resiliency model, custody planning is viewed as a form of adaptation to illness which can reduce stress and uncertainty for children and parents. Case studies of four parents' participation in a custody planning program illustrate patterns that can inform service provision, including the role of social services in facilitating that process, while recognizing the uniqueness of each family's experience. As people with HIV are living longer, service needs have shifted to developing and maintaining family adaptation and stability, with custody planning as one component. Service providers with HIV-affected families must recognize the impact of low socioeconomic status on service access and use, with sensitivity to stigma, substance abuse, and mental health. Adapted from the source document.

African American Adolescent Females: Mother-Involved HIV Risk-Reduction Intervention

Author: Dancy, Barbara L1; Hsieh, Yu-Li; Crittenden, Kathleen S; Kennedy, Arlisha; Spencer, Bernel; Ashford, Daniell1 College of Nursing, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61366302?accountid=14925

Abstract: African American adolescent females continue to be at disproportionate high risk for HIV infection. A repeated measures quasi-experimental comparison group design compared an HIV risk-reduction intervention delivered by mothers with an HIV risk-reduction intervention delivered by health professionals and with a health promotion intervention delivered by mothers. The three interventions were randomly assigned to one of three geographical distinct sites. A convenience sample of 553 low-income African American adolescent girls with a baseline age of 11 to 14 years participated in the study. The results revealed that over a 6-month period, compared to girls in the health promotion intervention, the girls in the HIV risk-reduction interventions had significant higher scores on HIV transmission knowledge, condom attitudes, and self-efficacy to use condoms. The implication is mothers who receive appropriate training may be able to deliver HIV risk reduction to their daughters as well as health professionals. Adapted from the source document.

United States HIV Policy from the Human Rights Perspective

Author: Poindexter, Cynthia Cannon11 Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service, West Harrison, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61455647?accountid=14925

Abstract: HIV is not only a public health crisis, an economic crisis, and a social crisis; it is a human rights crisis. Yet in the United States, HIV has not been approached through a human rights perspective. In general, people with HIV or at risk for HIV have been treated as distrusted perpetrators, and access to needed services, information, and care have been selectively, not universally, available. Because the United States is globally influential in HIV funding and policies, our neglect and abuse of human rights have been exported. This paper uses the human rights lens to examine some of the ways in which the United States has traditionally approached the HIV pandemic and to critique those approaches, and suggests what HIV policy might be if universal human rights were considered. Adapted from the source document.

History of Violence as a Predictor of HIV Risk among Multiethnic, Urban Youth in the Southwest

Author: Marsiglia, Flavio Francisco1; Nieri, Tanya; Valdez, Elizabeth; Gurrola, Maria; Marrs, Catherine1 School of Social Work and Southwest Interdisciplinary Research Center, Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61423803?accountid=14925

Abstract: This community-based exploratory study examined the effects of a history of violence, ethnic identification, and acculturation status on HIV risk among a majority Latino sample of youth living in a large metropolitan area of the Southwest in the United States. The participants reported high rates of violence and attitudes that put them at risk for HIV/AIDS infection. They participated in one of two prevention interventions offered by a local non-governmental organization. The first intervention was tailored for adjudicated youth (N = 49) who were either institutionalized or returning to the community after involvement with the criminal justice system. The second intervention targeted youth (N = 32) who were homeless/runaway and/or self-identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender (GLBT). T-tests and linear regression were used to determine the differences between youth reporting a history of violence by type of perpetrator, its relationship with HIV risk, and the role of ethnic identification and acculturation status as potential protective factors. Violence by a family member was the most common type of violence reported, with a history of violence positively related to HIV risk. Ethnic identification and linguistic acculturation had a protective effect against HIV risk among the homeless and GLBT youth but not among the adjudicated youth. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Many HIV-infected individuals experience varying degrees of stigma on the basis of multiple aspects of their identity. Cultural competence for this population must address all of the ways that clients experience stigma, including not only race and ethnicity but also gender, economic status, sexual orientation, geography, drug use, and physical health status. This article reports on an evaluation study of a mental health program for people living with HIV/AIDS. Findings suggest that social service agencies need to be responsive to all aspects of a client's identity. Implications for practice with this multidimensional population are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Beliefs and Behaviors Regarding Substance Use and HIV Risk among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) in a Mid-Sized U.S. Community

Author: David A Patterson, Silver Wolf (Adelv unegv Waya)1; Hall, Martin; Golder, Seana1 School of Social Work, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, New York, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61426584?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores the beliefs and behaviors surrounding substance use and HIV risk among a convenience sample of 98 men who have sex with men (MSM) in a mid-sized community located in the central United States. Several interesting patterns were identified in the descriptive analyses. Multivariate analysis identified two variables--belief that recreational drug use made sexual experiences better and reports that most MSM friends drank alcohol or took recreational drugs--that were significant predictors of engagement in substance using behavior. Models accounted for 24% of the variance in drinking behavior and 15% of the variance in drug using behavior. Suggestions for HIV/AIDS prevention and intervention and implications for future research are given. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring HIV/AIDS Case Management and Client Quality of Life

Author: Pugh, Greg L11 School of Social Work, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422833?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite other investigations into the impact on the quality of life (QoL) of people living with HIV, the effects of HIV/AIDS case management services have not been directly investigated in the professional literature. A small HIV/AIDS case management program conducted an analysis of the services provided over a 6-month period with preassessments and postassessments of client QoL. A convenience sample of 78 clients completed the Multidimensional Quality of Life questionnaire for people with HIV. Demographics and QoL scores show expected relationships, such as higher QoL scores among clients with higher income, which are consistent with prior research. The study found significant relationships between elements of case management and specific domains of client QoL. Direct case manager interventions, such as counseling clients about coping with depression, had the strongest relationship with client QoL. Adapted from the source document.

Is It Just Me? Experiences of HIV-Related Stigma

Author: Block, R G11 Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, Oregon, USA blockr@ohsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61331615?accountid=14925

Abstract: HIV carries a significant social stigma, and people who are HIV positive and people who love and work with them may experience HIV-related stigma. The effects and magnitude of HIV-related stigma and stigmatizing behaviors are diverse. This qualitative study explored felt HIV-related stigma among adults with HIV including individual experiences and insight into the mechanism of HIV-related stigma. Participants shared experiences, and how they managed, coped and survived. Grounded theory analysis revealed that at the core of facing and managing stigma was living with HIV. Components of resilience -- risk factors, protective factors and coping skills -- were illustrated, and implicate further research. Adapted from the source document.

Building Bridges in Bridgeport for HIV-Positive Substance Abusers

Author: Wood, Starr A1; Austin, Sandra A1 School of Social Welfare, State University of New York, Albany, New York, USA sawood@albany.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61353004?accountid=14925

Abstract: Engagement and retention in treatment are important keys to adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for people living with HIV/AIDS. Engaging with HIV-positive substance abusers is particularly challenging because of their multiple needs. Although co-locating primary care, substance abuse, mental health, and support services are thought to be most effective for treatment, such programs can be difficult to implement. Collaboration and linkage between community service providers offer a good alternative method for reaching service integration. This article overviews the treatment integration needs of HIV-positive substance abusers and describes how one empirically selected social service program originated and continues to assist a community-based approach to care. Adapted from the source document.

Denver MSM Sociostructural Factors: Preliminary Findings of Perceived HIV Risk

Author: Natale, Anthony P11 School of Social Work, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, USA anatale@ou.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61371977?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative rapid ethnographic study identifies, describes and classifies the impact of sociostructural domains and their factors on men who have sex with men (MSM) HIV transmission risk. Included are the perceptions of HIV risk by four MSM subgroups: HIV positive, Latino, black, and young (aged 18 to 24). Results classify participant-perceived MSM transmission factors into sociostructural domains (e.g., social, health, economic, political, and mental health). Included in the article is a discussion of domain factors perceived as suitable for systemic intervention including addressing social stigma and discrimination, promoting MSM health and sexual health, and preventing and treating substance use. A review of study limitations and recommendations for future research conclude this article. Adapted from the source document.

Culturally Competent HIV/AIDS Prevention: Understanding Program Effects on Adolescent Beliefs, Attitudes, and Behaviors

Author: Lee, Junghee1; Donlan, William; Paz, Juan1 School of Social Work, Portland State University, Portland, Oregon, USA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61357417?accountid=14925

Abstract: Corazon de Aztlan is a comprehensive and culturally competent adolescent development program for Mexican American and other Hispanic youth intended to prevent risky sexual behavior. Perceptions of Corazon de Aztlan participants on condom use and their implications are presented. Evaluation of HIV/AIDS prevention program effects indicated the program increased accurate knowledge of safer sexual behavior, understanding of peer pressure, negotiation skills involved in having safer sex, sense of vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and abstinence from sexual activity, but not safer sex among those already sexually active. Contrasting rational decision-making and judgment theoretical models for understanding adolescent high-risk sexual behavior demonstrates the necessity of developing stronger partnerships between families, schools, and the larger community that could be instrumental in the creation of environments that would be more protective of youth. The potential benefits of using peer educator models and culturally competent sex education methods are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61347271?accountid=14925

Abstract: An adherence-focused case management intervention was evaluated in 84 public clinic patients in Los Angeles County, California, and included weekly contact with a paraprofessional case manager development of an individualized highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence support plan, and referrals to ancillary services. Participants were primarily Latino (65%) or African American (25%); male (74%); monolingual Spanish-speakers (57%) with annual incomes under $10,000 (65%). Participants were in the intervention for a median of 26 weeks; attended 67% of appointments; participated in an average of 9 hours of case management; and each visit averaged 23 minutes. Seventy-two percent of the goals established at baseline were achieved and 74% of referrals were completed. The most common goals were related to adherence (16%), housing (12%), or nutrition (12%). Self-reported adherence to HAART was no different for intervention participants compared to those in standard case management at 6 months. These data suggest that an adherence-focused case management program was effective in achieving established goals and referrals. In addition, the existing provider and standard case management adherence support appears sufficient to sustain adherence in this public clinic population. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Public health departments, correctional institutions, and community-based organizations (CBOs) are increasingly working together to improve and support the health of inmates returning to the community, especially those with HIV. CBOs, and particularly the staff of CBOs, are key in providing HIV services to transitioning inmates; however, little data are available to characterize these staff. The purpose of this qualitative assessment is to describe the experiences and motivations of frontline staff involved in HIV-related service delivery to inmates and ex-offenders participating in the CDC/HRSA Corrections Demonstration Project. Eight focus groups with a total of 64 participants were held during a National CBO Meeting with frontline staff. Content analysis focused on staff experiences, motivations, and definitions of client success. Staff draw on personal, educational, and professional experiences to do their jobs, and they are motivated by a desire to help clients. Individuals in social work with similar experiences may find a unique niche working with this population. In fact, individuals with a heightened sensitivity for inmates and ex-offenders may consider the fields of social work, nursing, counseling, community psychology, or public health to enhance their training and better serve this population. Additional findings emphasize the importance of acknowledging the small steps along the continuum of client success. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Sisters Informing Sisters about Topics on AIDS (SISTA) curriculum against an enhanced SISTA curriculum that included additional information about the relationship between drug use and HIV risk. The intervention aimed to reduce and prevent alcohol- and drug-related behaviors that negatively impact sexual decision making, such as having unprotected sex. It was hypothesized that the enhanced SISTA curriculum would lead to greater awareness of HIV risk and subsequently more consistent condom use. Participants were 260 young adult African American females, who identified as heterosexual. Measures of HIV knowledge and condom use were collected at pretest, posttest, and/or 3-month follow-up. The enhanced SISTA intervention demonstrated greater effectiveness than did the standard SISTA intervention in promoting HIV knowledge at posttest and subsequent condom use at 3-month follow-up. Implications for including drug education in HIV prevention efforts are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

HIV/AIDS Education in Harlem, New York: Needs and Recommendations

Author: Beckerman, N L1; Auerbach, Charles1 The Wurzweiler School of Social Work at Yeshiva University, New York, NY

Abstract: Although there have been national advances in HIV prevention, early detection of HIV, and early treatment of HIV, urban communities in the United States remain disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. Urban communities with populations over 500,000 in the United States account for 84.6% of cumulative AIDS cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2006). Certain communities in New York, such as Harlem and Washington Heights, are an example of an urban community that continues to experience disproportionately high HIV transmission rates (New York State Department of Health [NYS DOH], 2006). What are the unique sociocultural challenges that have obstructed recent HIV education efforts (CDC, 2006)? This article reports on the findings of a pilot study (n = 46) that sought to identify the sociocultural challenges to HIV education and prevention among clients at numerous inner city HIV/AIDS community-based organizations in New York City. Critical findings include why clients selected certain agencies (the locale) and what they thought was the most effective HIV education tool (accessible HIV/AIDS reading material). Adapted from the source document.

HIV Risk Behaviors among a Sample of Young Black College Women

Author: Alleyne, Binta11 Jane Addams College of Social Work, University of Illinois, Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61436495?accountid=14925

Abstract: Statistics show that African American women account for 64% of all HIV/AIDS cases reported in 2005 compared with White women (19%) and Hispanic women (15%) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2005). Typically, HIV/AIDS research focuses on prevention for high-risk minority women and men who have sex with men (MSM), while young Black college women are ignored as a risk group. This study examined factors that influence HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 189 young Black women aged 18-24 from a Historically Black University. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires that asked about their condom use with either a boyfriend or casual sex partner in the preceding 12 months, as well as their substance use and condom use self-efficacy. Results indicated that the type of sexual relationship in which the participants' were involved and their self-efficacy are positively associated with their condom use. Substance use was negatively associated with condom use. Adapted from the source document.

Lessons Learned: Building the Capacity of Community-Based Organizations and Health Departments Implementing HIV Interventions in African American Communities

Author: Abrahams, Camille A1; Dacus, Jagadisa-devasri; Wheeler, Darrell P; Taylor, Rona; Latimer, Stacey S; Hearn, Kimberly1 AACBI, New York, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61406998?accountid=14925

Abstract: Even with the medicalization of HIV/AIDS, bringing programs and services into communities requires effective programs and service delivery systems. Developing and maintaining the capacities of these programs are critical. Because capacity building has become such an important part of HIV prevention work, greater attention must be given to the best practices in this area. In this article, the best practices and lessons learned from one national capacity building initiative are presented. Using a nonexperimental approach, the authors present 4 years of capacity building assistance service provision in the field of HIV prevention. Adapted from the source document.

Self-Assessed Spirituality, Worship Attendance, and HIV-Related Preventive Behaviors among Unmarried Ethnic Minority Adults Living in a High AIDS Prevalence Area

Author: Obiaja, Kenneth C1; Darrow, William W; Sanchez-Brana, Elizabeth; Uribe, Claudia L1 Florida International University, Miami, FL

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61406583?accountid=14925

Abstract: We assessed how self-assessed spirituality and frequency of worship influenced HIV-preventive behaviors among single minority 18- to 39-year-olds living in high AIDS prevalence areas of Broward County, Florida. Eligible residents participated in telephone surveys conducted in 2001 and 2002. Most (83.8%) said they considered themselves spiritual persons. Many (45.2%) worshipped every week. Most weekly worshippers (66.1%) were sexually active but were less likely to have used a condom in the past year or to have ever been tested for HIV. To improve HIV-preventive behaviors, we collaborate with places of worship and faith-based organizations to provide culturally congruent HIV/AIDS services. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Interventions for people with HIV/AIDS became a national priority in 2003. While the importance of involving HIV-positive people in the design, delivery, and evaluation of prevention programs is widely recognized, information about how to implement peer-based services in clinic settings is sparse. The four projects described in this article implemented peer-based interventions as part of larger, multi-site Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) initiative. Common themes reported by Project Directors/Evaluators describe the challenges and benefits of peer-based interventions across these programs, including infrastructural, clinical and research-related issues. We also discuss the benefits to Peers, researchers, and the clinics sites. Adapted from the source document.

The Benefits of Women-Only HIV Support Groups

Author: Lennon-Dearing, Robin11 Department of Social Work, East Tennessee State University, P.O. Box 70645, Johnson City, TN 37614-1702 lennon@etsu.edu

Abstract: Women living with HIV often feel isolated. One significant avenue for HIV-positive women to receive the support, information, and affiliation they need is through gender-specific HIV support groups, but research is lacking about how support groups for HIV positive women can be helpful. This exploratory study examined HIV positive women's perceptions about their experiences in women-only HIV support groups. Seventy-one women attending nine women-only HIV support groups in Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina were surveyed. Benefits from attendance included: (a) increase in medication compliance, (b) decreased risk behavior for re-exposure to FIIV, (c) reduced feelings of shame, and (d) a network of friends to socialize with. Results indicate that even if women-only HIV support groups do not stress behavior or lifestyle changes, these are often by-products of support group attendance. Adapted from the source document.

HIV Transmission and Alcohol in the Caribbean: An Agenda for Social Work

Author: Rutledge, Scott Edward1; Siebert, Darcy Clay; Wilke, Dina J1 Temple University, School of Social Administration, 1301 Cecil B. Moore Avenue, Ritter Annex 5th Floor, Philadelphia, PA, 19122-6091

Abstract: This paper overviews the twin epidemics of HIV/AIDS and alcohol use in the Caribbean (specifically the countries and territories included in the Greater and Lesser Antilles and Bahamas), and potential linkages between drinking and risky sexual behavior. Highlighting the needs for research and intervention identified by Caribbean social workers, educators, health care providers, and government officials, we suggest ways social workers both in the Caribbean and abroad can contribute to exploring the co-morbidity of alcohol use and risk for sexual HIV transmission. Data addressing the potential link between alcohol use and risky sexual behaviors are urgently needed to inform prevention and intervention policies and programs at the national and regional level.

Quality of Life Measurement Tools for People Living with HIV/AIDS

Author: Carabin, Helene1; Sonleitner, Nancy K; Keesee, Marguerite; Shinault, Kimberly1 University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, 801 Northeast 13th Street, Room 305, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 helene-carabin@ouhsc.edu

Abstract: Several health related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments have been developed and used in HIV/AIDS research. Selecting an accurate instrument to evaluate how the HRQOL of persons living with HIV/AIDS evolve under care is essential. Accuracy is estimated with statistical methods that determine how HRQOL instruments perform internally and when compared to other measures. We review here the accuracy of measures used in fourteen HIV/AIDS HRQOL instruments. Some dimensions of accuracy have been measured in each of the instruments including construct validity, criterion validity, internal consistency reliability, sensitivity to change, and test-retest reliability, although none of these were evaluated using all measures of accuracy. There is a need for standardization of the statistical methods used to validate HRQOL in HIV/AIDS questionnaires and for an agreement on a standard instrument. Adapted from the source document.

Psychosocial Factors Associated with Disclosure of HIV Positive Serostatus: Understanding the Influence of Depression and Social Support

Author: Gore-Felton, Cheryl1; Power, Rachel; Duran, Ron; Sarlati, Siavash; Palmer, Laura; Koopman, Cheryl; Israelski, Dennis M; Porter, Janet; Spiegel, David1 Stanford University Medical Center, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, 401 Quarry Road, Stanford, CA 94305-5718

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61419923?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the relationships of demographic and psychosocial variables to disclosure of HIV infection. HIV-positive adults (n = 156) completed measures assessing depression, perceived satisfaction with social support, and attitudes related to disclosure among their social network. Nearly everyone in this sample (98%) disclosed HIV status to at least one person. Greater depressive symptoms were reported among participants who experienced regret after disclosure. Moreover, the decision never to disclose was associated with less social support satisfaction. These findings suggest that interventions that develop effective serostatus disclosure skills may be efficacious in decreasing psychosocial distress among HIV-positive adults.

HIV Disclosure: Personal and Policy Perspectives

Author: Linsk, Nathan L1; Gilbert, Dorie J1 Jane Addams College of Social Work, University of Illinois, Chicago

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61427076?accountid=14925

Abstract: Discusses the idea of anonymity for those who have HIV/AIDS and who, and for what reasons, should be informed of specific individuals having these health problems, such as their sexual partners. Further, wishes to consider when outsiders should know based on the normal process of quarantine control, legislative, and personal basis.

Name Based HIV Reporting: Current Status and Advocacy Needs

Author: Cederbaum, Julie11 School of Social Policy & Practice, University of Pennsylvania, 3815 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104-3604 julieced@sp2.upenn.edu

Abstract: In the U.S., the reporting and registration of HIV and AIDS cases has been subject to legal instruction for some time; ethical issues of privacy are a core aspect of the debate. U.S. policy requires reporting of most sexually transmitted infections and all AIDS cases. Unlike AIDS cases, reporting of HIV cases by name has generated considerable debate. Argument for and against reporting HIV by name is reviewed. An assessment of the limits of the debate is undertaken, and suggestions for expanding advocacy are recommended to ensure that persons being tested know how their personal information may be used.

Barriers and Facilitators of HIV Disclosure: Perspectives from HIV-infected Men Who Have Sex with Men

Author: Driskell, Jeffrey R1; Salomon, Elizabeth; Mayer, Kenneth; Capistrant, Benjamin; Safren, Steven1 Fenway Community Health Center, 7 Haviland, Boston, MA 02115 jdriskell@fenwayhealth.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61426485?accountid=14925

Abstract: HIV disclosure among sexually active HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) is a complex phenomenon. To better understand factors that impact the decision-making process regarding HIV disclosure among HIV-infected MSM, the present study analyzed content from previously conducted counseling sessions where HIV disclosure was selected as the primary focus of the session. The counselor/participant dialogue was audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed qualitatively using content analysis. Factors identified as barriers that deter HIV-infected MSM from disclosing include rejection, issues of confidentiality, possible missed sexual opportunities, partner's HIV status, deferred responsibility, sexual partner type, and public sex environments. Participants identified ethical obligation, the potential for a dating relationship, timing of disclosure, and bidirectional communication as facilitators of disclosure. Findings can be used for policy development as well as to guide social workers and other healthcare providers' assessment and development of clinical interventions addressing sexual health among HIV-infected MSM as it relates to HIV disclosure.

Self-Reported Symptoms of Psychological Distress Experienced by Latinos Seeking HIV-Related Mental Health Care

Author: Basta, Tania B1; Reece, Michael; Shacham, Enbal1 E331 Grover Center, Ohio University, Athens, OH 45701 basta@ohio.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61435747?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the symptoms of psychological distress presented by Latinos living with HIV/AIDS upon their self-enrollment into publicly funded HIV-related mental healthcare. Latinos in this sample presented for care with significantly lower levels of psychological distress than the normative sample across three dimensions of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI): obsessive compulsivity (p < .05), interpersonal sensitivity (p < .05), and anxiety (p < .05). Symptoms of somatization (p < .05) and paranoid ideation (p < .05) were significantly higher in this sample than the general population. It appears that Latinos are self-enrolling in mental healthcare services, but their presentations of levels of psychological distress are significantly different from those documented among the general population. These findings offer health professionals additional considerations that may increase the extent to which their services are responsive to the particular issues facing Latinos living with HIV.

Abstract: The aims of this study were to determine the association between service utilization and subjective cognitive complaints among adults with HIV and to identify the predictors of cognitive complaints as a step forward in improving service utilization in this population. Participants were 385 adults with HIV who were receiving care from AIDS service organizations (ASOs) in Alabama. Trained staff administered a face-to-face questionnaire, which assessed cognitive complaints and diverse aspects of service utilization. Significant correlations were found between cognitive complaints and work status, financial difficulties, difficulty getting medical care, legal problems, medication compliance, emotional problems, housing difficulties, counseling for sexual issues, transportation difficulties, and difficulty getting food. Multiple regression analysis identified the following predictors of cognitive complaints: level of education, physical pain, and stress. Given the association between cognitive complaints and service utilization, interventions aimed at reducing cognitive complaints and improving neuropsychological functioning may enhance service utilization and everyday functioning among adults with HIV.

Implications for HIV/AIDS Research and Education among Ethnic Minority Older Adults

Author: Altschuler, Joanne1; Katz, Anne D; Tynan, Margaret A1 School of Social Work, California State University, 5151 State University Drive, Simpson Tower F813, Los Angeles, CA 90032

Abstract: Purpose: Adults over 50 years of age constitute 11% of new AIDS cases reported (CDC, 2007). In addition to consistent rates of infection among older adults, there is a disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on ethnic minority older adults. Despite the steady rise and projections of increase, there is still a paucity of education and prevention programs targeting this population. This article addresses these demographic trends by reporting on findings about HIV/AIDS AIDS knowledge, attitudes toward sexuality, risk behaviors, and participation in HIV/AIDS education programs from an ethnically diverse sample of adults 50 years and older. Design and Methods: A purposive sample (N=249) of ethnically and economically diverse adults 50 years and older were selected from 14 organizations in rural and urban settings in California. They were surveyed to determine their HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes toward sexuality, high-risk behaviors, and interest in participating in HIV/AIDS education prevention programs. Results: (a) ethnic minority group participants had lower levels of knowledge; (b) over 50% of the sample believed that they do not have to be concerned about HIV/AIDS infection; and (c) participants who self-identified as Hispanic were overrepresented in the group that is likely or very likely to attend HIV/AIDS education programs. Implications: Older adults of color 50 years and older are sexually active, lack accurate information about HIV/AIDS and are in need of HIV/AIDS education. Methodological issues and recommendations are made concerning ethnically diverse older adults and HIV/AIDS. Adapted from the source document.

Cost-Effectiveness of Needle and Syringe Exchange for the Prevention of HIV in New York City

Author: Belani, Hrishikesh K1; Muennig, Peter A1 4916 Ridge Road, Edina, MN 55436, USA hkbelani@wustl.edu

Abstract: Shared needle and syringe use among injection drug users continues to be a major mode of transmission of HIV. Needle and syringe exchange (NSE) may be a viable strategy to reduce the transmission of the virus yet the difficulty in measuring the actual efficacy of NSE has limited attempts to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Using data specific to the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center in New York City, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of NSE over a range of conservative estimates of efficacy, obtained from both longitudinal and small-area studies. A decision-analysis model was created to compare the outcomes and costs associated with NSE. Model inputs included the cost of living with HIV and the sero-prevalence of HIV among injection drug users in New York City. This analysis was conducted from both the government and societal perspectives. Tested over a range of conservative parameter estimates, NSF appears to save money and lives. The NSF program we evaluated cost$502 per client and produced a gain of 0.01 quality adjusted life years per client, it also reduced HIV treatment costs by$325,000 per case of HIV averted, and averted 4-7 HIV infections per 1000 clients, producing a net cost savings.

HIV Transmission Factors: Denver MSM Culture and Contexts

Author: Natale, Anthony P11 University of Oklahoma, 1005 South Jenkins Avenue, Rhyne Hall #301, Norman, OK 73019-1060, USA anatale@ou.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61427164?accountid=14925

Abstract: Qualitative methods aid in classifying and assessing cultural and environmental factors and their effect on HIV transmission risk behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM). The present study includes the perspectives of four MSM subgroups (HIV positive MSM, Latino MSM, Back MSM, and MSM between ages 18 and 24) obtained through ethnographic interviews, focus groups, and a sociodemographic survey. Study findings based upon a cross-case analysis of these interviews point to cultural norms such as limited sexual negotiation and substance use as influencing MSM HIV transmission risk. In addition, MSM environments for seeking sexual partners (gay bars, bathhouses, the Internet) contribute to risk in setting-specific ways. The rich information provided by the MSM point to suitable recommendations for system intervention including increasing substance use prevention efforts among MSM, development of interpersonal and sexual negotiation skills, chiefly among young MSM, and the importance of MSM environments for improving HIV prevention.

Managing Funding Constraints in Frontline HIV/AIDS Social Services in Canada

Author: Cain, Roy1; Todd, Sarah1 School of Social Work, (KTH-312), McMaster University, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada cainr@mcmaster.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429652?accountid=14925

Abstract: The need for HIV/AIDS social services continues to grow; workers confront increasingly complex client needs, and changes to government funding policies present new challenges to frontline social workers. Drawing on a qualitative study involving 59 social service practitioners in Ontario, Canada, this paper explores how frontline workers experience policy changes that restrict government funding. Respondents report that many of their clients are focused on immediate needs, such as food or shelter, rather than their HIV infection. They describe how funding cuts can introduce uncertainty into their work, and they note that their work now feels more bureaucratic and less caring. More organizational work is required to access resources and workers often find themselves playing a gate-keeping role. The paper describes how workers try to minimize the negative policy changes they perceive, but sonic of their ways of managing increased demand can actually end up increasing barriers to clients. Findings suggest that changing policies can undermine efforts to involve people with HIV in service delivery and to advocate for changing the social context of the epidemic.

Farmers' Involvement in Behaviors Prone to HIV/AIDS Infection: A Case Study of Southern Nigeria

Author: Oyekale, A S1; Oyekale, T O1 Department of Agricultural Economics, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria asoyekale@yahoo.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61427651?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper analyzed the factors that influence farmers' involvement in some risky HIV/AIDS prone behaviors in the southern part of Nigeria. The data were collected in 2004 from 515 farmers in 5 randomly selected states. Using the Probit regression analysis, it was found that male farmers and those from South-East/South-South have significantly lower probability of involvement in risky behaviors (p < .05). Risk behaviors were associated with lower ages, poverty, higher education, lack of knowledge about HIV prevention, general HIV information, and reported cases of the disease in the village (p < .05). Findings indicate addressing HIV/AIDS in rural areas is paramount for socioeconomic development, and farmers must be educated on appropriate protective methods in order to reduce the rate of infection.

African Stars: Lessons Learned from Social Services in Africa

Author: Steinitz, Lucy Y11 African Field Representative/Senior Regional Technical Officer, Stephen Lewis Foundation/Orphans & Vulnerable Children, Family Health International, Windhoek, Namibia lucy@steinitz.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61409444?accountid=14925

Abstract: In this article, eight lessons are drawn from ten years of HIV-related work in social services in Southern and Eastern Africa. These are: (1) The fight against HIV and the fight against poverty must go hand-in-hand; (2) Underlying social dynamics should be incorporated into an effective HIV-prevention strategy; (3) Listen and act upon what the people who are most affected have to say; (4) Take a bottom up approach and build on what is already working; (5) Answer the call to care by partnering with the church (or mosque or temple); (6) Invest in your volunteers and keep them from burning out; (7) Remember that most orphans are teenagers, and plan accordingly; and (8) If it's not a quality-driven service, it's not worth doing.

Does Anyone Die from AIDS in South Africa?

Author: Riffe, Holly1; Phil, Christa Fouche Dlitt et1 Associate Professor and Director, Latino & Multicultural Center for Regional Development, Northern Kentucky University, Highland Heights, KY, 41099 riffeh@nku.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61420888?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite staggering statistics on AIDS, South African respondents to a study about perceptions surrounding HIV/AIDS from populations at risk claim little knowledge about people dying of AIDS or even of attendance at funerals for someone who has died of AIDS. Using data from focus groups, the authors discuss possible reasons for lack of knowledge of deaths related to HIV/AIDS, including: reticence to publicly admit knowledge; avoidance of contact with affected persons; denial of the impact/extent of the disease; and ignorance of disease symptoms or culturally-consistent diagnoses (i.e., familiar explanations consistent with the culture). Speculation about possible implications of this for people infected and affected by AIDS-related deaths in South Africa lead to the conclusion that all aspects of society must be interwoven and mobilized to develop effective responses to HIV infection.

Abstract: A survey of patients' knowledge of and resources for combating tuberculosis (TB) since the advent of HIV in Lesotho reveals unequal access to resources and confusion of symptoms among TB, HIV/AIDS, and sejeso (an illness attributed to witchcraft). The findings suggest the need for improved health education and resource allocation. Adapted from the source document.

Cultural Determinants of Care and Support for People Living with AIDS in Yoruba Communities of Ibadan and Ilesa, Nigeria

Author: Ajala, Aderemi Suleiman1; Adejumo, Prisca Olabisi1 Lecturer/Researcher, Department of Archaeology & Anthropology, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria asajala@yahoo.co.uk

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61372623?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper examines social and cultural factors influencing care and support for Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in two selected Yoruba communities of Southwestern Nigeria. The increase in morbidity and mortality associated with HIV/AIDS especially in Nigeria is attributed to poor attention giving to PLWHA. Reasons for this poor attention seem to be relative on culture basis. Among the Yoruba, the cultural conception of HIV/AIDS and the perception of PLWHA by the people, have negative impacts on care and support for PLWHAs. Despite the various attempts to alleviate the burdens of HIV/ AIDS on PLWHAs, the problems continue as a nightmare in that society, and contribute to an increase in the number of people down with HIV/AIDS. To understand the problem, an ethnographic study was conducted in Ilesa and Ibadan where 217 respondents were interviewed through the combination of key-informant, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and case study analyses. Data revealed that Yoruba conception of HIV/AIDS and the people's perceptions of PLWHAs create barriers against better care for PLWHA. In addition, it was revealed that poverty, illiteracy and inadequate hospital facilities constitute other hindering factors affecting better care and support for PLWHAs.

Abstract: As HIV prevention has become more focused on evidence-based interventions and service provision for people living with HIV (PLH), providers are faced with challenges engaging and retaining PLH in prevention programs. Lessons learned by intervention facilitators may assist service providers address these challenges. To this end, 12 facilitators of a randomized behavioral intervention, designed to reduce sexual risk among PLH, participated in qualitative feedback groups regarding the challenges engaging and retaining participants and strategies used to overcome barriers. Qualitative methods revealed key components to tailoring prevention programs to successfully engage PLH: making interventions personally relevant, teaching skills that can be applied to participants' life contexts, providing support and consistency, and challenging resistance to sexual behavior change.

Understanding Motivations for Sex Among Detained Youth: Implications for HIV Prevention Programs

Author: Voisin, Dexter R1; Salazar, Laura F; Crosby, Richard A; Diclemente, Ralph J1 School of Social Service Administration, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60637 d-voisin@uchicago.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61423167?accountid=14925

Abstract: This investigation examined reasons for having sex among a sample of 369 African-American and White adolescent detainees, aged 14-18. Using A-CASI technology, sociodemographic variables and motivations for having sex were assessed among this population. Findings indicated that adolescents hold underlying motivations for having sex and that these differ to some degree by gender, SES, but less by race. For programs to be optimally effective, program goals should address gender and SES differentials for having sex. Adapted from the source document.

Extending the Use of the 40-Item HIV-Stigma Scale to Older Adults: An Examination of Reliability and Validity

Author: Emlet, Charles A11 ACSW, Acting Director & Associate Professor, Social Work Program, University of Washington, Tacoma, WA, 98402 caemlet@u.washington.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61414785?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper explores the potential for extending the use of a 40-item stigma scale, developed by Berger and colleagues, to older adults with HIV/AIDS. The increase in the numbers of adults living into older age with HIV, along with new infections in those 50+, makes this issue relevant. A sample of 25 older adults completed the stigma scale, and all answered a semi-structured question about how they felt the scale captured their experiences of stigma. The sample ranged in age from 50 to 72 years (M=56.1 - 5.75); 38% were female, and 40% were people of color. The stigma scale and its 4 subscales showed excellent internal consistency ranging from a = .92 to .96. The scale was found to have good convergent validity with the CES-D depression scale. Sixty-four percent of the respondents felt the scale did a good job capturing their experiences of stigma as older persons living with HIV/AIDS or offered no suggestions for improvement. The scale was found to be reliable and valid for measuring HIV-stigma in the original study and appears to maintain its integrity in a sample of older HIV-infected adults.

The Impact of HIV-Related Stigma on HIV Care and Prevention Providers

Author: Reece, Michael1; Tanner, Amanda E; Karpiak, Stephen E; Coffey, Kate1 Department of Applied Health Science, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, 47405 mireece@indiana.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61423107?accountid=14925

Abstract: Very little is known about the extent to which HIV care and prevention providers who work for U.S. community-based organizations are affected by the types of stigma that have been well documented as impacting those living with HIV and those who provide direct care to these individuals. To explore the existence and characteristics of this phenomenon, the HIV Provider Stigma Scale was developed and administered to 795 HIV service providers in 47 U.S. states. Stigma levels were higher among those whose sexual orientation was reported as heterosexual and those who had worked in the HIV field for less than 5 years. Those with the highest levels of stigma also reported decreased levels of social and occupational functioning. The extent to which the social stigmas of HIV and AIDS impact those who work professionally in the field could have important implications for the continued sustainability of the workforce, particularly in areas of the world with still developing HIV service infrastructures.

Guyanese Health Care Providers' HIV-Related Experiences, Attitudes, and Readiness to Provide Care

Author: Poindexter, Cynthia Cannon11 Associate Professor, Graduate School of Social Service, Fordham University, Tarrytown, NY, 10591 poindexter@fordham.edu

Abstract: This article reports findings from a qualitative study of HIV-related knowledge and attitudes of Guyanese social service and health care providers. Social service and health care practitioners were asked to comment on beliefs and experiences regarding HIV and stigma, readiness to treat persons with HIV, and observations of cultural norms and prevailing attitudes. Two focus groups and six individual interviews led to insights about cultural and economic realities which support or obstruct education and treatment. Themes emerged in the areas of public attitudes and professional practices regarding HIV. The findings suggest that work is needed in Guyana to educate the public and prepare professionals for a burgeoning HIV pandemic. Educational, service, and political efforts should involve Guyanese people and systems at every stage. Adapted from the source document.

A Comparison of Grief Reactions in Cancer, HIV/AIDS, and Suicide Bereavement

Author: Houck, James A11 Assistant Professor of Pastoral Counseling Studies, Department of Pastoral and Theological Studies, Neumann College, Aston, PA, 19014 houckj@neumann.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61414842?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study compared the grief reactions of people who mourned three different types of death: Cancer, HIV/AIDS, and suicide, and addressed the question whether these bereavement groups can be differentiated on the basis of their grief, as measured by the Grief Experience Questionnaire (GEQ; Barrett & Scott, 1989). The results indicate that these groups (cancer: N = 50, AIDS-related: N = 50, and suicide: N = 50) had different grief reactions, specifically, in the areas of stigmatization and unique reactions to suicide. The implications of these results afford grief counselors, health-care providers, and pastoral professionals, intervention strategies that enfranchise people, who may experience one of these types of deaths, to work through their grief. Furthermore, this understanding of specific grief characteristics can also be assimilated into a therapist's preferred bereavement paradigm, for example, stages of grief (Kubler-Ross, 1969), phases of bereavement (Parkes, 1972), or tasks of mourning (Worden, 2004).

Abstract: Maximizing treatment adherence is essential for optimizing clinical outcomes among HIV/AIDS patients. A decade after the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), numerous achievements and continued challenges are evident within research on HIV treatment adherence. In this paper, we illustrate some key themes within current treatment adherence research by highlighting presentations from a recent conference focused on this topic (the 2006 NIMH/IAPAC International Conference on HIV Treatment Adherence). We then discuss several ongoing challenges confronting the field, and suggest that multidisciplinary research will be essential for overcoming these challenges and strengthening our efforts to improve and sustain adherence to HIV treatment.

Psychosocial Predictors of Adherence to Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy: Practical Implications

Author: Gruber, Valerie A1; Sorensen, James L; Haug, Nancy A1 MPH, Associate Clinical Professor, Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94110 email: Valerie.Gruber@sfdph.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61419118?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reviews studies of psychosocial predictors of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) among HIV positive clients. Unstable housing and lack of HIV-specific social support predicted low HAART adherence in the studies where they were tested. The most consistent predictor of adherence problems across all populations and measures was active substance use, particularly cocaine use. Younger age and less than high school education were not consistently predictive. Depression predicted adherence problems measured by self-report but not by electronic monitoring. Supplementing the adherence support efforts by physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, clinicians in a range of disciplines and settings can assess and intervene on psychosocial risk factors and thereby reduce adherence problems regardless of their level of knowledge about HIV medications.

The Relationship Between Type and Quality of Social Support and HIV Medication Adherence

Author: Hamilton, Marie M1; Razzano, Lisa A; Martin, Nicole B1 MPH, Project Manager, Center on Mental Health Services Research & Policy, Department of Psychiatry, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60603 email: Mhamilton@psych.uic.edu

Abstract: In the last 10 years HIV has become a disease that can be effectively managed using antiretroviral medications. However, many factors affect adherence, including demographics, income, housing, mental health issues, and access to health care, as well as types and quality of social support. This paper summarizes results regarding specific sources of social support that are part of a larger, randomized study of medication adherence among people with HIV/AIDS. Results summarize findings from 98 program participants and include information regarding support from partners, family and health care providers, as well as the impact of support from these sources on medication adherence. Among participants in this study, those with higher levels of social support from partners demonstrated higher rates of medication adherence. Those who received more social support from their families, however, reported significantly lower adherence rates. These results suggest that efforts to improve medication adherence need to address the diverse types of social support networks of people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Adapted from the source document.

Predictors of Medication Adherence Among HIV/AIDS Clients

Author: Pomeroy, Elizabeth C1; Thompson, Sanna; Gober, Kelly; Noel, Latonya1 LCSW, Professor, School of Social Work, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78712 Bpomeroy@mail.utexas.edu

Abstract: Lack of adherence to medication regimens among people living with HIV/AIDS can lead to new drug resistant strains of the virus as well as continuing spread of the disease. Due to suboptimal adherence, the prevalence of these resistant strains continues to increase, posing a serious public health risk. Adherence to the various medications must be 95%-100% complete in order to be considered adequate; however, 57% to 77% of patients fail to reach this level of adherence. Treatment of HIV-infected persons with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is often challenging due to the presence of factors that can affect adherence, such as complex regimens, total pill burden, and food dosing restrictions. This study seeks to identify factors that predict medication adherence among HIV positive adults. Independent variables included adherence information, adherence motivation, adherence behavioral skills, demographic factors and environmental factors. Results from the exploratory study using a convenience sample of patients lend support to Fisher's Information-Motivation-Behavior model of HIV prevention. Implications for research and practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Social and Religious Support on Treatment Adherence Among HIV/AIDS Patients by Race/Ethnicity

Author: Sunil, T S1; McGehee, Mary A1 MPH, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology, University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, 78249 email: thankam.sunil@utsa.edu

Abstract: Using data from the second follow-up of the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS), we investigated the influence of social and religious support variables on treatment adherence for Whites, African American and Hispanic HIV patients. Study results show differential effects of social, religious support and background variables on treatment adherence. In general, for Whites, background variables such as educational levels and age were found to be significant variables affecting treatment adherence, in addition to some religious support variables. On the other hand, for African Americans and Hispanics, religious and social support variables were influential. Results also suggest that strategies to improve treatment adherence may vary for different race/ethnic groups. The study highlights the importance of working with and involving religious organizations in an effort to increase adherence and support to HIV-infected members, particularly among African Americans and Hispanic communities.

The Development and Feasibility of an Intervention to Improve HAART Adherence Among HIV-Positive Patients Receiving Primary Care in Methadone Clinics

Author: Cooperman, Nina A1; Parsons, Jeffrey T; Chabon, Brenda; Berg, Karina M; Arnsten, Julia H1 Assistant Professor, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Montefiori Medical Center, Bronx, NY, 10467

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61418838?accountid=14925

Abstract: We developed an adherence counseling program to help HIV-positive, opioid dependent patients, receiving primary care in methadone clinics, to improve adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The intervention is conducted by paraprofessional adherence counselors and consists of six, semi-structured counseling sessions that focus on motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral skills training. To date, we have enrolled 119 patients into adherence counseling, suggesting that patients are interested and receptive to the program. Clinic staff has welcomed the additional support provided by the program, and are working collaboratively with the adherence counselors to provide integrated and comprehensive care. The successful implementation of the adherence counseling program indicates that paraprofessionals can effectively be trained to provide semi-structured adherence counseling and that adherence interventions can be incorporated into existing substance abuse and HIV-related treatment programs.

Specialized Adherence Counselors Can Improve Treatment Adherence: Guidelines for Specific Treatment Issues

Author: Scheid, Teresa L11 Full Professor, Department of Sociology, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, 28223 email: tlscheid@email.unnc.edu

Abstract: Individuals living with HIV disease often have great difficulty adhering to drug treatment regimes. In order to improve treatment adherence clients were referred to a specialized adherence counselor for intensive adherence counseling and education. Instruments were developed which integrated research tools into on-going clinical assessments. The first 30 clients who received adherence counseling were tracked for at least one year in order to assess treatment adherence; 33% were discharged as adherent and 40% exhibited improved adherence; only 10% still had problems with adherence at the 12 month follow-up. This paper describes the role played by specialized adherence counselors and provides a summary of the guidelines that were developed throughout the course of this project. Strategies are offered for helping with diverse adherence problems describing how 'to do' adherence counseling directed towards clinicians working on the front line to improve adherence.

Training Substance Abuse Counselors About HIV Medication Adherence

Author: Bass, Michael1; Linsk, Nathan L; Mitchell, Christopher1 ACSW, CRADC, Doctoral Student, Jane Addams College of Social Work, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, 60607 email: mikebass@uic.edu

Abstract: High levels of medication adherence are crucial to the success of HIV treatment. Consequently, substance abuse counselors (SACs), social service and other care providers can best support their HIV positive clients when they understand adherence and related interventions. This paper describes a training program that was designed to increase counselor knowledge of HIV medications, adherence strategies and enhance counseling skills specific to HIV adherence. For substance abuse counselors the training needs included: better understanding of medication interactions, relapse, recovery, and interdisciplinary communication. Thirty-six SACs from three agencies completed the 11/2-day training, which included lecture discussions, case discussion and interactive client case simulations. Success in accomplishing training objectives was evaluated at three points: pre-intervention training, post-intervention, and six month follow-up to determine changes in participants' knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to adherence counseling. Three case scenarios measuring counselor comfort levels indicated SACs felt significantly more comfortable discussing relapse and medication issues with their HIV affected clients than they would in discussing medication issues with the client's physician. However, they felt slightly more comfortable about physician discussions after training. Open-ended comments by SACs at six-month follow-up provided insights into recovery issues their clients faced. The findings suggest ways medication adherence could fit the reality of serving clients with co-occurring HIV and substance use to better meet their health and support needs.

More Than Drugs: Voices of HIV-Seropositive Individuals with a History of Substance Use Reveal a Range of Adherence Factors

Author: Gilbert, Dorie J1; Abel, Elizabeth; Stewart, Nancy Francisco; Zilberman, Margarita1 LMSW, Associate Professor, School of Social Work, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, 78712

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422297?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study sought to uncover the prevalence of continued drug use and statements about everyday adherence decision-making from a community sample of HIV-seropositive individuals with a history of substance use and also enrolled in antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least six months. Ninety participants attended one of three focus groups and, collectively, generated 100 statements describing their day-to-day motivations and barriers to HIV-medical adherence. In addition, participants' self-reported substance use revealed that just under 40% (n = 33) were juggling substance use and their HIV medication regimens within the past 30 days. The statements reveal varied and complex adherence factors, which included relatively more non-drug-related than drug-related factors. Further, participants non-drug-related statements covered a broad range of reasons related to adherence that tended to fall into the same major categories as those found across other subgroups: system, disease management, patient-provider relationship, and individual factors. The authors discuss the need for providers to consider the breath and complexity of adherence factors that impact readiness to initiate and adhere to ART for this population.

Abstract: This volume brings together a number of articles that focus attention on the challenges of providing culturally-sensitive services to severely underserved people with HIV/AIDS in border communities, which include areas from Texas to California. Challenges abound due to language and cultural health-care beliefs and practices, lack of resources, stigma and fear of rejection from their communities and health-care providers on both sides of the border.

Abstract: This volume is devoted to an informed discussion of HIV/AIDS on the US/Mexico Border and the unique dynamics of HIV/AIDS for border populations. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in this region is made more complex by numerous factors including stigma, and political and psychosocial factors that influence Latino cultural perspectives on human sexuality. The rural nature of many parts of the border presents challenges for patients in overcoming distance barriers and managing privacy concerns. Further, it presents major challenges for administrators of health-care programs in recruitment of English-Spanish bilingual personnel who have expertise in HIV/AIDS and who are culturally sensitive.

A Comparison Study of Homeless and Non-Homeless HIV-Positive Persons Enrolled in Mental Health Care

Author: Smith, Bryce D1; DeWeaver, Kevin L; Reece, Michael1 School Social Work, U Georgia abcsmith@uga.edu

Abstract: Homelessness & HIV are significant social problems that exacerbate one another. While the literature contains a number of descriptive studies on the persons who struggle with these issues, there is a dearth of comparative studies to help social workers better understand the differences between individuals who are HIV-positive & homeless & those who are HIV-positive & domiciled. This study examined the differences in psychological distress, medical illness, care, insurance, & social service acquisition & the impact on service delivery that these differences imply. This study employed a correlational design to examine a sample of 528 HIV-positive persons, 193 homeless & 335 domiciled, who had self-enrolled into care at an HIV-focused mental health clinic. The findings suggest that there are more similarities between homeless & non-homeless HIV-positive persons than were expected. HIV-positive homeless persons were also more likely to access social services such as transportation, housing, & substance abuse treatment. The implications for social workers involved in treatment planning & service delivery are discussed. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Accessing Care for U.S./Mexico Border Populations Living with HIV/AIDS: The Role of HRSA's HIV/AIDS Bureau and the Special Projects of National Significance

Author: Eldred, Lois1; Cheever, Laura; Parham-Hopson, Deborah1 Dept Health and Human Services, Health Resources Services Administration, HIV/AIDS Bureau, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville. E-mail: LEldred@hrsa.gov

Abstract: The Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) provides health-care to underserved areas in the U.S. and addresses disparities in health-care among U.S. populations. HRSA's Ryan White CARE Act provides HIV care and supportive services for persons with HIV and AIDS in the U.S. and its territories. Five projects were funded as Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) from 2001-2005, to improve care and access to HIV services along the U.S.-Mexican Border. These projects developed culturally appropriate and innovative outreach strategies, expanded counseling and testing in border communities, assured continuity of care through intensive case management services and increased clinical capacity through provider training.

Gay Men Living with HIV/AIDS: The Potential for Empowerment

Author: Harris, Gregory E1; Alderson, Kevin G1 Memorial University, Newfoundland, G.A. Hickman Building, St. John's, NL, Canada E-mail: gregharris@rogers.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398196?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present phenomenological study investigated the experiences of 12 gay men living with HIV/AIDS. Results revealed that following their reactions to the diagnosis, most progressed to viewing their lives and their HIV status more positively. Through data analyses, the researchers developed several continuums that describe the HIV trajectory as having empowering qualities. The continuums focus on several cognitive dimensions (i.e., changes in thinking and affect) that represented participants' experiences of obtaining empowerment. The continuums also acted as progress indicators of how well the participants were coping with HIV. The authors offer several implications for mental health professionals working with this clientele.

Socio-Demographic Characteristics of HIV/AIDS Individuals Living and Receiving Care Along the U.S.-Mexico Border Through Five SPNS Demonstration Projects

Author: Keesee, Marguerite S1; Shinault, Kimberly A; Carabin, Helene; Ahmad, Ahmad Saleem G; Anderson, Kermyt G; Brittingham, Timothy R; Williams, Lynda M; Sonleitner, Nancy K; Cajina, Adan; Schuihof, Robyn; Curiel, Herman; Foster, Morris W1 U Oklahoma

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to provide a description of personal lifestyles and demographic characteristics of 1,200 HIV seropositive individuals who volunteered to participate in a Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Initiative conducted in five U.S. demonstration projects located along the U.S.-Mexico border between 2001 and 2004. The results show that HIV/AIDS patients receiving care along the U.S.- Mexico border are predominantly Hispanics (81%) and men who have sex with men (56%). In general, SPNS participants appear to be socio-demographically similar to the general HIV/AIDS population in the U.S. with a few noted exceptions such as age, labor force participation, and variations in mode of transmission by age and gender.

Community-Based Internet Access for People Living with HIV/AIDS: Bridging the Digital Divide in AIDS Care

Author: Kalichman, Seth C1; Eaton, Lisa; Cain, Demetria; Cherry, Charsey; Pope, Howard; Kalichman, Moira O1 Dept Psychology, U Connecticut, Storrs

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398496?accountid=14925

Abstract: The electronic information revolution has important implications for increasing access to health resources & improving health & quality of life for people living with chronic, life threatening illnesses. This article describes the establishment of a community based technology access center (CTAC) in an AIDS service organization. The goals of the CTAC were to increase Internet access among low-income & minority people living with HIV/AIDS. Results of an evaluation of CTAC utilization showed that the goals of increasing Internet access for this particular population were achieved. Content analysis of websites retrieved from CTAC computers indicated that CTAC users searched primarily for commercial, business-related, general resource, & entertainment functions. The CTAC was used less often for searching for health information & for social & supportive functions. Community-based CTACs housed within AIDS service organizations can increase Internet access & potentially improve the quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. Tables, References.

Empowerment: The Evolving Nature of the Relationship Between HIV/AIDS Patients and Their Physicians

Author: Reeves, Patricia M1; Arnold, Tara G1 School of Social Work, 310 Tucker Hall, The University of Georgia, Athens, GA E-mail: reeves@uga.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61421889?accountid=14925

Abstract: Patient empowerment is a recent phenomenon impacting the evolving nature of the relationship between individuals seeking medical assistance and the doctors who provide that assistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate how patient empowerment affects the traditional medical relationship between patients with HIV/AIDS and their physicians. This study employed a basic interpretive qualitative design that used in-depth, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews for data collection. The sample of 14 purposefully selected individuals living with HIV/AIDS reflected diversity in terms of gender, age, race/ethnicity, number of years living with HIV/AIDS, and number of physicians seen for treatment. Data analysis guided by the constant comparative method revealed three themes: Patient empowerment (1) situates responsibility with the patient, (2) redefines patients' perceptions and expectations of their physicians, and (3) promotes a partnership approach to health care. Implications for social service delivery and practice are discussed and directions for future research are recommended. Adapted from the source document.

Exploring Care Access Issues for Mexican-Origin Latinos Living with HIV in the San Diego/Tijuana Border Region

Author: Zuniga, Maria Luisa1; Organista, Kurt C; Scolari, Rosana; Olshefsky, Alisa M; Schulhof, Robyn; Colon, Madeline1 UCSD Division of Community Pediatrics, U California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, Mail Code 0927, La Jolla. E-mail: mzuniga@ucsd.edu

Abstract: Health access issues and dynamics of health access for Latinos living with HIV on the U.S.-Mexico border have not been well- characterized. Health service utilization and related issues unique to Seropositive HIV Latino populations were explored and findings are presented from two focus groups with Mexican women and men living with HIV in the San Diego/Tijuana U.S.-Mexico border. Cross-cutting border issues (same as Trans-border issues) included lack of continuity in HIV treatment options in Mexico, provider and social stigma of AIDS patients in Mexico, and fears of crossing the border to the U.S. for appointments. Findings indicate a need for coordinated bi-national efforts at HIV/AIDS research and services for border region inhabitants. Adapted from the source document.

Giving Positive HIV Test Results to Clients: A Comparative Analysis of Six Sites

Author: Roberts, Kathleen Johnston1; Grusky, Oscar; Swanson, Aimee-Noelle1 c/o Grusky -- Dept Sociology, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382543?accountid=14925

Abstract: Intensive field studies of HIV testing sites were conducted in order to identify key factors associated with the process of giving HIV positive test results to clients. Direct field observations & semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 HIV test providers/counselors. Five components of the process of giving HIV positive test results were found: (1) verifying clients' identities, (2) collecting contact information, (3) communicating results, (4) linking to treatment & services, & (5) managing client & staff emotions. Results highlight the complex nature of the work of communicating HIV positive test results. Examples include the problem for counselors when they encounter clients who intentionally mislead site staff in order to obtain another person's test result & the difficulty counselors face in separating their work from their personal life.

"Wearing Two Hats": Work-Related Needs of HIV-Seropositive Women Working in the HIV Field

Author: Poindexter, Cynthia Cannon11 Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service, North Hall, Tarrytown, NY E-mail: Poindexter@fordham.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61417500?accountid=14925

Abstract: Persons living with HIV disease are reported to be more frequently returning to volunteer or paid work because antiretroviral medications have improved their health, functioning, and productive years. With more HIV-seropositive people available to the workforce, especially as service providers, social service organizations should better understand their experiences, assets, and needs. This article reports on support group sessions with four HIV-seropositive women who were experiencing extraordinary stress levels due to their memberships in several domains: they were living with HIV; mothers of HIV-seropositive and HIV-seropositive-affected children; partnered with HIV-seropositive men; and working in the HIV field. This discussion is intended to illuminate what social service organizations, managers, and supervisors can do to facilitate job performance and satisfaction for HIV-seropositive workers.

HIV/AIDS Outreach in Southern New Mexico: From Design to Implementation

Author: Valverde, Michelle1; Felderman-Taylor, Jennifer1 Dept Sociology and Anthropology, New Mexico State U, P.O. Box 30001, Las Cruces. E-mail: mvalverde@zianet.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390443?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper describes the outreach component of the New Mexico Border Health Initiative (NMBHI), one of five Special Projects of National Significance funded in 2000 along the United States/Mexico border by the Health Resources and Services Administration. The initial intent of the NMBHI was to utilize the traditional promotor model of natural helpers within the informal support systems in the communities in which they physically live for the purpose of increasing utilization of HIV/AIDS prevention services. What evolved instead was more closely aligned with traditional street outreach, whereby peers were utilized to engage and inform potential clients about HIV prevention, provide HIV testing and link HIV-affected persons to medical services. Programmatic elements, implications for practice, and recommendations for program coordinators are presented in the paper. Adapted from the source document.

When It Happens to Your Family: One Social Worker's Response

Author: Thomas, Norma D11 Center Ethnic & Minority Aging, Philadelphia, PA cemaorg@aol.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61376101?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article is a case study of how an African American family that includes a social worker, responded when three members received an HIV/AIDS diagnosis; two of whom are now deceased. It provides a retrospective look at a family's response to the diagnosis & resilience in the face of terminal illness. This is a personal story presented originally at the HIV/AIDS conference titled "A Social Work Response," held in Los Angeles, California in 1997. The article provides insight to practitioners as well as offers a comparative experience for those who have also passed along on a similar journey. This family faced terminal illness many times, but until one of the matriarchs was diagnosed with AIDS in 1989, this was always an illness that happened to someone else's family. References.

Facilitators and Barriers to Care for Haitian Americans with HIV or AIDS

Author: Barsky, Allan E1; Albertini, Velmarie L1 Florida Atlantic University, School of Social Work, Fort Lauderdale, FL E-mail: barsky@barsky.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61401232?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since the outbreak of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, Haitian Americans living in the United States have not only been one of the groups most affected by HIV/AIDS, but also one of most underserved groups in relation to health and social services. This ethnographic study explores facilitators and barriers to health and social services, which have been identified by Haitian Americans infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS, and provides recommendations to health and social service providers for improving access to services for this population.

Mothers Disclosure of Maternal HIV Status to Children: Key Psychosocial Correlates

Author: Letteney, Susan11 Social Work Progam, York Coll City U New York, Jamaica letteney@york.cuny.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382597?accountid=14925

Abstract: The present study examines the relationship between maternal disclosure of HIV status to children & key psychosocial variables. The article identifies three key psychosocial characteristics that may play a role in maternal HIV status disclosure to children: HIV-related perceptions of stigma, HIV-related stigma management, & social support. Eighty-eight (88) HIV women with children enrolled in outpatient care at an urban medical center completed the HIV-Related Perceptions of Stigma & HIV-Related Stigma Management measures, the Profile of Mood States (POMS), & items measuring social support & disclosure to children. Mothers who disclosed their HIV status to their children reported significantly fewer perceptions of HIV-related stigma, less use of concealment to manage HIV-related stigma, & more social support than mothers who did not disclose to their children. No differences were found between disclosure groups for physical or psychological distress. The perception of stigma attached to a mother's HIV positive status & strategies for managing this stigma emerged as the principal findings of the present study. These findings provide empirical support for identifying stigma & its management as a central focus for professionals working in the field of HIV & families. Additional empirical research is needed to fully understand the factors that influence maternal HIV status disclosure to children. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Thai Women's Experiences with HIV/AIDS: Perspectives on Coping

Author: Sorajjakool, Siroj11 Griggs Hall, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA E-mail: ssorajjakool@rel.llu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422031?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study is based on interviews with 10 Thai women living with HIV/AIDS in northern Thailand. It is an attempt to learn how individuals who have no access to mental health facilities cope with distress in life. The analysis shows three important factors that enhance coping ability: support and acceptance from families and friends, life purpose, and religious beliefs (Buddhism) pertaining to the acceptance of mortality. It concludes by suggesting the need to recognize other ways of coping beyond the scope of traditional Western psychotherapeutic approaches. Adapted from the source document.

An Exploratory Study of HIV Prevention with Mexican/Latino Migrant Day Laborers

Author: Organista, Kurt C1; Alvarado, Nicholas J; Balblutin-Burnham, Amity; Worby, Paula; Martinez, Sergio R1 U California, Berkeley, CA. E-mail: DRKCO@Berkeley.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384513?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this exploratory study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a pilot HIV prevention intervention with one of the most mobile of U.S.-Mexico transborder populations: Mexican/Latino migrant day laborers (MDLs). Intervention development was informed by preliminary research that included an HIV risk survey of over a hundred MDLs, and a focus group to explore the topic of HIV in the lives of MDLs. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the intervention, and to identify some of the contextual characteristics of HIV risk factors in the MDL experience. For example, the most frequent theme revealed by qualitative analysis was the stressful and vulnerable state of desesperacion [desperation], resulting from earning too little money, that participants linked to deviating from their migration goals and succumbing to alcohol and drug use, and risky sex. While empirical results are limited by the small sample of convenience (N = 23), lack of a control group, and loss of about half of the sample by one month follow-up evaluation, findings were encouragingly consistent with intervention goals: Post-intervention data revealed what appear to be substantial gains in carrying condoms (e.g., from 43% to 83%) as well as in knowledge of proper condom use. Further, frequency of sex with risky sex partners decreased in general, while condom use was reported for all sexual encounters assessed during post-evaluation. The theoretical framework used to guide the intervention, a hybrid of the Health Belief Model and Friere's model of participatory education, included visual triggers composed of customized Mexican lottery game cards to elicit discussion of HIV risk and prevention in the MDL experience.

Abstract: Consumer Research Associates from the Suffolk University Center for Public Management conducted three needs surveys in 1997, 2000, and 2005 titled "Voices of Experience," with approximately 450 peer interviews conducted each year. These surveys were used to assess changing service needs, outcomes, and consumer satisfaction for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and to monitor service delivery in the Boston Eligible Metropolitan Area (EMA) located in Eastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire of the Ryan White Care Act Title I and Massachusetts Title II and state-funded programs. The assessments support the importance of continuing to adequately fund a broad mix of services to support the medical and social service needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS.

Abstract: Female sex workers (FSWs) 18 or older who reported having unprotected sex with at least one client within the previous month were recruited in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. After a baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to either: (1) Proyecto Comparte Sexo Mas Seguro ("Share Safer Sex"), a theory-based counseling intervention to increase the use of condoms; or (2) time-equivalent voluntary HIV counseling and testing. Participants had unprotected sex with approximately 27% of clients over the one-month reporting period, and approximately 5% of FSWs in both study conditions tested HIV-seropositive. FSWs in the intervention and comparison conditions showed no significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics, sexual risk behaviors, or HIV serostatus, which indicates that randomization was successful. Future challenges entail participant follow-up and evaluation of intervention effects. Adapted from the source document.

Informal Social Support for HIV Medical Care

Author: Waddell, Elizabeth Needham1; Messeri, Peter1 Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health, Mailman School of Public Health, B-2, New York, NY E-mail: ecn5@columbia.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61405365?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship of availability of HIV-related information and emotional support necessary to obtaining appropriate medical care. Multivariate models control for use of professional case management, mental health services, and drug treatment services. Study data were obtained from the first two rounds of interviews from the New York City Community Health Advisory and Information Network (CHAIN). Household information support and professional ancillary services were significantly associated with entry into appropriate medical care. Among participants in appropriate care at the baseline, only professional services were significantly associated with continuity of care. Adapted from the source document.

A Transcultural Case Management Model for HIV/AIDS Care and Prevention

Author: Ramos, Rebeca L1; Ferreira-Pinto, Joao B1 US Mexico Border Health Association. E-mail: rebeca@utep.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61384567?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Transcultural Case Management (TCM) intervention utilizing community health-care workers-Promotores- was designed to increase adherence to Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) treatment. The TCM model was also expected to help reduce the use of hospital emergency rooms, the number of hospitalization days, and consequently to lower treatment costs among Hispanic HIV-positive male patients. The intervention results, although not statistically significant because of a higher than expected attrition rate and difficulties in accessing patients for follow-up, were in the expected direction. Furthermore, the self-reported quality of life of the patients increased by the development of social networks among patients and by an increased sense of self-reliance and empowerment. Problems encountered in fulfilling the goals of the research protocol, and recommendations on how to improve research in HIV care organizations are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

Organizational Correlates of Specialized Substance Abuse Treatment Provision to Seropositive Clients: A Political Economy Perspective

Author: Ghose, Toorjo11 CIRA, Yale University, Suite 1B, New Haven, CT E-mail: Toorjo.Ghose@yale.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422049?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data from the Alcohol and Drug Services Study, 1996-1999 (United States Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2002), a nationally representative sample of 2,351 drug treatment programs were examined to identify organizational predictors of specialized substance abuse treatment provision to seropositive clients. The Political Economy Perspective developed by Wamsley and Zald (1976) was used to interpret results. A minority of facilities (22%, 517) provided specialized treatment. Among internal political economy measures, provision of mental health (p <0.01), basic HIV services (p <0.05), as well as methadone maintenance treatment (p < 0.05) were significantly and positively associated with specialized treatment provision. Among external political economy measures, managed care funding significantly decreased the likelihood of specialized treatment provision (p < 0.05), while parent organization control (p <0.01) and number of clients (p < 0.01) significantly increased it. Specialized treatment provision was significantly positively associated with proportion of Blacks, Hispanics, seropositives (p < 0.01 for all), and injection drug users (p < 0.05).

Social Service Delivery Preferences Among African American Women Who Use Crack Cocaine: What Women Say They Need Before They Can Be Open to HIV Prevention Services?

Author: MacMaster, Samuel A11 College of Social Work, University of Tennessee, Nashville, TN E-mail: smacmast@utk.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422067?accountid=14925

Abstract: African American women involved in high-risk, substance use-related behaviors are affected by extremely high rates of HIV infection. While research has demonstrated that HIV is preventable, in order for prevention efforts to be successful in reducing disparities, perceptions of African American women who use crack cocaine need to be taken into account. This qualitative study presents results of eleven focus groups with eighty-nine African American women respondents presenting their perceptions of service needs and preferences for service delivery. The results indicate two important findings for social service providers: the respondents' lack of a perceived need for HIV prevention services as a spontaneously identified need, and respondents' desires for more basic services such as childcare, safe shelter, basic necessities, and especially substance abuse treatment before they could be approached about HIV prevention services. The findings are relevant for developing gender- and culture-specific prevention strategies to reduce the spread of HIV. Adapted from the source document.

The Case for an Integrated Approach to HIV/AIDS Prevention: Support and Treatment Services in Canada

Author: Veinot, Tiffany C11 North Campus Building, Room 240, The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada E-mail: tveinot@uwo.ca

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61364091?accountid=14925

Abstract: Worldwide, there is growing policy support for providing integrated HIV/AIDS services. Accordingly, this paper examines the challenges as well as the merits for implementing an integrated approach to HIV/AIDS services in Canada. Through a discussion of the interconnections between HIV/AIDS prevention, support, and treatment, the author outlines how these issues are fundamentally intertwined in the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) and those at risk of HIV infection. This suggests that provision of comprehensive HIV/AIDS services requires approaching these issues from an integrated perspective. The author outlines two existing models of integrated HIV/AIDS services to show the potential viability of such an approach, and concludes with policy recommendations to support service integration.

Development of a Community-Based Participatory Research Effort to Evaluate Conventional HIV Testing (CHT) and HIV Rapid Testing (HRT)

Author: Gleason-Comstock, Julie1; Streater, Alicia; Calhoun, Cindy Bolden; Simpson, Harry L; Rolack, Rosalind; Norman, Silas, Jr1 Department of Community Medicine (CM), School of Medicine (SOM), Wayne State University (WSU), Saint Antoine, Detroit, MI E-mail: jgleason@med.wayne.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61422095?accountid=14925

Abstract: A community-based participatory research (CBPR) project was created to study the effects of changing HIV testing protocols on client risk behaviors in an urban area. Concerns raised by the agency advisory group led to development of research questions that needed to be addressed within the community. The article focuses on development of the research partnership and study enrollment during the first year of the project. Challenges of assimilating rapid advances in health technology while conducting outreach to high-risk clients are discussed.

HIV/AIDS Knowledge and Perceptions Among African American Male and Female College Students at a Historical Black University

Abstract: With the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection continuing to increase among young, African American men and women, it is necessary to examine the breadth of their knowledge on HIV prevention strategies. This study assesses the reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of students attending a Southern urban commuter campus at a Historically Black University. Major differences among males and females, as well as factors influencing testing, issues of safer sex, and perceptions of being HIV infected are examined. The cross-sectional survey data was collected using a self-administered instrument with 238 African American female and male students. Knowledge of transmission was relatively accurate. The majority of students were aware of testing services available to them, though less than 50% of the students reported using services on campus or in their community. There were several significant gender differences in attitudes and knowledge about social supports and condom use. The findings are important for social service providers to consider when developing and/or integrating HIV prevention into a culturally responsive service delivery approach.

Abstract: Discusses the use of community based HIV/AIDS programs to meet the needs of a diverse population of residents. The focus of these programs has shifted from HIV/AIDS education and prevention to broader demands fro health promotion, community development, and varied support services. Argues that collaboration efforts between housing, public health, school, child-welfare, and family-based programs need to happen to address the diverse needs of both HIV/AIDS prevention as well as people living with HIV/AIDS.

Developing HIV Service-Enriched Permanent Housing in Five Cities: Perspectives of Social Services Staff

Author: Sotheran, Jo L; Patterson, Elizabeth K; Aidala, Angela A

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375990?accountid=14925

Abstract: Newer antiretroviral treatments are adding years to the lives of people with HIV. At the same time, the face of the epidemic is changing to include increasing numbers of people with other diagnoses, especially chronic substance use and/or mental illness, that compromise their ability to secure and maintain permanent housing. Social service providers are increasingly attempting to meet the need for permanent supportive housing. However, many social service providers are new to developing specialized permanent housing, and little practical guidance exists. We use the experience of five agencies participating in the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) Multiple Diagnoses Initiative to explore the potential pitfalls and solutions in developing these programs, from the point of view of providers from social service rather than housing backgrounds.

An Exploratory Study: HIV/AIDS Educational and Prevention Programming in Domestic Violence Shelters

Author: Rountree, Michele A11 School Social Work, U Texas, Austin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61387956?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this exploratory study is to identify the current practices & barriers related to the use of HIV/AIDS risk assessment measures & the provision of HIV/AIDS prevention services in seven domestic violence shelters in Arizona. Interviewees reported several structural impediments to the integration of risk assessment measures & educational/prevention services related to HIV/AIDS including fiscal constraints, enhanced training of staff, hiring of new staff, discrimination by staff & a need for an interdisciplinary approach. Client factors included the stage of recovery potentially interfering with the risk assessment measure process & the behavioral integration of HIV/AIDS education & preventative information. 33 References.

Examining the Perceptions of Service Providers for Persons Living with HIV/AIDS in Rural Localities: A Pilot Study

Author: Eastman, Brenda J1; Lieving, Bernard H, III; Bunch, Shelia Grant1 School Social Work, East Carolina U, Greenville, NC eastmanbr@mail.ecu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61394211?accountid=14925

Abstract: There is an increased level of concern that current service structures in rural localities are ill prepared to meet the needs of a growing population of persons infected with HIV/AIDS. Persons living with HIV/AIDS in rural localities face greater stigma, limited accessibility, & restricted resources that further isolate this historically underserved population. This exploratory study utilizes a non-probability purposive sample to investigate the perceptions of service providers in rural regions of North Carolina. Investigators developed & administered a self administered survey comprised of quantitative & qualitative questions targeting service provider perceptions about the general public; perceptions about consumers of services; provider self perceptions, & perceptions related to inter & intra-agency issues. Findings indicate that service providers perceive deficits in public knowledge, social & health services, agency resources, & provider resources. Implications of these findings are discussed as well as the need for continued research efforts. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

The Use of Standardized Patient Encounters for Evaluation of a Clinical Education Program on the Development of HIV/AIDS-Related Clinical Skills

Author: Dieckhaus, Kevin D1; Vontell, Susan; Pfeiffer, Carol; Williams, Ann1 U Connecticut Health Center, Farmington dieckhaus@up.uchc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388029?accountid=14925

Abstract: The success of medical education is traditionally gauged by performance on written examinations. However, clinical proficiency in real-world situations is difficult to assess by written examinations alone. We developed a novel evaluation tool to measure the development of HIV-specific clinical skills using Standardized Patient Encounters (SPEs). Trainees were evaluated at baseline & after an HIV clinical training module by (1) self-reported confidence with HIV-specific clinical skills, & (2) performance assessments using SPEs. Case scenarios were designed to incorporate unique issues associated with HIV that may present to a primary care provider. SPEs were scored based on written documentation including problem list & plan as well as a review of the videotapes by HIV specialists evaluating key elements of clinical skills & decision making. Improvements were noted in multiple facets of the encounters. The use of SPEs enables evaluation of clinical training interventions on the development of HIV-related clinical skill sets.

Look What God Can Do: African-American Gay Men, AIDS and Spirituality

Author: Miller, Robert L11 School Social Welfare, U Albany State U New York, NY rmiller@albany.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61368049?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study describes how ten African American gay men understand & utilize spirituality while living with AIDS. The narrative data indicate spirituality is a significant strength for these men. The participants describe spirituality, a relationship with God, as interactive, integrative, & protective. They indicate that spirituality helps them live with AIDS & alleviates death anxiety. The participants also posit that their experience with AIDS has strengthened their spirituality. Spirituality is an important resource for the men in this study. The data suggests social workers who work with this population explore the salience of spirituality in the lives of their clients.

A Kaleidoscope of Care for HIV-Infected Substance Use

Author: Tobias, Carol1; Brown, Kate; Rajabiun, Serena; Drainoni, Mari-Lynn; Young, Steven R1 Boston U School Public Health, MA tcarol@bu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61370153?accountid=14925

Abstract: The substance abuse treatment & HIV health care systems have different treatment approaches, & many HIV-infected substance users fall through the cracks between systems. Providers are often challenged by the difficulty of engaging & retaining HIV-infected substance users in care & working across disciplines to coordinate services. A Kaleidoscope of Care is a cross-disciplinary curriculum in HIV & substance use, designed to train HIV health care & substance abuse treatment professionals in providing better care to the clients they share in common. It applies adult learning principles to engage diverse professionals in building skills to promote health & adherence, engagement & retention in care, harm reduction, & interdisciplinary collaboration. Early evaluation of the curriculum indicates that it has enhanced knowledge & built skills in serving HIV-infected substance users among providers from multiple disciplines.

HIV Education, Prevention, and Outreach Programs in Rural Areas of the Southeastern United States

Author: Zuniga, Miguel A1; Buchanan, Robert J; Chakravorty, Bonnie J1 Dept Health Informatics, School Allied Health Sciences, Medical Coll Georgia, Augusta mzuniga@mcg.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61380437?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study describes HIV education, prevention, and outreach activities, including barriers to providing these services, to clients in rural areas of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina. We present responses from 222 AIDS service and public health organizations. The questionnaire defined rural "as a town, village, or county with fewer than 50,000 people that is not part of a larger metropolitan area." About one-fourth of the clients served by these organizations were female and about one-third were African American. Among the perceived most successful programs provided were outreach efforts, health education and risk reduction, and one-to-one client education or outreach. However, major challenges to providing these programs were lack of funds and a lack of qualified staff. Social stigma, privacy concerns, and community attitudes also presented additional obstacles to providing services in rural areas. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Utilizing the Clinical Social Work Model to Foster Collaboration among HIV Providers in North Carolina

Author: Lombard, Frank1; Whetten, Kathryn; Forry, Nikki; Despard, Mat1 c/o Whetten -- Health Inequalities Program, Duke U, Durham, NC

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61388053?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article demonstrates one effort to examine the applicability of client behavioral change models to medical provider & case manager behavioral change. The clinical social work model is used to explain the behavioral change process when providers were asked to utilize a voluntary & complex data management system to manage clients' HIV care. Through intense psychosocial support & training initiatives, providers were able to alter their behaviors so that they could successfully integrate new strategies & technologies into their practice while providing better quality care to their clients. 1 Appendix, 22 References.

Webcasting: An Innovative Approach to HIV/AIDS Professional Training in Rural Setting

Author: Waddell, Richard D1; Kulig, Raymond P1 Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61382868?accountid=14925

Abstract: The epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in New Hampshire (NH) mirrors the rest of the nation (New Hampshire Department of Health & Human Services [NHDHHS], 2004); however, the demographics & physical setting of the state are different. With HIV seroprevalence at about 1% & many health care providers working in rural settings with few educational resources available to them, the challenges for keeping providers well informed about HIV/AIDS care & prevention issues are significant. The AIDS Education & Training Center for NH examined several distance learning modalities to determine which would be the best method for the monthly AIDS Seminar Series. The modalities included Real, Media Player & Quicktime, amongst others. This article describes the selection process & our experiences using on-line Webcasts as a way to enhance & achieve successful distance learning for health care providers working in HIV/AIDS in a rural setting. The terms streaming & webcasts are used interchangeably throughout the article. Though streaming is a method of transmission & webcast is an event, they have become intertwined & are often used to describe each other. References. Adapted from the source document.

Assessment of HIV-Related School Policy in North Carolina

Author: Fair, Cynthia1; Garner-Edwards, Dara; McLees-Lane, Mary1 Human Services Dept, Elon U, NC cfair@elon.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61375677?accountid=14925

Abstract: This paper presents results from a content analysis of HIV-related school policy in North Carolina. A policy assessment tool was developed and applied based on recommendations drawn from the professional literature. Four major policy content areas were identified: (1) access, (2) confidentiality/communication, (3) medication issues, and (4) HIV education. Of 79 responding school systems, 68 had established policies which were compared to the recommendations acknowledged in the literature. Results indicate a general failure of local school boards to implement the type of detailed HIV-related school policies described in the professional literature. Overall, North Carolina school policies lacked statements referring specifically to HIV/AIDS. Specificity is necessary to protect the rights of HIV-infected children to an education in the least restrictive environment and to protect their confidentiality. It is also necessary for policies to specify details related to HIV education of students and staff. Schools received individualized feedback regarding their HIV/AIDS policy, thereby providing the information necessary for policy improvement. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Purpose: Because of the faith community's historical response to HIV/AIDS, some religious leaders, local community activists, & public health professionals are challenging this institution to get involved in the struggle against HIV especially among adolescents. The paper reviews the historic process & reports findings from a study, which assess Southern Rural Florida pastors' perception of & involvement in STI/HIV prevention education of their adolescent members. Method: Surveys were administered to 43 African-American pastors of three denominations to describe exsisting STI/HIV prevention efforts targeting adolescents within their churches & pastors' perceptions of the STI/HIV & drug prevention needs of their adolescent members. Results: Forty-two percent of the churches had existing educational prevention discussions focused on condom use, pregnancy & STI/HIV prevention, & what constitutes appropriate sexual behavior, while 58% did not. Pastors with programs (83%) & without program (64%) desired specifically designed formal prevention programs. All pastors desired program content consistent with abstinence while 50% & 39% desired additional content on condom use & negotiating safer sex behavior, respectively. Conclusion: The existence of faith-based prevention programs offers hope as churches assume a facilitator role in prevention services;however, their rather narrow & conservative agenda may be perceived as a barrier to effective intervention prevention.

Abstract: This article describes a multi-disciplinary HIV clinical training model developed & implemented by the Division of AIDS Education at the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)-Center for Continuing & Outreach Education (CCOE), the New Jersey Local Performance Site (LPS) of the New York/New Jersey AIDS Education & Training Center (AETC). The Longitudinal Training (LT) model combines AETC, Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) & other available training resources into an adaptable framework that can be implemented by any clinical training entity (e.g., other AETCs, Public Health Training Centers, Center for Mental Health Services grantees, state health departments, STD/HIV Prevention Training Centers, etc.) to provide needs-based, multi-discipline longitudinal training of healthcare providers so as to enhance the HIV care capacity of community health centers serving predominantly minority populations. In addition to describing the AETC & MAI Programs, this paper will discuss the methods used in developing the Longitudinal Training model & will include styles of training, identification of program successes & barriers, a composite case study & continuous outcome measures.

Author: Fernandez, Angela R1; Keigher, Sharon M; Stevens, Patricia E1 c/o Keigher -- Helen Bader School Social Welfare, U Wisconsin-Milwaukee

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61394270?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article illuminates the main risks that American Indian/Alaska Native women face for contracting the human immunodeficiency virus, & their challenges in living with HIV disease, by presenting a case study of one Native woman's experiences. The woman, a member of a Midwestern Indian tribe, was a participant in a larger in-depth qualitative longitudinal study of 55 women living with HIV. The findings about her path to healing provide insights for understanding & serving this neglected ethnic population, & her words eloquently articulate the struggles of women of color living in dignity with HIV. The article explores potential venues for reaching Native women with culturally relevant prevention & intervention methods, emphasizing the importance of Native culture & spirituality. References.

Religious and Spiritual Supports of the Christian African-American HIV-Affected Grandparent Caregiver

Author: Phillips, Irene

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61398662?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study explores the religious and spiritual supports grandparent custodial caregivers seek from the African-American church. Six female, Christian African-American HIV-affected grandparents living in North Carolina were interviewed. These caregivers perceive God and prayer to be essential to their intrinsic ability to cope. In addition to having the church pray for persons living with HIV/AIDS and their families, the grandparents would like the church to take a more active role in educating the community on HIV/AIDS prevention and in reducing the stigma associated with the disease. They seek little church support for themselves personally, but hope that through the church's efforts, others will not have to endure what they are experiencing. With this knowledge comes better informing HIV/AIDS education program design. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Therapist's Expectations of Psychotherapy Duration for Individuals Living with HIV

Author: Reece, Michael1; McBride, Kimberly; Shacham, Enbal; Williams, Barbara1 Dept Applied Health Science, Indiana U, Bloomington mireece@indiana.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61391740?accountid=14925

Abstract: Data were collected from 102 psychotherapists providing mental health care to individuals living with HIV at a mental health clinic in the Southeastern United States for the purpose of assessing the perceptions of therapists with regard to necessary therapy duration for a range of mental health issues & disorders. Analyses were conducted to explore the extent to which therapists perceived the need for different therapy durations for individuals living with HIV than those who had not received such a diagnosis. Across all mental health issues assessed, therapists indicated a greater need for therapy duration when an HIV diagnosis was also present, & this generally was consistent without regard to therapist education, demographics, or therapeutic orientation. Given the extent to which mental health care is often a routine component of the HIV social services infrastructure, the findings of this study have important implications for mental health providers, mental health training programs, & the staff & volunteers of other HIV-related organizations. 2 Tables, 34 References.

What Is Capacity Building? Lessons from a National Demonstration Program of HIV Education for Social Service Providers

Author: Millery, Mari P1; Messeri, Peter A1 Mailman School Public Health, Columbia U, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61390541?accountid=14925

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine the concept of capacity building & describe an HIV/AIDS education program for social service providers that implemented capacity building in nine ethnic/racial minority communities in the U.S. Quantitative & qualitative evaluation data from the Targeted Provider Education Demonstration (TPED) will be presented to illustrate a capacity building approach. Training-of-trainers (TOT) was a central mechanism for transferring expertise to local communities, & program effectiveness was demonstrated by having 60% of all training programs in the last project year delivered by TOT trainees. Lessons learned about capacity building became a major outcome of the TPED evaluation. It was essential to provide technical assistance & address organizational development issues in participating community-based agencies. These agencies were utilized as a mechanism of rooting the interventions in the local communities in a sustainable way. Reinforcement of inter-organizational linkages facilitated growth of community capacity. Amulti-level model of capacity building that emerged based on the TPED experience is discussed in the context of literature on capacity building. Tables, References. Adapted from the source document.

Assessing Clients' Progress through a Permanency Planning Program

Author: Reich, Warren A1; Hudis, Jan1 The Family Center, NY wreich@thefamilycenter.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61397116?accountid=14925

Abstract: Eighty-five HIV-positive mothers were tracked in a descriptive analysis of progress through a nonprofit organization's program of legal and mental health services designed to assist ill parents in making a permanency plan for their children after the parent's death. Data on service utilization was analyzed using a Hierarchical Classes (HICLAS) analysis, which uncovered an interpretable pattern of services that clearly distinguished basic (e.g., intake), legal, and clinical services. From the HICLAS output we created an index of progress: [no services] < [basic services only] < [basic + legal services] < [basic + legal + clinical] services. An index of mood was constructed from staff ratings of clients during home visits. Multiple regression analyses revealed that the number of different moods observed in a client was positively correlated with progress. Number of moods was also positively correlated with positive outcome, that is formulating a legal permanency plan and/or transferring care of the child to a new caregiver. Mediation analyses suggested that number of observed moods influences progress, which in turn increases the likelihood of a positive outcome. A second study replicated the prediction of mood on progress in a group of new caregivers who were not mothers. Tables, Figures, References. Adapted from the source document.

Do Age and Gender of Social Supports Matter for Low-Income African-American Women Attending an HIV Prevention Program?

Author: Pinto, Rogerio M1; McKay, Mary M1 Center Clinical & Behavioral Studies, New York State Psychiatric Instit, Columbia U

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61433810?accountid=14925

Abstract: Although social support has been linked to improvement in health behaviors, little is known about social support among those most affected by the AIDS epidemic: low-income, young adult, African-American women & their children. Since the age & gender of informal support providers have been shown to influence the types & degrees of social support one receives, this paper examines differences in types & degrees of social support, by age & gender of support persons, received by self-identified African-American female caretakers (n = 197) attending an HIV prevention program. Age of support person was positively associated to overall perceived social & emotional support, as well as to the support person's willingness to help respondents. Adult persons appeared to provide more overall social support to respondents, & to be more eager to help, than did younger persons, even though adult supports made fewer personal contacts. Respondents received significantly more overall social & emotional support from females than from males. Implications for family-based HIV prevention are discussed. 4 Tables, 67 References.

Knowledge and Use of AIDS and Aging Services by Older, HIV-Infected Adults

Author: Emlet, Charles A11 U Washington, Tacoma

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61516149?accountid=14925

Abstract: Older adults living with HIV/AIDS require a complex array of services. Such needs can be addressed both by the service network developed for HIV as well as the network developed for older persons. This study of adults, age 50 & over with HIV/AIDS (N = 41), compared the knowledge & use of services commonly available from the HIV network as well as the aging network. The study sample had similar knowledge of HIV services & services designed for older adults. These individuals, however, used a significantly higher number of services provided through the HIV network (mean of 2.61 services) compared to the aging network (mean of .68 services). Predictors for service use varied across systems. While the primary predictor of HIV service use was awareness, Medicaid eligibility, & living arrangements were predictive of use of services from the aging network. 5 Tables, 30 References.

An Application of Borrayo's Cultural Health Belief Model to HIV/AIDS Seropositive Hispanics Living along the US/Mexico Border

Author: Keesee, Marguerite1; Ahmad, Ahmad Saleem G; Nelson, Wendy; Barney, David D; Duran, Elizabeth S1 U Oklahoma Center Health Ethics/Reseach/Policy, Norman mkeesee@ou.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61505732?accountid=14925

Abstract: This qualitative study examines the factors that led Hispanic men & women residing along the US/Mexico border to be tested for HIV. These factors were identified by applying Borrayo's (1999) Cultural Health Belief Model (CHBM) for Hispanics using grounded theory methodology. Participants consisted of 32 individuals receiving services from five HIV/AIDS demonstration sites in four states along the US/Mexico border. Results indicate partial support for Borrayo's Cultural Health Belief Model. Results also indicate that Hispanic male participants tended to be directly involved in risky behaviors while the female participants were generally monogamous & unaware of their vulnerability to exposure through the risk behaviors of their male partners. 2 Figures, 42 References.

Perceptions of Vulnerability to HIV among Older African American Women: The Role of Intimate Partners

Author: Winningham, April1; Richter, Donna; Corwin, Sara; Gore-Felton, Cheryl1 Center AIDS Intervention Research, Medical Coll Wisconsin, Milwaukee

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61509218?accountid=14925

Abstract: This is one of the first studies among older African American women to examine partner communication & perceived risk for HIV. Understanding that the vast majority of older women are infected through heterosexual contact, this study investigated several partner-related factors associated with perceptions of vulnerability to HIV among older African American women (age range = 50-81 years). A cross-sectional survey was conducted (n = 167) in three rural counties in SC. Perceptions of vulnerability to HIV was most strongly associated with women who were not married, believed that their sexual partner would not approve of using condoms, & had more comfort in communicating with their partners about sex. Recognizing the role of intimate partners in predicting women's perceptions of their own vulnerability to HIV is an important factor to consider when developing HIV prevention programs for older African American women. Future studies need to examine factors associated with effective partner communication, particularly negotiation strategies around condom use among older adults. 3 Tables, 46 References.

A Multiple-Family Group HIV Prevention Program for Drug-Involved Mothers and Their Young Children

Author: DeVoe, Ellen R1; Dean, Kara; Joyce, Emily; McKay, Mary M1 School Social Work, Columbia U, New York, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61541648?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article describes the development of a family-based preventive intervention designed to reduce HIV risk behavior in children (8-11 years) whose mothers have a history of drug involvement. The program, HIV-Prevention at the Young Mother's Program with Evolving Families (HYPE), is a 10-week multiple family group intervention influenced by the Collaborative HIV-Prevention & Adolescent Mental Health Project (CHAMP), a family-based HIV prevention program developed to reduce HIV risk behavior & promote mental health of urban pre-adolescents. The development & delivery of HYPE were overseen by a partnership between community members representing an inner-city neighborhood, including staff, administrators, & a graduate of a drug treatment program for mothers in Bronx, New York, & university-based researchers. A description of the collaborative process & an overview of the curriculum from the first pilot program are presented. Implications for family-based HIV prevention for urban populations affected by drug-use & abuse are discussed. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

Public Sex, HIV Prevention and Law Enforcement

Abstract: A sample of 98 men who cruised for sex in public places completed survey questionnaires related to: public sex background, HIV testing, interaction with police, HIV risk behaviors, & demographic information. Fifty-two percent had their first public sex encounter between the ages of 13-23, 76% had been tested for HIV, 15% were HIV positive, 27% had been arrested, & some men engage in sexual behaviors that pose a significant risk for HIV & other sexually transmitted infections, e.g., anal sex w/o condoms. However, outreach efforts & harm reduction methods, where individuals are taught to reduce harmful behaviors, appear to have helped some research participants engage in better decision-making regarding public sex encounters. Continued intervention efforts are needed to assist men who have sex with men (MSM) in making healthful decisions in public sex environments. 3 Tables, 25 References.

Midlife Women with HIV: Health, Social, and Economic Factors Shaping Their Futures

Author: Keigher, Sharon M1; Stevens, Patricia E; Plach, Sandra K1 Helen Bader School Social Welfare, U Wisconsin, Milwaukee keigher@uwm.edu

Abstract: Women are the fastest growing population infected with HIV. They are more impoverished, less healthy, & they succumb to AIDS faster than men. Even in WI, a relatively low prevalence state, HIV/AIDS is a significant cause of morbidity & death for women, especially women of color. However, with improved antiretroviral medications & clinical care, many women diagnosed today with HIV will live into old age. What are their prospects for "successful aging?" This essay presents qualitative data on 9 midlife WI women living with HIV to speculate about the probable trajectories & outcomes of their life-courses, highlighting their key security & longevity challenges. Financial resources, social support, health care, & health needs will be critical to their prospects for survival. Only by strengthening basic social provisions for many marginalized groups in the US will women with HIV have the prospect of sharing a future of "successful aging" that many other Americans take for granted. 1 Table, 22 References.

Abstract: Grounded theory was used to explore barriers to care & unmet needs for HIV-positive women caring for children under 18 years of age. The main study group consisted of 40 HIV-positive women caring for children. There were 21 Latinas, 11 Euro-Americans, 6 African Americans, & 2 participants from other ethnic groups. In addition, 5 providers of HIV services were interviewed to ensure trustworthiness of the data. The main findings identify & discuss needs for: (1) mental health & addiction services, (2) a better understanding of professional & paraprofessional roles, (3) improved privacy & confidentiality, (4) improved cultural sensitivity, & (5) other support service gaps outlined & discussed in this study. 26 References.

"Making It Manageable": Custody Planning with HIV-Affected Families

Author: Mason, Sally1; Vazquez, Deborah1 Instit Juvenile Research, Dept Psychiatry, U Illinois, Chicago smason@psych.uic.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61520599?accountid=14925

Abstract: Custody planning programs for HIV-infected parents help families overcome the obstacles to making future plans for their children, in the event of the parent's debilitating illness or death. In order to understand the social work intervention, progress notes from the Family Options Project, a custody planning program, were analyzed for themes regarding: (1) methods used by the social workers & (2) the content discussed with birth parents. The social workers used problem-solving methods that helped parents examine & partialize problems & explore solutions. Content centered on planning options, parent mental & physical health, & family relationships, reflecting the complexities of planning with HIV-affected families. As people with HIV are living longer, custody planning & family preservation have become equally important outcomes for the program. 2 Tables, 21 References. Adapted from the source document.

Reconciling Successful Aging with HIV: A Biopsychosocial Overview

Author: Vance, David E1; Robinson, F Patrick1 Edward R. Roybal Center Research Applied Gerontology, U Alabama, Birmingham devance@uab.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61516194?accountid=14925

Abstract: As HIV is increasingly viewed as a chronic condition, primary care clinicians, case managers, & researchers must address the emerging implications of aging with this disease. Many aspects of HIV overlap with similar aspects of the aging process; however, a synthesis of topics related to both phenomena reveals some unique influences on disease prognosis, which affect the social, psychological, & medical well-being of persons aging with this disease. Fortunately, the gerontological literature is replete with theories, models, & examples of how to age successfully. This literature can inform the topic of aging with HIV in order to provide direction for research, interventions, & services. Trends found within both aging & HIV contexts are used to predict potential difficulties in cognitive decline, depression, social withdrawal, financial planning, immune dysfunction, & mitochondria damage. To understand the biopsychosocial mechanisms surrounding successful aging with HIV, mitochondria damage is used to illustrate the dynamic effects of physical, psychological, & social functioning on each other. Interventions & questions for further research in successful aging with HIV are presented. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 88 References. Adapted from the source document.

The Use of Timelines in Illustrating the Permanency Planning Process for Families Infected/Affected by HIV/AIDS

Author: Palmer, Michelle1; Zobel, Melissa1 Consortium Child Welfare's FTP, Washington, DC Mpalmer@Familytiesproject.org

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61554156?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Family Ties Project (FTP) is a multi-agency, collaborative, federally funded demonstration project whose mission is to promote & preserve the well-being of District of Columbia (DC) children, youth, & families affected by HIV/AIDS by working with parents & caregivers to plan for the future care of their children. FTP was first funded in 1996 through the federal Administration for Children, Youth & Families (ACYF) as part of a national grant program to reduce the burden of infants & children abandoned or orphaned as the result of AIDS related illnesses. This article demonstrates the use of timelines in clinical practice. Timelines of the permanency planning process of three families who experienced a maternal death are presented to help illustrate the similarities & differences in the process for each of these families. Additionally, the authors discuss the implications for social work practice as they relate to client/family engagement, length of intervention, interdisciplinary collaboration within the HIV/AIDS service delivery system, & the use of timelines as a clinical tool. 3 Graphs, 13 References.

Voices Less Heard: HIV-Positive African American Women, Medication Adherence, Sexual Abuse, and Self-Care

Author: Gant, Larry M1; Welch, Leseliey A1 School Social Work, U Michigan, Ann Arbor Lmgant@umich.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61527516?accountid=14925

Abstract: As the HIV infection rate among African American women steadily increases, the body of research focusing on the lives, health, & concerns of HIV-positive African American women remains insufficient. Through primarily qualitative techniques, this study aims to gain insight into the health issues & concerns of HIV-positive African American women. Focus groups with small numbers of HIV-positive African American women were conducted to understand what factors strengthen & weaken medication adherence for women, determine what women's needs are about these issues, & to find out how medical community & service providers can help meet women's needs about adherence. Results from a series of face-to-face interviews with 98 HIV-positive African American women provided insights on how women with HIV & AIDS take care of themselves, & to what extent various life experiences & events influence self-care & adherence. Focus group findings identified factors that weaken & strengthen current medication adherence. Focus group participants also made several recommendations for future adherence strategies & tactics. Face-to-face interviews demonstrate the impact of substance use & past sexual abuse upon women's efforts to adhere to medication & treatment regimens. Implications & recommendations derived from the analysis provide suggestions for enhancing medication adherence strategies. Enhancing methods of increasing adherence rates for medical & human service professionals can improve support services for African American women living with HIV & AIDS. 4 Tables, 2 Figures, 69 References.

Abstract: This pilot study describes a cognitive intervention designed to compensate for cognitive deficits among persons with HIV/AIDS aged 50 & over. Seventeen participants were screened for memory & executive function deficits. Ten participants received the intervention, based on Spaced Retrieval (SR) & use of external memory aids. At two months post-treatment, all participants reported that the intervention helped them meet two self-selected functional goals (eg, remembering to take medications, remembering clinic appointments) & the majority successfully learned & retained the correct memory strategy. Spaced Retrieval, coupled with external aids, has potential for helping persons with HIV adhere to treatment regimens. 4 Tables, 47 References. Adapted from the source document.

Predictors of Successful Return to Work from HIV-Related Disability

Author: DiClementi, Jeannie D1; Ross, Mary K; Mallo, Connie; Johnson, Steven C1 Dept Psychology, Indiana-Purdue U, Fort Wayne

Abstract: This study examines factors distinguishing HIV-infected persons who successfully return to work (RTW) from those who do not. Records were obtained from 135 participants in a return to work program; these were matched with the records of 135 persons who did not return to work. Matching was made on the basis of age, gender, race, CD4 counts, & length of time in treatment. The return to work group had a greater total number of mental health diagnoses than the non-return group; however, when type of diagnosis was controlled for, the non-return group had greater numbers of substance use disorders. It appears that substance use disorders precludes a successful return to the workforce, while accessing the mental health treatment system may actually facilitate a return to work. Careful psychosocial assessment of clients on entry into the primary care clinic can aid referrals directly into a RTW program or into services that would facilitate an eventual return to work. 2 Tables, 12 References.

Psychological Distress Patterns of Women and Mothers Presenting for HIV-Related Mental Health Care

Author: Reece, Michael1; Basta, Tania B; Koers, Erin1 Dept Applied Health Science, Indiana U, Bloomington mireece@indiana.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61512761?accountid=14925

Abstract: Over a seven year period, data were collected from 228 women living with HIV upon their self-enrollment into mental health care at an HIV-related mental health clinic. Analyses were conducted to explore the symptoms of mental health distress being presented by women upon their enrollment into care &, in particular, associations between these symptoms & characteristics of motherhood. Findings suggest that women living with HIV present for care with significant levels of psychological distress symptoms & that factors related to parenthood are associated with diverse clinical presentations. As an increasingly prevalent component of the HIV social services system, women living with HIV are in need of access to services that are responsive to their unique mental health issues & that are based upon an understanding of the extent to which familial variables influence psychological distress. 2 Tables, 46 References.

HIV and Violence: An Agency-Based Investigation of Behavioral Patterns Associated with Clients Experiencing Current or Past Violence

Author: Herman, Lorette1; Mutchler, Matt G1 AIDS Project Los Angeles lorette@verizon.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61492375?accountid=14925

Abstract: Many men & women living with HIV/AIDS are also dealing with current or past violence. HIV/AIDS services agencies would benefit from understanding the relationship & impact of violence & abuse on their specific client population. AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA), an HIV prevention, advocacy & service agency for those living with & at risk of HIV, decided to investigate client intake questions regarding violence to determine if there were any behavioral patterns associated with those clients who stated they had or were currently living with violence. Substance abuse was an issue in many of those with a history of domestic violence. The implication of this study is that substance abuse, domestic violence & HIV/AIDS programs need to work collaboratively to address these intertwined issues. 1 Table, 3 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61523227?accountid=14925

Abstract: One-time telephone interviews were conducted with six middle-aged & older HIV-positive advocates who spoke about their views on the intersection of AIDS & aging. Despite their diversity, the participants spoke similarly about support, stigma, activism, health maintenance, the difficulty of separating the effects of HIV from the effects of aging, & a renewed gratitude about life & love.

Ryan and Jeanne White: Accidental Advocates

Author: Poindexter, Cynthia Cannon11 Fordham U Graduate School Social Service

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61520554?accountid=14925

Abstract: A discussion of Ryan White & his mother, Jeanne, in light of the upcoming re-authorization of the Comprehensive AIDS Resource Emergency Act. Ryan, a boy with hemophilia who first displayed symptoms of AIDS at the age of 13, became a symbol of the need for that Act. A number of themes in Ryan's life are discussed: facing & fighting the stigma of AIDS; the desire for normalcy; involuntary activism & fame; & being transformed by the experience, especially as he became an articulate advocate & became more aware of the intertwining of AIDS stigma & homophobia. Jeanne White, Ryan's mother, also became of vocal advocate for the rights & needs of people with AIDS. Themes in her life include the transition through phases of caregiving; involuntary activism & fame; being transformed by the experience; & facing & feeling grief. Together, Ryan and Jeanne set an example of how to deal with AIDS in a way that emphasizes action, compassion, & justice. 1 Reference. C. Ong-Dean

Providing Non-Traditional Mental Health Services to Individuals Living with HIV and AIDS: An Evaluation of Five Pilot Programs in Massachusetts

Author: Drainoni, Mari-Lynn1; Johnson, Victoria; McGuire, Jean Flatley; Gerlus, Reginalde1 Center Health Quality/Outcomes/Economic Research, ENRM Veterans Hospital, Bedford, MA drainoni@bu.edu

Abstract: The social work model of care is well suited for serving clients with complex mental health & medical issues, including HIV/AIDS. In this article, we present results from an evaluation of five demonstration programs that were established to use professional social workers to provide nontraditional mental health services for individuals living with HIV/AIDS. The results of the evaluation indicate that clients need a range of services that are often not reimbursable through insurance coverage, that it is important to provide services in alternative settings, & that the role of the social worker & the relationship between clinician & consumer are key to the success of the model. 2 Tables, 19 References.

Child Care Arrangements of Children Orphaned by HIV/AIDS: The Importance of Grandparents as Kinship Caregivers

Author: Cook, Judith A1; Boxer, Andrew M; Burke, Jane; Cohen, Mardge H; Weber, Kathleen; Shekarloo, Proshat; Lubin, Heidi; Mock, Lynn Owens1 Mental Health Services Research Program, Dept Psychiatry, U Illinois, Chicago cook@ripco.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61543302?accountid=14925

Abstract: This study examined the residential & custody status of children whose mothers were deceased participants in the Chicago Consortium of the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). Data were collected on 53 minor children. At follow-up, 77% of children lived with family, the residential status of 15% was unknown, & 8% lived in foster care or with a non-relative. Less than 25% of child care arrangements were formalized through legal procedures prior to mothers' deaths. Despite lack of formalized planning or financial assistance, children's relatives (especially grandparents) kept families together, preventing most motherless children from entering the child welfare custodial system.

Social-Environmental Influences on HIV Risks: Implications for HIV Prevention

Author: Bhattacharya, Gauri11 School Social Work, U Illinois, Urbana-Champaign gbhattac@uiuc.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61520281?accountid=14925

Abstract: To succeed, HIV prevention programs need to target the multiple factors, at both the individual & social-environmental levels, that have been found to influence HIV risk behaviors & outcomes. An ecological perspective grounded in a population-based public health model is proposed as a conceptual framework for HIV prevention. An overview is presented of the individual-level & social-environmental factors that the empirical literature has documented as influences upon HIV risk behaviors. The proposed framework has a number of implications for social work education, research, training, & policy. This framework calls upon social workers to learn a broad range of cross-disciplinary professional skills, become competent at working with a multidisciplinary team, continually update their knowledge of the ever-changing epidemic, receive organizational support for ongoing training, & obtain critically needed support from policymakers for comprehensive HIV prevention programs. 1 Table, 1 Figure, 42 References.

Measuring HIV Services Integration Activities

Author: Messeri, Peter1; Kim, Stephanie; Whetten, Kathryn1 Mailman School Public Health, Columbia U, New York, NY

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61508782?accountid=14925

Abstract: Despite efforts for more than four decades to better integrate the delivery of health & human services, particularly for individuals with problems that cross service sectors, such as HIV, our understanding remains limited as to what successful services integration (SI) strategies look like & whether they translate into improved client health & well being. One obstacle to expanding our knowledge of SI is the absence of a conceptual vocabulary & corresponding measures that delineate the salient features that allow us to compare & contrast the many concrete forms of SI initiatives. Drawing on past research literature, this article presents a conceptual taxonomy for classifying different components of SI initiatives. We present operational measures for the concepts in the taxonomy & illustrate their application for a comparative analysis of services integration activities implemented by 34 HIV service demonstration projects. 7 Tables, 38 References.

Stage of HIV-Infection and Social Support Networks: Gay and Bisexual Men's Embeddedness with Family, Friends, and Partners

Author: Vandehey, Michael A1; Shuff, I Michael; Diekhoff, George M1 Midwestern State U, Wichita Falls, TX michael.vandehey@mwsu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61517098?accountid=14925

Abstract: Previous research on social support networks of HIV-infected persons has reported differences in amount of social contact (embeddedness) across stages of illness. In the present study, 75 HIV-infected gay & bisexual males from a statewide, Midwestern sample listed up to nine social support providers & rated their frequency of contact & perceived level of social supportiveness with each person. Comparisons were made between the frequency of contact with social supports at each stage of illness (asymptomatic, symptomatic, & AIDS) & at initial, 1-year, & 2-year time intervals. Frequency of contact was similar across the stages of illness & over time. Furthermore, 'very supportive' ratings increased from 76% to 81% over the two-year time period despite an increase in AIDS diagnoses. It is concluded that progression of the illness does not guarantee reduced contact with or lowered positive perceptions of social relations. 5 Tables, 43 References. Adapted from the source document.

Treatment Adherence among Clients in AIDS Service Organizations

Author: Demmer, Craig11 Dept Health Services, Lehman Coll, CUNY, Bronx cdemmer@lehman.cuny.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61548090?accountid=14925

Abstract: For social workers in AIDS service organizations (ASOs), helping clients adhere to antiretroviral therapies is a priority, since non-adherence can significantly reduce drug efficacy & lead to drug resistance. This preliminary study examined treatment adherence among HIV-infected individuals receiving services from four ASOs in New York City. Adherence was suboptimal; more than one half of the sample had not taken their medications as prescribed within the past month & 20% had missed taking one or more pills the previous day. Clients who reported greater adherence considered themselves to be in good emotional health, had not used illegal drugs recently, & believed that their ASO was very helpful with regard to treatment adherence. Regular assessment of clients' treatment adherence is essential & social workers should continue to be involved with other health professionals in designing, implementing, & evaluating interventions for promoting adherence among clients in ASOs. 4 Tables, 26 References.

Risky Sexual Behaviors and HIV/Disease Knowledge of Injection Drug Users Attending Needle Exchange Programs: A Call for Additional Interventions

Author: Ksobiech, Kate11 Urban Studies Program, U Wisconsin, Milwaukee kksobiec@mcw.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61505625?accountid=14925

Abstract: A meta-analysis of worldwide Needle Exchange Program research was conducted with 14 studies, looking at the impact of needle exchange programs (NEPs) on the sexual risk behaviors & HIV/disease knowledge of injection drug users. Based on the limited data available to date (a total of 14 studies), two conclusions were drawn. First, HIV/disease knowledge does increase with NEP attendance. Second, risky sexual behaviors do not appear to decrease with NEP attendance, & may in fact increase. Neither of these areas has been investigated nearly as often as risky drug behaviors among NEP attenders. Focusing on disease knowledge & reducing risky sexual behaviors of NEP clients are both key areas for AIDS Service Organization staff to consider when developing HIV risk reduction interventions for injection drug users (IDUs). 3 Tables, 54 References.

When Spider Webs Unite: The Work of Volunteers in Providing Home-Based Care in Namibia

Author: Steinitz, Lucy Y11 Catholic AIDS Action, Windhoek, Namibia lucy@caa.org.na

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61507372?accountid=14925

Abstract: Resource-limited countries with high rates of infection face the biggest challenges in addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, as government & nongovernmental infrastructures are often undeveloped & slow to shift their focus away from nation-building & other perceived priorities to scale up their response to HIV/AIDS. This article examines the role of trained volunteers who provide Home-Based Family Care in the high-HIV-prevalence, resource-limited country of Namibia in Southern Africa. While each volunteer alone can make only a small difference, an organization that effectively uses many volunteers can make a large impact. Special focus is given to the experience -- & potential -- of churches to recruit, train, & help sustain volunteers to provide AIDS care & support. The case example of Catholic AIDS Action in Namibia -- that country's largest nongovernmental organization dedicated to HIV-related prevention & care -- is used to illustrate key points. The article concludes with "lessons learned" that can be applied to other nongovernmental & faith-based providers who seek to recruit & involve volunteers in the provision of direct-care services. 1 Table, 1 Appendix, 18 References.

African American Women, AIDS, and Resiliency

Author: Weinberg, Beth A1; Simoni, Jane M1 Ferkauf Graduate School Psychology, Yeshiva U baweinberg@aol.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61556402?accountid=14925

Abstract: Ongoing shifts in the populations affected by the AIDS epidemic are reflected in the increasing proportion of AIDS cases in women -- particularly women of color. While African American women represent approximately 13% of the US female population, in 2000, 63% of all reported AIDS cases in women in the United States were among African American/non-Hispanic women. Despite these statistics, relatively few studies in the area of HIV research target African American women exclusively. As part of a larger study, we asked 105 African American women to describe in their own words how their lives have changed since becoming HIV positive. Despite multiple past & current stressors, the majority of participants provided responses that were decidedly positive. Clinical implications as well as future research directions based on these findings are discussed. 23 References. Adapted from the source document.

Abstract: Fathers of HIV-infected children are rarely targeted as a group for specific psychosocial support & intervention. This paper is intended to provide an in-depth case description of a specific telephone group intervention & its perceived effectiveness by group members. Themes covered during the group intervention included diagnosis disclosure, coping, relationship issues, stigma, need for social & concrete support, medical care, & losses. The group was perceived to be effective in bringing together fathers of HIV-infected children. The fathers came from geographically diverse regions & without the group they might not have the opportunity to talk openly with others. All of the participants believed the group to be a valuable resource & would recommend it to others. The findings suggest that this is a cost-effective intervention that provides support to people who are either geographically distanced from each other or who are not emotionally ready to participate in a face-to-face support group. 31 References.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496851?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article expands on a technique used in educational & clinical settings to stimulate the creative imaginations of practitioners & persons living with HIV/AIDS. By jolting us out of our ruts of ordinary perception, the use of visuals with clients & colleagues leads to new awareness, the generation of creative options & problem-solving possibilities, increasing empathy & healing. A repertoire of case studies from the visual & literary arts & from popular culture is being compiled to elicit concerns, introduce concepts, enhance/build skills, explore attitudes, & to promote healing. The technique is offered as a practice tool & readers are invited to submit responses, examples, & images from their own experience. 5 Figures, 10 References. Adapted from the source document.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61449225?accountid=14925

Abstract: The article reports on findings from an exploratory survey of 25 HIV/AIDS workers. The survey instrument included all items from the five main dimensions of stresses & rewards in the AIDS Impact Scale, in addition to a series of open-ended questions. The findings suggested the need for careful review of the items to ensure they adequately capture current day stresses & rewards of HIV/AIDS work & the possible need for an additional dimension that captures the stresses & rewards of working with multi-problem vulnerable clients & their families. 2 Tables, 48 References.

Responding to Employment Needs: Strategies for Supporting Individuals with HIV/AIDS

Author: Timmons, Jamie Ciulla1; Fesko, Sheila Lynch1 Instit Community Inclusion, U Massachusetts, Boston ajtimmons@earthlink.net

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61449046?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article reports on a study investigating employment-related support to individuals with HIV/AIDS from the perspective of service providers. Surveys were completed by AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs) & Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) administrators & counselors that examined the extent to which support around employment was provided, the type of work-related services delivered, & outreach practices offered to this population. Findings indicated that although employment is becoming an increasingly important concern to this population, service providers have a limited capacity to respond to such needs. Strategies are presented for social workers & other professionals to consider as they work to support individuals with HIV/AIDS with employment-related concerns. 1 Table, 22 References.

Rural HIV/AIDS Services: Participant and Provider Perceptions

Author: Roeder, Kevin R11 Social Work Professional Program, U Wisconsin, Green Bay

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61548884?accountid=14925

Abstract: An exploratory study to investigate the needs of those living with HIV to determine related service challenges was conducted in 1997 & replicated in 1999. This study utilized qualitative & quantitative measures, surveyed both individuals who are living with HIV & HIV/AIDS service providers in predominately rural counties of a Midwestern state with a low incidence of HIV infection. Respondents' perceptions were solicited regarding existing services in the areas of: (1) awareness; (2) satisfaction; & (3) gaps & barriers. Findings indicate: (A) the critical role AIDS service organizations have in rural service delivery; (B) service awareness is much stronger among those living with HIV disease than HIV/AIDS service providers; (C) satisfaction with available services is growing; & (D) there is a widening gap between important needs & available services. 4 Tables, 24 References.

Mandalas as a Therapeutic Technique for HIV-Infected Children and Adolescents: What Do They Reveal?

Author: Wiener, Lori S1; Battles, Haven B1 National Cancer Instit, National Instits Health, Bethesda, MD wienerl@mail.nih.gov

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61546855?accountid=14925

Abstract: HIV positive children need a safe outlet to express their feelings about living with the virus. Creative therapeutic techniques such as the creation of mandalas (circle drawings) can facilitate the development of an emotional outlet. Carl G. Jung used mandalas in his work & believed that they are the paths to our center, the voice of our unconscious. The content of 32 mandalas created by children & adolescents living with HIV during clinical sessions with their social worker was analyzed for the themes expressed & colors utilized. The most prominent themes within the artwork concerned the concrete aspects of living with HIV. However, negative themes were balanced by themes concerning happiness, optimism, social relationships, & the normalcy of everyday life. The artwork illustrates that HIV plays a prominent role in the lives of the participants. Their resiliency is evidenced by the fact that nearly half of the themes expressed were positive & life affirming. 3 Tables, 1 Figure, 19 References. Adapted from the source document.

Ethnicity and Multiple Sex Partners: An Application of the Health Belief Model

Author: Neff, James Alan1; Crawford, Sharon L; MacMaster, Samuel A1 School Social Work, U Texas, Austin jneff@mail.utexas.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61449052?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Health Belief Model posits that risk behavior is influenced by perceptions of susceptibility & severity of risk, as well as perceived benefits & barriers to risk reduction. This study replicated & extended earlier analyses (Neff & Crawford, 1998), which found racial/ethnic differences in relationships between Health Belief Model variables & HIV risk behaviors. In the 1998 analysis, negative paths between susceptibility & risk behaviors among African American males were interpreted as "denial" of HIV risk. In the replication a self-report of number of sex partners served as a measure of HIV risk rather than the composite risk measure used previously. Analyses using this alternative risk measure do not indicate "denial" of risk. Susceptibility was positively related to number of partners in all racial groups. Indirect effects of susceptibility upon number of partners via alcohol disinhibition effects were found only among Mexican Americans, suggesting interventions should emphasize individual risk perceptions & alcohol expectancies. Understanding these relationships between race/ethnicity & HIV risk behaviors may help design culturally specific intervention & service programs. 2 Tables, 1 Figure, 35 References.

Emerging Roles for Persons Affected by HIV in Health Care Program Planning and Administration: Consumer Advisory Boards

Author: Rollet, Christine1; Winiarski, Mark G1 Dept Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, HIV Mental Health Research Group, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY crisrollet@aol.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496331?accountid=14925

Abstract: Involving HIV-affected consumers in meaningful advisory roles in a health care program, research planning, & administration now receives increased attention from funders & program developers. Establishing an advisory board is one common method for obtaining consumer input. While program managers may view an advisory board as cumbersome, benefits can be derived by programs & consumers. The experience of creating an advisory board, staffed by social workers, for a federally funded HIV mental health program in the south Bronx, provides lessons for social workers, program developers, & administrators regarding issues such as recruiting an unbiased panel, accommodating non-English speakers, management support of the board, & the coordination of several boards mandated by funders. 25 References.

The Role of Community in Meeting the Needs of African-American HIV-Affected Families

Author: Mason, Sally11 Dept Psychiatry, U Illinois, Chicago smason@psych.uic.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61498339?accountid=14925

Abstract: Using qualitative methods, university researchers enlisted the participation & collaboration of community residents to assess the service needs of HIV-affected families in an inner-city African American community with a high seroprevalence of HIV/AIDS. Community members infected with & affected by HIV/AIDS participated in interviews & reviewed & refined the preliminary findings. The participants were concerned by the lack of HIV/AIDS community services that were family-sensitive, ie, addressed the stresses & concerns of those people who provide support & care for a person with HIV. Participants identified community awareness & education as critical to serving those infected & affected. Denial & stigma in the community need to be addressed concurrently with the development of specific services for HIV-affected families. 20 References. Adapted from the source document.

Tuesdays with Fellow Travelers: A Psychoeducational HIV/AIDS-Related Bereavement Group

Author: Pomeroy, Elizabeth C1; Holleran, Lori K1 School Social Work, U Texas, Austin

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61496357?accountid=14925

Abstract: This project examined the effectiveness of a psychoeducational grief group intervention for AIDS-related death & bereavement. Family members & friends who had lost a loved one to HIV/AIDS participated in a six-week, time-limited bereavement group. Depression, anxiety, & grief reactions were analyzed using standardized instruments. Qualitative methods were also employed. Findings suggest that a psychoeducational bereavement group may be an effective intervention for caregivers who have unresolved emotional issues related to the loss of a loved one due to HIV/AIDS. 2 Tables, 35 References.

More than Shelter: Benefits and Concerns for People in HIV/AIDS Housing

Author: Smith, Laurie A1; Pynoos, Jon1 School Social Work, U Nevada, Las Vegas

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61540794?accountid=14925

Abstract: Housing people with HIV/AIDS is a pressing need as poor & disenfranchised groups are increasingly infected. Advocates, planners, & direct care workers lack information on the impact of HIV/AIDS housing from the perspective of residents. This study interviews 57 persons in subsidized housing solely for people with HIV/AIDS. Findings indicate that stable housing made significant contributions to improvements to the health, medication adherence, mental health, & social support of the residents. Problems noted in the housing include behavior associated with drug & alcohol abuse. Differences in social support gains by subgroups, particularly women, are also noted along with recommendations for increased housing availability using this & other models. 3 Tables, 14 References.

Serodiscordant Couples in the Age of Combination Therapies: Challenges and Coping Patterns

Author: Beckerman, Nancy L11 Wurzweiler School Social Work, Yeshiva U, New York, NY desilu@ix.netcom.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61429668?accountid=14925

Abstract: Serodiscordant couples have faced a number of challenges over the decades of HIV/AIDS. Combination therapies added hope to the survival of the HIV positive partner, but it also has created new challenges to intimacy. What are the unique challenges, dyadic conflicts, & ways of coping for these couples of mixed HIV status? This article reports on the findings from an exploratory study of twelve serodiscordant couples (both heterosexual & gay) from three different states, & five different AIDS organizations. The three emotional challenges to their relationship were identified as (1) the impact of side effects from medications, (2) safer sex conflicts, & (3) the decision-making process regarding reproductive issues & family planning. When asked how they coped, the primary source of psychological support was found in their friendships with other couples of mixed HIV status, couple counseling, & individual counseling. 23 References.

Author: Newman, Peter A.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62302993?accountid=14925

Abstract: Asserts that the social context of coming out may be vital to the overall psychological health and well-being of gay youth and to their HIV risk behavior. Coming out is a multifaceted developmental process. Interventions targeting anti-gay attitudes and behaviors in families, schools, and communities, in addition to combating discriminatory social policies, may be vital in HIV prevention for gay youth.

A Practice Tool for Dialogue about HIV and Social Services

Author: Bertman, Sandra L11 U Massachusetts Medical School sbertman@attbi.com

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61543262?accountid=14925

Abstract: This article presents a technique used by the author to stimulate the therapeutic imaginations of practitioners & persons living with HIV/AIDS in educational & clinical settings. Narrative responses to four visual case studies raise themes of intergenerational issues, coping with life-limiting illness, & caregiver burden allowing for enhancement of assessment & empathic skills. This method often leads to the generation of creative options & problem-solving possibilities. The technique is offered as a practice tool & readers are invited to submit responses, examples, & images from their own experience. 4 Figures, 5 References. Adapted from the source document.

Coming Out in a Hostile Social Environment: Challenges for HIV Prevention among Young Gay Men

Author: Newman, Peter A11 UCLA Neuropsychiatric Instit, Center Community Health, Los Angeles, CA panewman@ucla.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61498127?accountid=14925

Abstract: Young people under age 24 account for almost 50% of all new HIV infections in the US; young men who have sex with men are disproportionately represented among this population (Centers for Disease Control, 2000). The major assertions of this article are that (1) the social context of coming out may be vital to the overall psychological health & well-being of gay youth &, in turn, to their HIV risk behavior; & (2) coming out is a multifaceted developmental process -- different pathways of coming out may be related to different types & determinants of HIV risk behavior. Evidence of a milieu of stigmatization, antigay hatred, harassment, & violence among gay youth suggests that merely addressing HIV risk with even high-quality individual-level interventions that myopically focus on sexual behavior may be insufficient. Interventions targeting antigay attitudes & behaviors in families, schools, & communities, as well as combating discriminatory social policies & institutions, may be a vital aspect of HIV prevention among gay youth. 54 References.

HIV Prevention for Active Injection Drug Users: A Brief History of Syringe Exchange Programs

Author: MacMaster, Samuel A1; Womack, Bethany G1 Coll Social Work, U Tennessee, Nashville

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61538720?accountid=14925

Abstract: It is estimated that approximately 50% of all new HIV infections are related to injection drug use (Holmberg, 1996), as used syringes can harbor blood with traces of viable HIV for over 4 weeks (Abdala, Stephens, Griffith, & Heimer, 1999). Due to this concern, Syringe Exchange Programs (SEPs) & other related HIV prevention programs for active injection drug users have been developed & expanded in many urban areas of the US over the past 15 years. Based on the Harm Reduction model of service provision, SEPs seek to reduce the harm associated with injection drug use through the elimination of the primary means by which HIV risk is spread, the shared syringe. Despite extensive research supporting the efficacy of SEPs, significant barriers exist to the delivery of these services, as SEPs are often viewed as being outside the traditional continuum of care for HIV/AIDS &/or substance abuse. All social workers involved in HIV/AIDS services should be aware of these programs, & continued expansion & integration with other HIV/AIDS services should be a priority. 75 References.

"Twists and Turns": Case Study of an HIV Caregiving Journey

Author: Poindexter, Cynthia Cannon11 School Social Work, Boston U, MA ccp@bu.edu

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/61498157?accountid=14925

Abstract: Twists & turns are commonly felt by caregivers over the volatile trajectory of HIV disease; they report extraordinary challenges alongside existential transformations. This case study presents the complex experience of one HIV-affected mother who negotiated the psychological spaces of dying & caregiving while occupying the same physical space with a critically ill son during an extremely stressful & sad time. Comments from the research respondent are included as endnotes. This story raises questions about the nature of the care relationship & suggests the utility of story telling for HIV caregivers. 37 References. Adapted from the source document.
