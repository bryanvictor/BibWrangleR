http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62484727?accountid=14925

Abstract: Statewide study of 455 Ohio children who received family preservation or reunification services found that the homeless child was more likely to be a child of color, to be younger, to have problems maintaining a bond with parents, and to be in a relative's home, and less likely to have behavior problems or successful service outcomes.

Author: Magneson, Harland

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62509001?accountid=14925

Support Systems for Rural Families: Rationale, Strategies, and Examples.

Author: Thurston, Linda P.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62498954?accountid=14925

Abstract: Formal and informal support systems are essential to empowering rural families to meet basic needs of health, education, and employment. Formal resources (institutions, agencies, professionals) are often lacking in rural areas and families rely on informal resources (extended family, church, social clubs). Characteristics of informal social support systems are discussed, and public policy recommendations are suggested. Contains 53 references. (SAS)

Author: Morris, Lynne Clemmons

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62496871?accountid=14925

Abstract: Distance education has potential to overcome barriers to rural women's participation but must consider women's attitudes toward technology and ways of knowing. Strategies are outlined for developing gender-friendly models of distance education. "Value-added" distance education requires rethinking traditional instructional settings and techniques.

Author: Rogers, John; Smith, Marshall L.; Hull, Grafton H.; Ray, JoAnn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62497124?accountid=14925

Abstract: Survey of 2,006 graduates with at least a bachelor's degree in social work (BSW) (86% female, 88% White, average age 34) found that, compared to urban workers, rural social workers were more likely to be White; had fewer master's degrees and lower incomes; were more satisfied with their BSW preparation; and showed greater community involvement.

Rural Social Work Is an Anachronism: The Perspective of Twenty Years of Experience and Debate.

Author: Mermelstein, Joanne; Sundet, Paul A.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62491994?accountid=14925

Abstract: Draws on evidence concerning rural population, families, schools, churches, and communities to conclude that the conceptualization of rural as "different from urban" has no contemporary empirical support and that differences among rural areas are greater than rural-urban differences.

Measuring Rurality.

Author: Cleland, Charles L.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62509781?accountid=14925

Abstract: The Rurality Index measures community access to resources for resolution of local problems; includes physical, population, educational, and financial elements; and assesses community connections to the larger society and the global economy. Analysis found that U.S. metro counties were heavily skewed to the least rural end of the scale but overlapped somewhat with nonmetro counties. (LP)

Author: Bowd, Alan D.; Loos, Cynthia H.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62489058?accountid=14925

Abstract: An Ontario study of 68 caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease revealed that those respondents living in more remote areas of northwestern Ontario expressed greater needs for information, education, and social support; experienced significantly more difficulties with morale; and employed coping strategies that reflected an inadequate social support system. Contains 31 references. (LP)

The North Idaho Rural System of Care Project: Program Evaluation Findings.

Author: Ray, JoAnn

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62624578?accountid=14925

Abstract: A pilot system of individualized and rurally compatible community-based alternatives to residential and institutional treatment settings for seriously emotionally disturbed children was evaluated. The results indicate that this intensive, community-based, service-delivery system appears to improve children's behavioral and emotional functioning, and perhaps family functioning as well. (TD)

Using Community Agency Professionals in the Evaluation of Family Preservation Programs.

Author: Denning, Janice; Gibbons, Jacque

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62704564?accountid=14925

Abstract: Interviews with 74 rural community professionals assessed family preservation services available during a 2-year pilot project in 3 rural areas of Kansas and compared family preservation services to traditional child welfare services. Respondents viewed family preservation projects as highly valued services, focusing on the projects' informality, flexibility, use of home setting, and family advocacy. (RAH)

Abstract: Reports results of three gender expectations questions added to the Monitoring the Future Project questionnaires of 1977, 1983, and 1989, which were administered to high school seniors nationally. Findings from white rural teens indicate that their gender role expectations were changing but lagged behind social and economic realities. Males held more traditional attitudes than females.

Reentry into Emergency Shelter Care by Rural Youth.

Author: Van Hook, Mary

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62607404?accountid=14925

Abstract: Based on a records analysis, the rural youth at increased risk for reentering emergency shelters were adolescent females living in a step-family or female-headed household. Older children reentering care were unlikely to return home. Community-based services are needed to prevent the ongoing cycle of children in emergency shelters and subsequent out-of-home placements.

Mental Health Services: A Viable Alternative to Incarceration in a Rural State.

Author: Boyer, Patricia A.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62622741?accountid=14925

Abstract: Alternative sentencing becomes increasingly important as prisons become overcrowded, public monies become less available, and the positive influence of incarceration on recidivism cannot be demonstrated. A survey of 42 Wyoming probation officers examined the practices and problems involved in the utilization of mental health services as a form of alternative sentencing. (TD)

Offering a Part Time Bachelor of Social Work Degree in a Rural Area: A Sixteen Year Retrospective.

Author: Miller, Keith A.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62610640?accountid=14925

Abstract: Since 1977, the University of Wyoming has been developing methods of delivering its bachelor of social work program throughout its large, sparsely populated, rural state. New video telecommunication technology can reach all areas in the state with live, interactive teaching. This emerging program is unique and has implications for other universities seeking to provide off-campus degree programs in a rural context. (TD)

Chemical Dependency Content in CSWE Accredited BSW Programs: A Survey of Course Content and Implications for Further Curricula Development.

Author: Jarrett, Herbert H.; Howard, Mary C.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62706690?accountid=14925

Abstract: Reports on responses from 61 accredited baccalaureate programs of social work surveyed concerning inclusion of courses and instructional materials on alcoholism/chemical dependency in curricula, use made of 12-step programs and recovering people, and whether spirituality aspects were addressed. Concludes that content on alcoholism and chemical dependency is generally insufficient to prepare social workers for practice. (RAH)

Information for Educators and Policymakers Regarding the Health of America's Children.

Author: Thornburg, Kathy R.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62496818?accountid=14925

Abstract: Presents 11 recommendations related to improving child health that are based on a synthesis of 58 research reports published 1988-92. Suggests that the development of policies that reduce inadequate health care for women and children, unintended pregnancy, deficient education, and poor nutrition will ultimately improve the life circumstances, and therefore the health, of poor children. Contains 146 references. (LP)

Rural Dimensions of Homelessness: A Rural-Urban Comparison.

Author: Nooe, Roger M.; Cunningham, Maryanne Lynch

Abstract: Compared homelessness among persons in a metropolitan setting based on whether or not the person had migrated from a rural area. Found that those from rural areas had a lower level of educational achievement, experienced a higher degree of isolation from families, and frequently had come to the urban area seeking jobs. (KS)

Abstract: Interviews with 247 homeless families (including 480 children) in 21 rural Ohio counties found that over two-thirds were headed by young single females. The most frequently cited reasons for homelessness were family conflict or dissolution and economic factors. Implications for service provision and policy development are discussed. (LP)

Disability and Rural Independent Living: Setting an Agenda for Rural Rehabilitation.

Author: Offner, Richard

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62857223?accountid=14925

Abstract: Rural disability and rehabilitation services suffer from problems of equity and efficacy. The most relevant approach to rural human-services planning is one in which available resources are organized and managed to produce the best results. Barriers to rural rehabilitation include too few rehabilitation personnel, inadequate transportation, and few employment opportunities. (KS)

Preventing Secondary Conditions in Rural Areas: A Case Management Model.

Author: Seekins, Tom

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62862022?accountid=14925

Abstract: A rural model for preventing and managing secondary health problems involves workshops that empower adults with disabilities to better manage their own health, and the development of supportive community structures. Four Montana case studies suggest that this prevention model may enhance the health and independence of rural adults with disabilities. (KS)

Company Town: Beyond the Legacy.

Author: Bedics, Bonnie C.; Doelker, Richard E.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62773878?accountid=14925

Abstract: Research indicates that living in company towns created a population lacking in initiative and self-determination. In one community that was a company town until the mid-1950s, key-informant interviews indicated high levels of dropping out, illiteracy, teen pregnancy, poverty, and dependency. However, a survey of high school students revealed no indications of dependency or helplessness. (LP)

A Rural Community's Reactions to the Deinstitutionalization of Psychiatric Patients.

Author: Hall, Barry L.

http://search.proquest.com.proxy.lib.wayne.edu/docview/62856619?accountid=14925

Abstract: A survey of 523 households in a rural Alberta (Canada) town found that overall, the community supported deinstitutionalization of patients from the town's psychiatric hospital. The strongest predictor of favorable attitudes toward the mentally ill was education, whereas age, employment status, and income were weak predictors. (KS)
