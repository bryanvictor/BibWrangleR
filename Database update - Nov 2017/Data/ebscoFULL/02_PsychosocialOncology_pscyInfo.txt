AB- This article first highlights how deficiencies in communication between health care professionals and cancer patients adversely affect psychological adjustment. Reasons for these deficiencies and the use of communication skills training to overcome them are then discussed. Finally, we consider how specialist cancer nurses trained in such skills can play a key role in improving psychological care providing they are given adequate training, supervision and support.

AB- Objective: In this cross-sectional study, we tested whether the coping styles of emotional suppression and fighting spirit were associated with mood disturbance in cancer patients participating in professionally led community-based support groups even when demographic, medical, and group support variables were taken into account. Methods: A heterogeneous sample of 121 cancer patients (71% female, 29% male) completed the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS), the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (Mini-MAC), a measure of perceived group support, and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results: Con- sistent with hypotheses, lower emotional suppression and greater adoption of a fighting spirit, in addition to older age and higher income, were associated with lower mood disturbance. Gender, time since diagnosis, presence of metastatic disease, time in the support group, perceived group support, cognitive avoidance, and fatalism were unrelated to mood disturbance. Conclusion: Expression of negative affect and an attitude of realistic optimism may enhance adjustment and reduce distress for cancer patients in support groups.

AB- Objective: In this cross-sectional pilot study of couples in whom the man was diagnosed with prostate cancer or the woman with breast cancer, the purpose was to identify and compare the variables that characterize couples where both spouses are in high psychological distress with couples where the psychological distress of both spouses is within the normal range. Methods: Psychological distress and perception of family support in 574 individuals (118 consecutive prostate cancer patients and their spouses, and 169 randomly selected breast cancer patients and their spouses) were assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the Perceived Family Support (PFS) self-report questionnaires. Results: Couples experiencing high psychological distress reported lower levels of perceived family support than couples in whom both spouses reported normal levels of psychological distress. Conclusion: The findings support the notion that perceived family support is associated with the psychological distress in both patients and spouses.

AB- The purpose of this study was to (1) assess the quality of life (QOL) of the primary caregivers of hospice patients and (2) to analyze the ability of the hospice staff to accurately judge caregiver QOL. A longitudinal pilot study of QOL of 57 caregivers and patients entering hospice was conducted. Caregivers and hospice personnel completed numerous questionnaires every 2 weeks until patient death. Global QOL and component constructs, as well as the demands of illness on the caregiver and profile of moods, were assessed. Simple descriptive statistics at each time point and summary measures (area under the curve) were calculated to describe the QOL profile of caregivers and staff perceptions of the caregivers. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was applied to verify tool internal consistency in a hospice population. Correlation coefficients were supplemented by Bland-Altman procedures for comparing scales measuring the same construct to compare the scores given by caregivers about themselves and staff ratings of the caregivers. The study had 80% power to detect an intracase difference between caregiver and staff ratings of the caregiver of 0.4 times the standard deviation using a two-sided paired t test with a 5% type 1 error rate. Caregiver QOL was relatively high and stable over time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Objective: The aim of this pilot/feasibility study was to describe the experience of women presenting with a suspicious mammogram who are waiting for a breast biopsy and to identify those at risk for distress. Methods: Participants (n=25) were interviewed at two time points: immediately after being put on the waiting list (T1) and again immediately before their biopsy approximately 6 weeks later (T2). Self-report measures of distress and coping were used. Perceived personal risk of a positive biopsy finding and information needs were assessed through open-ended questions. Results: Distress levels were high in this sample. Using cognitive-avoidant coping strategies, being employed, history of previous biopsies, and having a family history of breast cancer were associated with greater distress. Perceived personal risk of a positive biopsy finding was overestimated in one half of the cases and was correlated with greater distress. Conclusion: Waiting period between suspicious mammogram and breast biopsy may be a time of high distress for many women.

AB- Objective: The purpose of this paper is to describe pretest psychological functioning in a sample of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients undergoing genetic testing. We also explored the relationship among demographic, medical, family history and loss variables and current pretest distress, and those related to anticipated posttest distress. Methods: This paper reports pretest findings from a prospective, longitudinal psychosocial survey. Data are presented on 220 CRC patients at pretest. Results: We found a subgroup of CRC patients that are currently distressed and anticipate becoming depressed if they receive a positive genetic test result. There were significant associations among pretest distress, family history of CRC and loss related to CRC and anticipation of becoming depressed at posttest. Conclusions: The findings suggest that a subgroup of CRC patient's experience or anticipate distress that may warrant attention. Family history of CRC and losses related to CRC may be important indicators of posttest adjustment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The computerized quality of life (QL) screening literature is also briefly reviewed as potentially instructive. This review is followed by a theoretical and psychometric assessment of the various screening instruments and screening models that have been suggested in the literature or used clinically and a brief assessment of possible economic costs of psychosocial screening, ending with concrete suggestions for methods and models that could be widely adopted by psychosocial oncology programs.

SU- Bone Marrow; Neoplasms; Organ Transplantation; Physical Illness (Attitudes Toward); Self Concept
AB- The experience of cancer and its treatment by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can enhance the salience of one's status as a patient in the evolution of self-concept. Illness and the patient role can come to dominate the sense of self, resulting in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and distress ("engulfment"). Ninety allogeneic BMT outpatients completed the Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale, Modified Engulfment Scale, and a semantic differential measure of self-concept as a BMT patient in an interview context. Illness intrusiveness correlated significantly with engulfment and with self-concept as a BMT patient. Engulfment did not correlate significantly with self-concept as a BMT patient. Multiple regression analysis, controlling for relevant covariates, indicated a significant Illness Intrusiveness×Engulfment interaction effect on self-concept as a BMT patient. Self-concept as a BMT patient increases as cancer and its treatment introduce increasing lifestyle disruptions (illness intrusiveness). These effects are amplified when self-experience is dominated by disease and treatment and patients feel helpless, hopeless, and distressed (engulfment).

AB- Objective: This study evaluated the desire for hastened death (DHD) in cancer patients at varying stages of disease to determine its frequency and relationship to physical and psychological distress. Methods: Two hundred twenty-four inpatients at Princess Margaret Hospital completed questionnaires assessing pain, physical symptoms, depression, hopelessness, and DHD. Results: There was significant physical and psychological distress in this sample with a mean of nine physical symptoms reported by each subject. Seven percent reported moderate DHD on the Schedule of Attitudes Towards Hastened Death (SAHD) and 2% reported high DHD. Hopelessness and stage of disease were the only significant independent predictors of DHD and their interaction was associated with increased DHD. Hopelessness and, less so, depression both mediated the pathways between illness-related factors and DHD. Conclusions: Findings suggest that DHD is significantly related to hopelessness and advancing disease. Assessment of this phenomenon prior to the end of life may provide opportunities for intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Tested the effectiveness of a model intervention package developed to facilitate the successful school and social reintegration of children and adolescents newly diagnosed with cancer. 37 children (aged 5–17 yrs) completed the Perceived Competence Scale for Children and the Children's Depression Inventory before the intervention was initiated and again at follow-up (mean interim 8.87 mo). Data were also collected from parents, teachers, school records, and physicians. 36 age-matched controls who had been diagnosed within the 36 mo before initiation of the project were assessed once with identical psychological measures. Findings show that the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements following the intervention. Controls tended to exhibit poorer school and social adjustment than Ss; however, no group differences were found on grades or attendance. Results support early structured school and social reintegration interventions for newly diagnosed children who have cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Sequentially assigned 554 smokers (mean age 41.4 yrs) in 2 cohorts (Great American Smokeout and New Year's Day) who intended to quit smoking on their own without formalized external aid to a frequent-contact and an infrequent-contact group. All Ss completed a detailed baseline questionnaire and were followed for 12 mo. Findings revealed that neither frequency of interviews nor cohort affected outcome. The rate of nonsmoking at each follow-up point declined from 34% at 1 mo to 25% at 1 yr. 11% of Ss were continuous abstainers, 21% of Ss never stopped smoking, and 68% of Ss who ever quit had relapsed by 1 yr. Continuous abstainers were lighter smokers, less addicted, more aware of the health risks associated with smoking, more highly motivated to stop, more confident of their ability to do so, and more committed to quitting at baseline than other Ss.

SU- Emotional States; Mental Health Programs; Neoplasms; Pain
AB- Compared 39 high pain (HP) cancer patients and 23 low pain (LP) cancer patients on measures of mood disturbance. 20 HPs were randomly assigned to an intensive psychiatric intervention program. Results indicate that HPs scored significantly high on the Beck Depression Inventory; subscales of the Spielberger Depression Inventory; and subscales of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory reflecting strain, fright, and worry. On the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III), 28% of the HPs had a current diagnosis of major depression, whereas none of the LPs did. Findings confirm earlier reports (e.g., D. Spiegel [1986]) of a link between pain and mood disturbance in cancer patients. While follow-up data on the intervention were insufficient to permit useful analysis, the strong association between pain and depression at baseline suggests that the vigorous treatment of depression in the HPs assigned to treatment should result in improvements in both depression and pain.

AB- Analyzed practice issues involved in providing psychosocial services for patients of different sociocultural status in the context of empirical data from extant research and findings from a study by K. O. Ell et al (1987 [unpublished manuscript]; 1989) of 369 patients (aged 35+ yrs) with a 1st diagnosis of breast, colorectal, or lung cancer. Selected findings indicate that the duration of symptoms before the diagnosis varied by gender and socioeconomic status (SES), with men and lower SES Ss being more likely to have had symptoms for a longer time. Social integration decreased with advancing age and was lower among men, lower SES Ss, and less-educated Ss. Hispanics' perceived adequacy of support was lower than that of Whites and Blacks. Implications for assessment are discussed; intervention with men, the elderly, the poor, and ethnic minorities is emphasized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Ss' parents supplied each S's developmental history and completed the Deasy-Spinetta Behavioral Questionnaire (DSBQ) and the Adaptive Behavior Inventory for Children. Information was obtained from Ss' teachers via interviews and the DSBQ. Findings indicate that, as a group, CI Ss seemed to be at higher risk for subsequent behavioral problems than were NI Ss. There was a clear relationship between CI Ss' lower academic achievement scores, their apparent learning and information-processing deficits, and their social and adaptive difficulties.

AB- Discusses the scope and determinants of chemotherapy-related nausea, vomiting, and behavioral distress in pediatric cancer patients, focusing on anticipatory symptoms. Findings from a 3-yr prospective study of distress in children and adolescents receiving chemotherapy are summarized. It was found that the behavioral effects of chemotherapy on pediatric patients were determined by many factors and that their behavioral responses to chemotherapy may be best predicted on the basis of most recent experience rather than on usual distress levels. Adolescents experienced significantly higher levels of both anticipatory and postchemotherapy nausea and vomiting than did Ss less than 12 yrs old; their levels of anticipatory distress tended to increase over chemotherapy cycles, while younger Ss experienced decreases in anticipatory distress.

All Ss were aged 18–60 yrs. Results indicate that most Ss viewed themselves as healthy and cured of cancer at the time of the interview. Over 80% of the Ss had been debilitated as a result treatment, and for most Ss, the effects lasted an average of 9 mo after treatment. Problems included significant depletion of energy, increased fear of cancer, interference with sleep and cognitive function, and sexual difficulties. No significant differences were found between tumor types, and Ss' scores on psychological tests did not reflect significant levels of symptomatology in the sample as a whole.

The model is supported with (1) interview data from 53 cancer patients and their spouses over a 3-yr period to assess multiple aspects of psychosocial adaptation and coping and experiences of stigma and (2) survey data on 371 undergraduates' attitudes toward cancer using a stigma inventory. Variables that affect attitudes toward cancer and mediate patients' experiences of stigma are explored, including social support, coping styles, compliance with the medical regimen, and emotional factors. Findings are discussed in terms of the psychosocial morbidity phenomenon, focusing on role and family systems theories and the just world hypothesis.

SU- Emotional Adjustment; Family Relations; Terminal Cancer
AB- Administered the Current Adjustment Scale (CAS) in a follow-up study with 38 families of pediatric cancer patients 5 yrs after the children's treatment had ended and 13 families 5 yrs after the children had died. Findings revealed that families with the long-term cancer survivor generally had less difficulty adjusting than families whose child had died. A regression analysis, comparing the families' adjustment during the course of treatment with their adjustment 5 yrs later, confirmed the consistency of family functioning over time. A factor analysis of the CAS resulted in 3 factors associated with family adjustment: (1) the family was able to resolve questions about the cancer and focus on matters unrelated to the disease; (2) the family system was adaptive, healthy, and supportive of its members; and (3) family members were able to seek help when needed. Themes that helped differentiate families that had adjusted well from those that had not are discussed, and suggestions for interventions early in the course of treatment that may help families adjust better over time are offered.

AB- Investigated how 33 predominantly White, rural, Midwestern families with a child diagnosed as having cancer perceived, interpreted, and responded to childhood cancer. Intensive analysis of interviews with 5 families whose child had died and 5 families whose child had survived during the 5-yr study period revealed 15 themes, including being unprepared for the cancer diagnosis, the need to normalize family life as quickly as possible, fear that the cancer would recur, and fear that a sibling would develop the disease. Nursing interventions suggested by the themes are noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Interviewed 38 families in which multiple cancers had occurred. Findings indicate that Ss presented myriad problems, including financial struggles, marital discord, social isolation, depression, and substance abuse. Cancer was the focal point of life for most of the families. Ss expressed fears of dying, pain, afflicting their children, losing contact with others, and the future. In general, Ss were not provided with enough resources to sustain them emotionally, physically, or financially. Results suggest that every cancer patient should be asked about others in his/her immediate family who have or have had cancer to assess the full impact of the disease and to plan for supportive services. The need for a concerted effort to increase resources and services for these special families is emphasized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Compared the major psychosocial problems and needs of surviving cancer patients in California, where cancer patients are treated under an essentially private fee-for-service system of medical care, and in the western region of Sweden, where the system of universal health insurance and social benefits removes almost all economic consequences of the disease. 810 cancer patients and 142 family members in California and 406 cancer patients and 83 family members in Sweden were interviewed. Results identified the positive effects of each society's interventive actions. In California, individual and family services were more available than in Sweden, whereas economic supports were less available, resulting in more economic-related problems and fewer individual and family difficulties than in Sweden. However, patients in each society had some difficulties in both areas, which required further attention from the health care system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study evaluated the psychological effects of an outdoor adventure program on young adult cancer survivors (ages 18–39). The 6-day adventure program included personal instruction and supervision on the basics of kayaking, surfing, or climbing. Compared to a wait-list control group, participants who took part in the program for the first time had improved (relative to pretest) body image, self-compassion and self-esteem, and less depression and alienation. Participants who took part for the second time, though also helped by the program in similar ways, were no better off psychologically than participants who took part for the first time. Possible explanations for the positive effects and their apparent short duration are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Few studies have evaluated the impact of childhood cancer on parents’ occupational/financial status. This study explored parents’ occupational/financial experiences posttreatment. Semistructured interviews were administered to 78 parents (44 mothers) of childhood cancer survivors diagnosed in the preceding 5 years. Transcripts were organized into themes using QSR NVivo8. Parents reported familial, psychological, and practical factors affecting their ability to return to work. Prioritizing family, reinstigating career progression, and negative workplace attitudes were particularly challenging. Parents of children with cancer experience substantial work—family conflict after their child's physical recovery from cancer. Family friendly policies and further research are recommended.

AB- This study investigated memories of childhood leukemia conveyed by survivors belonging to a Latin culture, exploring whether benefit findings was spontaneously reported, as by non-Latin survivors. Three hundred patients previously treated for leukemia were contacted by post/e-mail and asked to write freely about their illness experience. The 106 letters received were analyzed for narrative structure and content, according to a grounded theory approach. Participants expressed most of the themes conveyed by childhood cancer survivors in non-Latin countries, and benefit finding was spontaneously reported. To the latter, the usefulness of creating and maintaining personal narratives on cancer experience, sustained by health care professionals, is discussed.

AB- The existential experiences associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment are well researched, but the posttreatment phase is relatively underexplored. Using semistructured interviews and theory-led thematic analysis this qualitative study investigated the existential experiences of eight cancer survivors who had successfully completed curative treatment. Being in remission had led to deep existential reflections (i.e., death anxiety, freedom, isolation, and meaning making), and some participants faced considerable challenges that affected their emotional well-being. Understanding cancer survivors’ existential challenges should enable health care professionals to engage with the emerging shift from the predominantly medically focused posttreatment care to a more holistic approach.

AB- This study aimed to investigate the predictors of benefit finding in 311 adult children of patients with cancer. Participants completed a comprehensive online/pen-and-paper survey measuring benefit finding, gender of parent, outcome and duration of illness, caregiving experience, and emotional experiences including reaction to diagnosis and grief and loss. Greater benefit finding was positively associated with stronger emotional experiences, satisfaction with the caregiving role, and outcome of parental cancer, explaining 15.3% of the variance in benefit finding. Higher emotional reactions and outcome of parental cancer as significant predictors of parental cancer provide some support for the applicability of theories of post-traumatic growth to this cohort.

AB- Security of attachment is described as an inner resource that may also facilitate the adaptation of individuals during critical life adversity, even when facing end-stage illness and death. This study assessed the relation between attachment styles, patient–caregiver reciprocal empathy, and patient–physician working alliance, in the terminal phase of an oncological disease. We hypothesized that the attachment security of patients, as measured by the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ), is related to the reciprocal empathy with the caregiver, as measured by the Perception of Partner Empathy (PPE) questionnaire, and to the working alliance with the physician, as measured by the Working Alliance Inventory–Short Form (WAI-S). Thirty-seven end-stage cancer patients, their caregivers, and physicians participated in the study. The PPE and WAI-S were administered twice: immediately after the hospice recovery and a week later. Results showed a significant improvement in patient–caregiver empathy and in patient–physician alliance after a week at the hospice. Findings indicated that the patients’ attachment style influenced their perception of reciprocal empathy with the caregiver and the working alliance with the physician. Patients with a secure attachment had a greater capacity to show empathic closeness with their caregivers and enjoyed a better working alliance with their physicians. Caregivers’ attachment security, otherwise, did not show the same influence on empathy and alliance. Findings support the hypothesis that patients’ attachment security plays a crucial role in the relation with their own caregiver and with the physician, even at the terminal phase. Theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are explored in the discussion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study examined the relationships of biological and psychosocial predictors as contributing factors to the psychological functioning among breast cancer survivors. A sample of (N = 155) African American breast cancer survivors were recruited from California. A general linear model was utilized to examine the relationships. Biological and psychosocial risk factors were significant predictors for anxiety and depression. These predictors can be viewed as contributing factors to the psychological well-being of this cohort. Anxiety and depression are often under-recognized and subsequently undertreated in survivors. Understanding the predictors of depression and anxiety is necessary for incorporating a multidisciplinary approach to address this problem.

AB- This study explored the psychosocial functioning of 10 head and neck cancer patient–caregiver dyads over the radiation/chemoradiation (radiation or combined chemoradiation) treatment period, including the interdependence in patient–caregiver quality of life (QOL). Dyads were recruited prior to or at the initiation of radiation/chemoradiation treatment. Patient QOL decreased across the treatment trajectory, and many caregiver QOL subscales decreased during the middle of treatment. Caregiver burden increased over the treatment trajectory with levels remaining relatively low. Patients and caregivers demonstrated interdependence in QOL toward the middle and conclusion of treatment. Patients demonstrated more depression than caregivers at all time points. Results suggest that both members of the dyad should be targeted for psychosocial interventions during radiation/chemoradiation treatment period.

AB- Individuals with an asbestos-related diagnosis and their carers face burdens including debilitating and life-limiting physical symptoms and medico-legal stressors. Feelings of social isolation are common. Increasing social connectedness can lead to increased feelings of personal empowerment and may inhibit chronic stress responses. The authors report on the development, via a process of participatory action research, of an online peer-to-peer support group, and the first 30-day test phase of this virtual community. Initial indications are that individuals with an asbestos-related diagnosis and their carers can benefit, in psychosocial terms, from membership of an on-line support group comprised of experientially similar others.

AB- The purpose of this study was to explore intimate relationships after a cancer diagnosis, applying constructivist grounded theory to interviews with 55 Canadian young adult cancer survivors. The core category found was the dynamic interplay between participants’ experiences of cancer and their intimate relationships. The authors found four themes within this core category: the mental experience of cancer, challenged sexual intimacy, the relationship response to strain (supportive or nonsupportive), and adapted intimacy. This research demonstrates the importance of intimate relationships for young adults along their cancer trajectory, revealing that those relationships are severely strained by a cancer diagnosis and treatment yet help to limit negative consequences.

AB- The intercorrelations among the 15 scales of the 30-item Core version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire suggest that one may combine (1) the physical functioning and role functioning scales, (2) the emotional functioning and cognitive functioning scales, and (3) the nine symptom scales. Together with the global health/quality of life scale and the social functioning scale, five measures remain. Principal component analysis of those five measures, using data from Japanese and Dutch breast and lung cancer patients, yielded two dimensions: (1) generalized health related quality of life and (2) health-independent psychological well-being. The correlations of these dimensions with the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and Karnofsky performance substantiated this interpretation.

AB- Although the complexity of age combined with a cancer diagnosis can result in unmet supportive care needs there are seldom resources to assess or address such needs for older people with cancer (OPWC). The purpose of this project was to trial a service to improve the care for OPWC through (1) an expanded supportive care screening process and (2) capacity building of subacute ambulatory care services (SACS) staff to increase referrals to community-based rehabilitation. Methods/design: Collaboration between allied health (AH) staff at an inner city general hospital with a large cancer service, a cancer specialist hospital, and a SACS service in Melbourne, Australia, developed an AH geriatric screening assessment (GSA) tool. Parallel to this process training was provided to SACS staff in relation to working with OPWC. Although close to one half (44%) of SACS staff who participated in this program (n = 22) had over 6 years’ experience, 32% had not worked with OPWC. Prior to training, 81% did not feel confident in their knowledge about working with this cohort. After their training 72% were more confident about normal aging and implications for care of OPWC. Of the 491 patients screened, 80% were older than age 65, however, only 25 resided in the SACS catchment area. More than one third of these did not have clear rehabilitation needs, and the remainder were not referred due to ongoing medical issues. Less than one half of the patients in the catchment area were discussed in a Multi-disciplinary Meeting (MDM) but all were referred to allied health and assessed using the GSA. Although this project did not result in referrals of OPWC to SACS the training program for SACS staff was a success and allied health assessments were improved to include GSA factors. The complexity of care for OPWC was further highlighted through interviews with staff involved with the study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The aims of the study were to assess sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with suicidal ideation in patients with cancer who required a psycho-oncological support. Among 504 participants, there were 136 (23 men and 113 women) cancer patients who completed psychological assessment when admitted to the Psycho-oncology Outpatient Clinic between 2006 and 2011. Suicidal ideation was assessed by Item 9 of the Brief Symptom Inventory, Hopelessness was assessed by the hopelessness subscale of the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale, and Depression was assessed by the depression subscale of the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale. Around 30% of this sample reported affective symptoms and around 20% reported suicidal ideation and hopelessness. Patients who reported suicidal ideation were more hopeless (18.8 ± 6.7 vs. 15.7 ± 5.2; t(134) = 2.54; p &lt; 0.05) and reported more depression (11.8 ± 4.8 vs. 6.8 ± 4.1; t(134) = 5.30; p &lt; 0.001). It is evident that cancer can result in a strong psychological distress in the patient. It is important, therefore, that cancer patients receive a proper assistance and psychological support and that both the possible presence of depression and suicidal ideation are constantly monitored.

AB- Helplines are core feature of the contemporary U.K. health care system, however little is known about callers’ experiences of seeking cancer-related telephone help. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 32 cancer helpline callers. The findings suggest cancer helplines offer callers (1) time to discuss their issues, (2) anonymity, (3) convenience, and (4) an open outlet for anyone affected by cancer including family/friends. Further, the findings highlighted that callers’ help-seeking behavior was multifaceted, with their psychosocial needs being intrinsically intertwined with their information or advice-seeking needs. The implications are discussed in relation to the role of cancer helplines in the healthcare system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Posttraumatic growth has been demonstrated to occur following the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Still unknown is whether patients expect such growth, how growth is perceived at early points in time that follow the cancer experience, and whether patient reports of growth are corroborated by others. Participants were 87 patients and 55 collaterals who reported their anticipation of growth pretreatment and their perceived growth at a 9-month follow-up. Patients' expectations for their own growth were significantly higher than collaterals' expectations for theirs. When anticipated growth was compared to later reported growth, patients overanticipated growth across all domains and collaterals underanticipated growth.

AB- Most studies of the psychosocial needs of patients with head and neck cancers (HNC) use predefined categories and explicitly ask for specified needs. These studies are important but should be complemented with inductive studies based on patients’ own descriptions of experiences. This qualitative study is such a contribution. In repeated interviews positive and negative incidents were collected from 137 patients with HNC, and these experiences were categorized in dimensions expressing needs. A core category—“being included—neglected by a helping system”— emerged from the narrated incidents and was based on the dimensions engagement, competence, and information. The findings are easily related to attachment theory by stressing the significance of establishing trustful relationships with the health care staff, as attachment figures, who respond flexibly and sensitively to the patient's needs. In the constitution of health care as a helping system, all encounters between the patient and health care staff matters. Further research should preferably focus on the creation of guidelines for the constitution of health care as a helping system, that is, how the found factors of a helping system can be operationalized in clinical practice.

AB- The objective of this study was to investigate satisfaction with and feasibility of an online cognitive behavioral-based group intervention (OK Onco Online) for adolescent childhood cancer survivors (CCS). The intervention, carried out by pediatric psychologists, aimed to prevent psychosocial problems. High levels of satisfaction were reported by the psychologists (n &equals; 6) and the CCS (n &equals; 11, age 11&ndash;17). The dropout rate was very low. Some recommendations for optimizing the intervention were mentioned. In conclusion, the positive evaluations by the CCS and the psychologists indicate that the online chat intervention OK Onco Online is a promising innovative group intervention for adolescent CCS. Further research is needed to confirm feasibility and to establish efficacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study assessed the biopsychosocial impact of cancer on veteran older adult survivors by garnering their accounts of their illness experiences. A narrative analysis of 73 cancer diagnosis and treatment stories reveals five "paths" veterans are taking 18 months postdiagnosis. These paths indicate that cancer survivorship cannot be conceptualized as a one-size-fits-all experience but rather is a process of veterans understanding and making sense of the effects of cancer on their lives. Our future goal is to develop a screening tool to help clinicians identify a patient's "path" to tailor survivorship care to meet specific needs.

AB- This study examines the process of dyadic coping among couples who are managing stress related to a partner's breast cancer diagnosis and identifies cultural factors that affect how couples cope together. Utilizing a qualitative method based on relational psychologies, the “Listening Guide,” the authors analyzed the narratives of 28 couples who where coping with early-stage breast cancer and lived in Hong Kong-China, India, and the United States. Analysis revealed four cultural factors influencing the process of coping with breast cancer. These factors included (1) family boundaries, (2) gender roles, (3) personal control, and (4) interdependence. Some couples were able to transcend prevailing cultural norms to re-establish balance in their lives and adapt to the cancer. Implications for using couple-based interventions with cancer patients in differing cultural contexts are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- African Americans are less likely than other groups to receive appropriate surveillance after colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. The objective of this study is to qualitatively explore the role of social support in post-CRC treatment surveillance and ultimately, inform interventions to promote surveillance in African American survivors of CRC. Interviews were conducted with 60 African American survivors of CRC recruited from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) study and the Alabama Statewide Cancer Registry. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were reviewed and coded independently by the authors. The NVivo software package was used to facilitate coding and data management. Survivors were from 4 to 6 years post diagnosis, 57% female, 60% older than age 65 years, 57% from rural Alabama, 30% with stage 1, 32% with stage 2, and 38% with stage 3 disease. Material and emotional social support from family and one's faith community were cited as playing an important role in coping with the disease and posttreatment surveillance. Survivors who reported being adherent with posttreatment surveillance recommendations (according to stage of disease based on self-report of colonoscopy, computed tomography scans, and blood work) reported more religious material and non-material social support, and support from other survivors of CRC. In these African American survivors of CRC, support from family, other survivors of cancer, and the faith community was perceived as being important for adherence to posttreatment surveillance. Interventions to increase posttreatment surveillance in this population may be enhanced by including components that emphasize familial, other cancer survivor, and religious support.

AB- Children with cancer and their families often attend specialized camps (therapeutic recreation) through their cancer treatment journey, yet little is known about the effects of these camps. A qualitative cohort study was used to assess learning and friendship development by campers attending one of four pediatric oncology summer camps during 2010 in North America. Standardized perceived change questionnaires developed by the American Camp Association were administered following camp attendance. Five-hundred and eighteen campers were enrolled: 120 (age 6–9 years) and 398 (age 10 and older). The largest positive response from the younger campers was observed for the question, “At camp did you learn to look forward to trying new activities?” For the older campers’ survey, the items “Becoming better at enjoying being with my friends,” “Becoming better at helping my friends have a good time when they are with me,” and “Becoming better at getting to know more things about my friends” were perceived to increase the most for the majority of campers compared to other questions. Items for which older campers most often perceived little change were “Becoming better at choosing people who would be good friends to be with” and “Becoming better at understanding friends’ emotions.” Camp helps children learn new activities as well as enjoy good times with friends. Dealing with one's own mistakes and understanding others’ emotions are areas for improvement. Ultimately it is hoped that these skills gained at camp will help build coping and resiliency for children/siblings affected by pediatric cancers.

AB- Cancer diagnoses may adversely affect emotional functioning in patients and their caregivers, which in turn may increase risk behaviors, such as tobacco and alcohol use. This study investigates the relationships among problem-solving ability, distress, and risk behaviors in patients with head/neck and lung cancer and their caregivers. The authors hypothesized that patients and caregivers who experienced higher distress would engage in more risk behaviors, but that Social Problem-Solving (SPS) would moderate this effect, in that those who possessed greater SPS ability would engage in fewer risk behaviors. Twenty-one cancer patients and 11 of their caregivers were surveyed shortly after diagnosis. Participants completed the Profile of Mood States, the Social Problem-Solving Inventory—Revised, and measures of tobacco and alcohol use. Total SPS ability was higher in patients than caregivers but generally low in both groups. Total distress was lower in patients compared to caregivers. Mean comparisons indicated that caregivers smoked more cigarettes per day and consumed more alcohol than patients. Results indicate that patients and caregivers may have a decreased ability to solve problems, and that caregivers engage in more frequent risk behaviors than patients, suggesting that caregivers may be at risk and warrant further study. The study design prevents causative conclusions and limited sample size prohibits more complex analyses. Further research on social problem-solving ability, distress, and risk behaviors may reveal more robust relationships and provide insight for intervention development for these groups.

AB- This study investigated relations among optimism, perceived health vulnerability, treatment intensity, and academic, self-regulatory, and social self-efficacy in adolescent survivors of childhood cancer. Fifty-six adolescent survivors (Mage = 16.19 years, SD = 2.48) completed questionnaires. Compared to a previously published sample of adolescents without a history of cancer, survivors reported similar academic, higher self-regulatory, and lower social self-efficacy. Optimism and health vulnerability were associated with changes in academic, self-regulatory, and social self-efficacy. Cancer-specific variables (e.g., treatment intensity, time since treatment ended) were unrelated to self-efficacy. Interventions aimed at enhancing self-efficacy may benefit from exploring optimism and health vulnerabilities as mechanisms for change.

AB- Dispositional cancer worry (DCW) is the uncontrollable tendency to dwell on cancer independent of relevant stimuli (e.g., diagnosis of the disease). Past research has suggested that DCW has two underlying dimensions: severity and frequency. Available measures of DCW severity and frequency were translated and validated in two countries: China and Belgium. Participants (N = 623) completed translated scales, as well as measures of general dispositional worry, cancer fear, and perceived risk. In both locations, DCW measures were reliable (Cronbach's alphas ranged from .78– .93) and demonstrated strong convergent, divergent, and concurrent validity. Severity and frequency factors loaded as expected in exploratory factor analysis. Future research should pursue longitudinal tests of DCW's predictive validity and explore DCW in theoretical models predicting the relationship between worry and cancer prevention and early detection behaviors.

AB- Based on the research method grounded theory and semistructured patient interviews at home following hospitalization, the aim was to provide information on issues relating to the identification and alleviation of patients’ physical and emotional problems, understood as continuity in palliative care. The interviews were based on selected problems that patients found significant. The results are distilled into the core category disheartening interactions and four categories: falling outside the professional framework, not being seen as a person, unidentified/unmet need for guidance and involvement, and patient strategy–minimizing conflict. The categories are significant in generating and maintaining continuity in basic palliative care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Survivors reported more problems on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist compared to normative data but no differences in Sluggish Cognitive Tempo scores. Forty-six percent of the sample reported school difficulties, and 12% of the sample age older than 15 reported smoking. Late-effects clinics should continue to monitor psychological well-being and health behaviors. Further research is recommended to determine whether sluggish cognitive tempo is a useful concept for the assessment of survivors.

AB- There is a need to better understand the posttreatment concerns of the nearly 14 million survivors of cancer alive in the United States today and their receipt of care. Using data from 2,910 posttreatment survivors of cancer from the 2006 or 2010 LIVESTRONG Surveys, the authors examined physical, emotional, and practical concerns, receipt of care, and trends in these outcomes at the population level. Results: 89% of respondents reported at least one physical concern (67% received associated posttreatment care), 90% reported at least one emotional concern (47% received care), and 45% reported at least one practical concern (36% received care). Female survivors, younger survivors, those who received more intensive treatment, and survivors without health insurance often reported a higher burden of posttreatment concerns though were less likely to have received posttreatment care. These results reinforce the importance of posttreatment survivorship and underscore the need for continued progress in meeting the needs of this population. Efforts to increase the availability of survivorship care are extremely important to improve the chances of people affected by cancer living as well as possible in the posttreatment period.

AB- Pain requiring treatment is experienced by many cancer patients at the end of life. Family caregivers are often directly implicated in pain management. This article highlights areas of psychosocial concern for family caregivers managing a family member’s cancer pain at home as they engage in pain management processes. This article is based on the secondary analysis, guided by interpretive description, of data collected for a grounded theory study that explored the processes used by family caregivers to manage cancer patients’ pain in the home. Interviews and field notes from 24 family caregiver interviews were examined to identify areas of family caregiver psychosocial distress. The analysis revealed that family caregivers experienced distress at different phases of the pain management process. Sources of distress for caregivers included feeling as though they were “in a prison” (overwhelmingly responsible), “lambs to slaughter” (unsupported), and “flying blind” (unprepared). In addition, family caregivers expressed distress when witnessing their loved one in pain and when pain crises invoked thoughts of death. In sum, family caregivers managing a loved one’s cancer pain at home are at risk for psychosocial distress. This study identified four key sources of distress that can help health care professionals better understand the experiences of these family caregivers and tailor supportive interventions to meet their needs. Knowledge about sources of distress can help healthcare professionals understand the experiences of these family caregivers and tailor supportive interventions to meet their needs.

AB- This study investigated lung cancer stigma, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL) and validated variable similarities between ever and never smokers. Patients took online self-report surveys. Variable contributions to QOL were investigated using hierarchical multiple regression. Patients were primarily White females with smoking experience. Strong negative relationships emerged between QOL and anxiety, depression and lung cancer stigma. Lung cancer stigma provided significant explanation of the variance in QOL beyond covariates. No difference emerged between smoker groups for study variables. Stigma may play a role in predicting QOL. Interventions promoting social and psychological QOL may enhance stigma resistance skills.

Questionnaires are sent to assess their benefit according to the participants’ point of view. For 58% of participants, support groups helped the return to work, and for 70% it provided personal, family, and relational support. Support groups are a relevant response to expectations and specific issues of patients experiencing return to work after cancer.

Patient, provider, and system-level characteristics all appear to influence AYAs’ perceptions of their medical care. Participants attributed levels of satisfaction with care to the availability and communication of information, the management of side-effects, and the expediency and flexibility of treatments. Struggles with health insurance and finances were evident. Findings contribute to a better understanding of AYAs’ cancer treatment experiences and will inform improvements to oncology care for this population.

Fifteen children (age 6–12) with cancer and their parents (N = 17) completed semistructured interviews and self-report measures to assess coping and coping assistance. Results suggest families utilized a broad array of approach and avoidance strategies to manage cancer and its treatment. Quantitative and qualitative assessments provided complementary and unique contributions to understanding coping among children with cancer and their parents. Using a mixed methods approach to assess coping provides a richer understanding of families’ experiences, which can better inform clinical practice.

AB- This study aims to understand how wives’ mental health and life enjoyment are affected by their perceptions of the sufficiency of the support they render to their husbands who have prostate cancer. Its specific purpose is to determine whether these outcomes accrue more strongly to wives who perceive their husbands coping in avoidant ways. Drawing on data from an interview study of 51 wives of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, the authors employ heiarchical regression analysis to examine the wives’ adjustment in relation to their provision of support to their husbands. Our findings reveal a significant moderating effect of the husbands’ avoidant coping; consistent with cognitive dissonance theory, wives who provided sufficient support to more avoidant husbands demonstrated better mental health and life enjoyment than wives of men who were less avoidant. In addition, the perceived sufficiency of the support provided by the wives’ social networks had a stronger bearing on their adjustment than the support provided by their husbands.

AB- Adjuvant endocrine therapy improves overall survival for women with breast cancer. However, side effects may compromise patients’ quality of life (QOL). This study examined how two communication variables (self-efficacy for symptom communication [SE] and holding back from discussing cancer-related concerns [HB]) relate to QOL, pain and menopausal symptoms. Participants with breast cancer (N = 61) completed questionnaires regarding symptoms, communication, and QOL. SE was positively related to QOL and negatively related to pain interference. HB from discussing cancer-related concerns was related negatively to QOL and positively to pain interference. HB mediated the relationship between SE and QOL as well as between SE and pain interference. Increased SE is beneficial among women on endocrine therapy for breast cancer. Future research should determine if interventions to improve SE are feasible and can improve QOL and symptom tolerability.

Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with young people (N = 15, age: M = 15.9 years) who had a parent diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years. A phenomenological thematic data analysis distinguished three superordinate themes, identifying what helped adolescents cope with their parent's cancer diagnosis. These were parental behavior, specific coping strategies used by the young person, and community support. These results contribute to our knowledge of what can help young people whose parent has been diagnosed with cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In New Zealand, support services have been developed in response to patient need but are variable. The benefits of psycho-social-spiritual care in reducing distress and enhancing quality of life for people with cancer and their families are well established yet unmet needs continue to feature. This project aimed to examine how health care professionals assessed for psycho-social-spiritual distress and unmet need, decisions on appropriate support, and identification of barriers in the referral process. A mixed-methods approach was used for this research. The qualitative phase entailed semistructured interviews with health care professionals working in cancer care. The quantitative phase was an online survey of oncologists and nurses. Thematic analysis was carried out by performing a side-by-side analysis of both sets of data. Nurses were most likely to assess for psycho-social-spiritual need and to refer to support services. Despite a clear mandate to provide regular psycho-social-spiritual assessment, there is no consistency of assessment and referral across New Zealand. There are clearly unmet psycho-social-spiritual needs among people affected by cancer in New Zealand, with health care professionals in this study noting structural impediments to adequate supportive care. There is a mismatch between the importance placed on such care and the capacity that is currently available. The results of this study provide evidence that can be used to argue for improvements in the infrastructure, funding allocation and policy that would allow for better psycho-social-spiritual care within the challenging context of increasing numbers of those affected by cancer.

This study examined individual and contextual factors related to care and noncare dimensions and their relationship to perceptions of the cancer care system. A national sample of 877 cases was modeled using a multilevel modeling approach. Insurance complaints, number of treatments, and advocacy impact were negatively associated with satisfaction with the cancer care system at the individual level. Also, respondents in states where more Christians resided and lower hospital capacity were more likely to indicate satisfaction. Findings suggest implications for practitioners and health policy makers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- As part of a larger meta-analysis seeking moderators of the effectiveness of psycho-oncological interventions, this report focuses on intervention types and characteristics, including protocol components, means of delivery (mode, dose, and therapist variables), and mechanisms of effectiveness. The data set comprised 146 published and unpublished prospective controlled trials with outcomes of anxiety, depression, and distress. Analyses took into account two moderators from analysis of study design features. The authors conclude that each of the four main professional therapy types (education, relaxation, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and expressive-support) has effect and that it is more important to focus on participant variables, notably, elevated baseline distress. Therapy components delivered by nonprofessionals and interventions that affect the patient indirectly show potential. Recommendations for practice and research are made.

AB- This article describes the feasibility of utilizing the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) as a brief psychosocial screener among survivors of pediatric cancer. Participants were parents of a child/adolescent diagnosed with cancer who were off treatment (n = 35) and a subset of adolescents (n = 14). Parent-proxy report using the SDQ was significantly associated with the Child Health Questionnaire. Parents who self-reported long-term uncertainty about their child's illness were more likely to report child psychosocial difficulties. A trend for concordance between patient and parent-proxy report of the SDQ was observed. These preliminary results highlight the potential utility of the SDQ as a screening tool for detection of child/adolescent psychosocial well-being. Further research, with larger samples, is needed to support these results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Young adult (YA) cancer survivors have specific needs because of their age and life stage. The authors investigated the challenges and resource needs of YA survivors, exploring the influence of age at diagnosis (i.e., diagnosis during childhood vs. young adulthood) and the diagnosis of a brain tumor. The authors conducted four focus groups with YA survivors (N = 22, age 18–35), treated for brain tumors or other cancers in childhood (mean age at diagnosis ± SD: brain, 10.7 ± 2.86; other cancers, 10.5 ± 3.51) or as YAs (brain, 23.5 ± 4.04; other cancers, 25.6 ± 4.10). Transcripts of audiotaped sessions were coded using thematic analysis. Common challenges across the groups included physical appearance, fertility, late effects, social relationships, and changing priorities. Childhood cancer survivors struggled with identity formation, social isolation, and health care transitions. Concerns specific to survivors diagnosed as YAs included financial independence and protecting parents. Childhood brain tumor survivors struggled with cognitive deficits, limited career options, and poor social skills, whereas brain tumor survivors diagnosed as YAs emphasized cognitive decline, loss of autonomy, and living with an incurable disease. Despite the unique challenges identified, all groups described similar resource needs including peer support, age-specific information, and having health care providers proactively raise salient issues. Young adult cancer survivors have many similar psychosocial and information needs regardless of age at or type of diagnosis that differ from those of pediatric and older adult survivors. With improved survival rates, the small number of YA in any one institution will grow. It will become increasingly important to create comprehensive, age-appropriate YA programs that address overlapping and unique needs of survivors at this life stage.

AB- New models of cancer care and survivorship ask for empowered patients. But how do we measure that patients can derive strength from themselves (intrapersonal) and their perceived social support (interpersonal)? The 40-item Cancer Empowerment Questionnaire (CEQ) measures psychological empowerment as an individual outcome measure. The CEQ was validated in 140 nonmetastatic female breast cancer survivors (mean 5.5 years postsurgery). Principal component analysis elicited four factors representing intrapersonal (personal strength) and interpersonal (social support, community, health care) aspects of empowerment. The CEQ provides a reliable (Cronbach's α = 0.73–0.94) and valid first attempt to operationalize psychological empowerment in cancer care.

AB- The number of Internet surveys is increasing, and there is a need to examine critically their value in psychosocial cancer care research. This study explored the use of an online method of recruiting and surveying people affected by cancer. An online survey was designed to measure the health status and service needs of adult cancer survivors and caregivers. The online survey received 491 page visits; only 5% of visitors (13 survivors and 14 cancer caregivers) completed the online questionnaire. The average age of survivors and caregivers was 43 and 42 years, respectively. The majority of survivor and caregiver online respondents were female (23/27, 85%) and had been affected by cancer between 1 and 3 years previously (16/27, 59%). Our online research did not appear to be an effective method for recruiting and surveying the psychosocial health of cancer survivors. This study identified potential pitfalls and obstacles of online cancer care surveys particularly in relation to the age of cancer survivors, access to the Internet and the need to ensure surveys are easily and immediately accessible. Future Internet surveys should pay particular attention to the need to advertise and improve survey access via targeted and tailored techniques.

In Australia, such treatments are only available in major metropolitan hospitals. Thus, women diagnosed with this condition in rural and remote areas must relocate to the metropolitan specialist centers for treatment. The focus of this article is on the experience of relocation for specialist care for Indigenous women diagnosed with vulvar cancer from East Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia. The findings presented in this article explore a range of issues that affect the experience of relocation such as community concerns, cultural distress, loneliness, fear, worry, and physical concerns associated with the condition.

AB- Promoting patient-centered care from diagnosis to end of life requires a better understanding of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual coping factors in advanced cancer. Using qualitative methods, the authors explored diagnosis, care planning, and treatment experiences of individuals with metastatic colorectal cancer (N = 26). The main physical factors salient to patients during all care phases included symptoms and physical functioning. Key psychological factors included persistent uncertainty and a range of emotions that varied by care phase. Participants also relied heavily on social and spiritual factors for guidance. Results highlight the complex nature of coping with advanced cancer and the resources needed to facilitate high-quality care.

AB- Patients with neurological diseases often suffer from sleep disturbances. Insomnia among adult brain tumor patients has usually been studied as part of quality-of-life studies, or some case reports on insomnia in these patients have been described. The authors aimed to study insomnia in a prospective study setting among patients with primary brain tumors and evaluate whether insomnia is related to tumor laterality. Entire study population consisted of 70 patients with a solitary primary supratentorial brain tumor treated surgically at the Clinic for Neurosurgery, Oulu University Hospital. The overall functional state of the patients was assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Scale, depression was measured by Beck Depression Inventory, and insomnia by Nottingham Health Profile. Repeated measurements were assessed before tumor operation as well as 3 months and one year after surgery. Prevalence of insomnia among patients with a primary brain tumor waiting for surgery was higher compared to general population, but level of insomnia significantly decreased as soon as 3 months after tumor operation. Patients with a bilateral primary brain tumor had significantly more often insomnia without comorbid depression compared to patients with a left or right tumor for up to one year after operation. The authors suggest that insomnia among patients with a bilateral brain tumor may not be associated with depression but have other biological background.

AB- This analysis examined demographic and medical factors associated with continuous distress in the year following cancer diagnosis. Patients completed the Distress Thermometer, Fatigue and Pain Thermometers, and anxiety and depression measures, at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12 months. A total of 480 patients were grouped into three trajectories for distress, pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine risk factors associated with each symptom pattern. Females were more likely to report continuous distress. Predictors of the remaining outcomes included younger age; a diagnosis of head and neck, gastrointestinal, or prostate cancer; and receipt of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. By identifying risk factors for continuous distress, interventions can be implemented more efficiently and targeted to those who are at an elevated risk.

AB- Unsupportive social interactions (USIs) experienced by people with cancer negatively affect psychological well-being. Forty-five interviews with 26 women were analyzed using directed content analysis to explore USIs experienced during the stressful pretreatment and early postsurgical periods after early-stage breast cancer diagnosis. Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to USIs were also explored. Seventy incidents of USIs were identified within the interviews and grouped into four previously defined and five additional categories. Anxiety, avoiding future interactions, and nondisclosure of thoughts and feelings were typical responses to USIs. These responses hold implications for women’s psychological well-being and need for future interventions and research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Treatment for cancer among adolescents is often more intense and lasts longer than treatment for older or younger patients. It typically causes pain, fatigue, and nausea and affects social and emotional well-being. This study examined the relationships among demographics, physical symptoms, perceived social support from friends and family, and affect (positive and negative) in 102 adolescents (age 13–19) with cancer using correlational analyses. Additionally, perceived social support was explored as a mediator and moderator of the relationship between physical symptoms and affect using regression. Females reported significantly lower friend support and higher negative affect compared to males. Minority participants were more likely to endorse physical symptoms and less negative affect compared to White respondents. Higher report of physical symptoms was significantly related to greater negative affect, whereas higher perceived social support from friends was related to higher positive affect. Adolescents consistently reported high levels of social support from family and friends. Additionally, adolescents tended to report average levels of positive affect and low levels of negative affect compared to healthy populations. No significant mediation or moderation effects were found. This research highlights that females and minorities, and those with greater physical symptoms,may be more vulnerable to poor adjustment to cancer during adolescence. However, overall this study lends support to the notion that adolescents with cancer are an especially resilient population, as these patients endorsed generally high levels of social support and positive affect, with low levels of negative affect.

AB- This qualitative study aimed to identify Veterans’ perceptions of how cancer affects their life following treatment, particularly in relation to treatment side effects and identity as a cancer survivor. A diverse sample of 35 Veteran cancer survivors participated in semistructured, individual interviews. Thematic analysis revealed the enduring impact of diagnosis and chronic uncertainty regarding recurrence, psychological side effects that were periodic and typically self-managed, and physical side effects as common, but considered an acceptable trade-off for increased chances of survival. Perceptions of the term cancer survivor varied considerably among participants. Implications for survivorship wellness and care planning are discussed.

AB- This investigation evaluates two common measures of cancer-related fatigue, one multidimensional/retrospective and one unidimensional/same day. Fifty-two African American survivors of diverse cancers completed fatigue visual analogue scales once daily, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF) once weekly, for four weeks. Zero-order correlations showed retrospective fatigue was significantly related to average, peak, and most recent same-day fatigue. Multilevel random coefficient modeling showed unidimensional fatigue shared the most variance with the MFSI-SF’s General subscale for three weeks, and with the Vigor subscale for one week. Researchers and clinicians may wish to prioritize multidimensional measures when assessing cancer-related fatigue, if appropriate.

AB- Posttraumatic growth (PTG) after cancer can minimize the emotional impact of disease and treatment; however, the facilitators of PTG, including support seeking, are unclear. The authors examined the role of support seeking on PTG among 604 breast cancer survivors ages 40 to 64 from the Health Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle (HEAL) Study. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine predictors of support seeking (participation in support groups and confiding in health care providers) as well as the relationship between support seeking and PTG. Support program participation was moderate (61.1%) compared to the high rates of confiding in health professionals (88.6%), and African Americans were less likely to report participating than non-Hispanic Whites (odds ratio = .14, confidence intervals [0.08, 0.23]). The mean (SD) PTG score was 48.8 (27.4) (range 0–105). Support program participation (β = 10.4) and confiding in health care providers (β = 12.9) were associated (p &lt; .001) with higher PTG. In analyses stratified by race/ethnicity, PTG was significantly higher in non- Hispanic Whites and African American support program participants (p &lt; .01), but not significantly higher in Hispanics/Latinas. Confiding in a health care provider was only associated with PTG for non-Hispanic Whites (p = .02). Support program experiences and patient–provider encounters should be examined to determine which attributes facilitate PTG in diverse populations.

AB- Taylor’s (1983) cognitive adaptation theory posits that when people go through life transitions, such as being diagnosed with a chronic disease, they adjust to their new reality. The adjustment process revolves around three themes: search for positive meaning in the experience or optimism, attempt to regain a sense of mastery in life, as well as an effort to enhance self-esteem. In the sample of 57 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer the Cognitive Adaptation Index successfully predicted participants’ distress (p &lt; .001) accounting for 60% of the variance and lending support for the Taylor’s theory of cognitive adaptation in this population.

AB- Studies have consistently shown cancer diagnosis and treatment to be associated with increased depression. However, research that directly examines the depression and coping strategies of older minority cancer survivors is sparse. Addressing that gap, this study examines depression and coping strategies among older Korean immigrant cancer survivors. A qualitative method approach was utilized by interviewing 15 survivors from the state of New York (NY) and nine from Minnesota (MN). Each interview was digitally audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim in Korean. Grounded theory was employed to analyze the data, using Atlas ti 5.0. Analysis of the MN interviews showed two depression factors: (1) physical deterioration and (2) fear of death. For the NY interviews, analysis highlighted the following factor: loneliness due to disconnectedness from community. Analysis of the MN and the NY interviews for depression coping strategies revealed two primary internal coping strategies: (1) reliance on religion through prayer and (2) psychological strength by avoiding negative thoughts. For external strategies, analysis suggested three shared strategies: (1) social and religious support, (2) medical service utilization, and (3) health management by exercise. Regional differences related to depression factors imply that survivors living in the NY area may need more social support, whereas survivors living in the MN area may need more knowledge around physical changes that follow cancer treatment. Regional similarities across results indicate that availability of social support is a critical factor relieving depression. Thus, specialized intervention programs for reducing depression among cancer survivors should consider regional features.

AB- As long as life could be lived as before patients could cope with their problems. But the progression of the illness challenged feelings and filled life with increasing levels of chaos and feelings of powerlessness. Relatives became involved quite late in the patients’ interaction with the professionals, an interaction that was characterized by lack of continuity and the professionals’ focus on the patient’s sick body. It was therefore seldom that professionals had insight into the family’s resources and need for professional support. This made it more difficult for the family to evaluate, control and cope with their suffering. Instead, patients gradually adapted to the professionals’ and relatives’ priorities and sometimes their control over the increasingly failing and dying body.

AB- It is important to understand the psychosocial needs of rural survivors of cancer to better serve this group. Survivors and partners filled out a pre-tested survey addressing general and mental health, quality of life and demographics. Twenty-nine survivors and 15 partners responded. Over 50% of both groups were at-risk for depression; 34% of the cancer survivors had some type of psychosocial problem requiring assistance. Areas to be targeted for psychosocial interventions for rural survivors include: management of side effects/complications of treatment; adjustment to changes in quality of life; emotional support; cancer impact on social relationships; uncertainty reduction.

AB- More than 60 million Americans are informal caregivers to adults, which can negatively affect their health. Data from 126 White and 62 African American female caregivers in North Carolina were analyzed to describe social support and coping among family caregivers of patients with prostate cancer and to assess for racial differences. Social support amount and some coping methods differed by race. There was no racial difference in social support satisfaction. Borderline significant difference in social support by health status was found and this differed by race. These racial differences should be explored further to better understand the availability of caregiving resources and their health effects.

AB- This cross-sectional study investigated the psychosocial adjustment of 70 partners of patients with breast cancer by comparing their emotional adjustment and quality of life (QoL) with 70 partners of women without cancer. The role of marital intimacy in their adjustment and the moderating effect of group type were analyzed. The partners of patients with breast cancer presented higher levels of anxious and depressive symptomatology; poor social, psychological, general and physical QoL; and higher levels of intimacy. The moderation analysis showed that higher levels of intimacy predicted lower levels of depression and anxiety and greater QoL only among the partners of cancer patients.

AB- In this study, the question of whether using slightly illusionary, positive attributions of self, control, and meaning (e.g., cognitive adaptation theory), in the face of disconfirmatory evidence, facilitates quality of life in late-stage cancer patients was examined. Eighty late-stage cancer patients (Mean age = 59.7, SD = 12.5; 48.8% male, 51.2% female; varying cancer diagnoses) who recently failed or refused first line anti-neoplastic treatment completed questionnaires assessing meaning, control, self-esteem, and optimism, as well as physical and psychological quality of life. Findings suggest that greater self-esteem, control, and meaning predicted physical and psychological quality of life, with physical quality of life being influenced by control beliefs and psychological quality of life influenced by self-esteem. Optimism independently predicted physical quality of life and neither mediated nor moderated the relationship between cognitive adaptation and quality of life. Findings suggest that slightly positive, illusionary beliefs of self, control, and meaning predicted quality of life even in the presence of clear, disconfirmatory environmental evidence.

AB- This study examined relationships among demographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables in adult children of cancer patients. Two hundred and fourteen participants completed measures of posttraumatic growth (PTG), distress, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, social support, and family functioning. Significant gender differences in all PTG dimensions were found, as well as associations among PTG, gender, parental dependency, distress, PTSD, and family functioning. Social support was not a mediator in the relationship between gender and PTG. Gender, education, disease duration, dependency, distress, and family flexibility predicted PTG. Finally, PTG had a moderating effect in the relationship between distress and PTSD/social support. These results may guide psychosocial interventions in this population.

AB- One-hundred and forty-five people attended six online cancer survivor workshops. Each workshop was monitored by two facilitators, who generated a total of 1,537 online posts. The authors developed a scheme for coding facilitator posts, combining grounded codes with categories developed by Spiegel and Classen for coding therapist responses in cancer support groups. Participants received a mean of 10.6 facilitator posts. Improvement in two health outcomes (practice of mental relaxation and illness intrusiveness) were significantly correlated with supportive posts and total number of posts. The coding scheme was easily applied and appears reliable. The data suggests that more facilitation is better. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study examined associations between avoidance and approach coping and patient delay in cancer patients (N = 1024). Approach coping was associated with short appraisal intervals (time from symptom discovery to recognition of symptom seriousness). Avoidance coping was associated with long appraisal intervals when adjusting for covariates. Help-seeking intervals (time from recognition of symptom seriousness to contact to general practitioner) were only associated with approach coping and only when adjusting for the influence of covariates. The results revealed a complex relationship between coping and patient delay and supported that normal processing of health threats implies avoidance and approach coping strategies.

Translation of the QLQ-OG25 was done according to EORTC guidelines. Each of the 98 patients filled out the two EORTC questionnaires and a personal questionnaire. Reliability and validity test were performed and patients’ comments were analyzed. The Polish version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-OG25 are reliable and valid tools for measuring health-related quality of life in patients with esophagi-gastric cancer.

AB- Past research suggests that psychosocial responses to advanced or recurrent cancer vary by age. This study compares the relative influences of patients’ age and recurrence status on indicators of symptom distress, anxiety, and depression following a diagnosis of advanced cancer. A prospective study of advanced cancer support provided patient outcome data reported at baseline, 3-, and 6-month intervals. Cohorts were defined by age group and recurrence status and latent growth curves fit to anxiety, depression, and symptom distress outcomes. Middle-age recurrent patients reported the highest symptom distress, depression, and anxiety across time points. Older recurrent patients fared worse at baseline than older nonrecurrent patients, but outcome scores converged across time points. Recurrent cancer presents a distinct challenge that, for middle-age patients, persists across time. It may be beneficial to develop targeted educational and support resources for middle-age patients with recurrent disease.

AB- Among psychosocial factors affecting emotional adjustment and quality of life, social support is one of the most important and widely studied in cancer patients, but little is known about the perception of support in specific significant relationships in patients with cancer. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Quality of Relationship Inventory (QRI) by evaluating its factor structure and its convergent and discriminant validity in a sample of cancer patients. A total of 388 patients completed the QRI. Convergent validity was evaluated by testing the correlations between the QRI subscales and measures of general social support, anxiety and depression symptoms. Discriminant validity was examined by testing group comparison. The QRI’s longitudinal invariance across time was also tested. Principal axis factor analysis with promax rotation identified three factors accounting for 42.99% of variance: perceived social support, depth, and interpersonal conflict. Estimates of reliability with McDonald’s ω coefficient were satisfactory for all the QRI subscales (ω ranging from 0.75–0.85). Satisfaction from general social support was negatively correlated with the interpersonal conflict subscale and positively with the depth subscale. The interpersonal conflict and social support scales were correlated with depression and anxiety scores. We also found a relative stability of QRI subscales (measured 3 months after the first evaluation) and differences between partner status and gender groups. The Quality of Relationship Inventory is a valid tool for assessing the quality of social support in a particular relationship with cancer patients.

AB- This study used the transactional model of stress and coping to examine the relationship between cancer survivors’ self-reported efforts to manage stress and the adoption of health behaviors across various lifestyle behavior domains. The authors analyzed data of 2,888 cancer survivors from a national, population-based, cross-sectional survey. Cancer survivors who indicated making active efforts to control stress were more likely to make changes in their physical, psychosocial, and preventive health behaviors as compared to cancer survivors who used passive stress-coping approaches. Future interventions aimed at promoting health behaviors among cancer survivors may benefit from incorporating a stress-coping component.

AB- In the United States, Black men are at higher risk than White men for lung cancer mortality whereas rates are comparable between Black and White women. This article draws from empirical work in lung cancer, mental health, and health disparities to highlight that race and depression may overlap in predicting lower treatment access and utilization and poorer quality of life among patients. Racial barriers to depression identification and treatment in the general population may compound these risks. Prospective data are needed to examine whether depression plays a role in racial disparities in lung cancer outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Cultural beliefs often influence people in seeking appropriate health care. In South Africa, misperceptions and fear about medical interventions contribute to the fact that many indigenous people prefer to make use of traditional healers. This qualitative study explores Xhosa patients’ perception of cancer and cancer treatment modalities, and their need for support. Language creates an image of the unknown to which people attach meaning. Oncology social workers play an important role in educating people about cancer and the treatment thereof, as doctors seldom have time to deal with the psychosocial aspects of cancer. Health care providers need to be sensitive to patients’ perceptions to render the best possible cancer care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Knowledge on cross-cultural quality of life (QOL) and illness perceptions may help women with breast cancer cope more effectively. The self regulation model (SRM) guided the current exploratory longitudinal pilot-study. Central to SRM is the perception of health threats and their effects on QOL. Illness perceptions and QOL were assessed in 22 Dutch and 21 Japanese patients with breast cancer who filled out questionnaires before, 1 week, and 8 weeks after the first chemotherapy course. The questionnaires assessed QOL and illness perceptions. Patients’ scores were compared with groups of patients with other chronic somatic illnesses (asthma, diabetes). Patients in both samples reported major impact of chemotherapy on global health status, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, constipation and diarrhea. Differences between Japanese and Dutch patients were limited to social functioning and financial problems. Japanese patients expressed stronger concerns about their illness than Dutch patients. Results of the Japanese and Dutch patients with breast cancer differed from data in patients with asthma on consequences, timeline, concern and emotional response. Results of Japanese patients differed from patients with type 2 diabetes on timeline and concern, whereas Dutch patients differed on timeline and consequences. Japanese and Dutch breast cancer patients have—overall—similar illness perceptions and QOL responses and are aware of the typical characteristics of their disease. The results support the feasibility of cross-cultural psychosocial research in oncology and offer implications for clinical interventions which impact on self-efficacy to empower patients with breast cancer.

AB- Due to the aging of the Baby Boomer generation, surviving with breast cancer will become more common, but also more complicated, as older women are often dealing with additional chronic illnesses and problems of aging. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how older women view surviving breast cancer in context with aging. Findings suggest that most women are able to put their cancer experience in the background and come to view breast cancer as a bump in the road through expecting illness with aging, putting cancer in perspective, and sensing a partnership.

Specially, the predictive and incremental validity of EI for predicting health-related quality of life beyond the level attributable to personality was examined. Emotional intelligence showed unique and significant variance in prediction of different health-related quality of life dimensions. These findings provide preliminary evidences that EI abilities are useful additions in the field of psycho-oncology. The potential value of including EI programs to complement current psychoeducational approaches aimed at preserving or improving cancer patient health-related quality of life is discussed.

The work on patient access, barriers to participation, and service evaluation are providing some insights that can help guide practitioners in their efforts to ensure that services designed to meet psychosocial need reach and involve the appropriate individuals. However, this direction is presently in its infancy leaving many questions unanswered. This article makes a contribution to advancing and strengthening this line of research through a fresh perspective on the topic provided by consumer research with individuals diagnosed with a hematological malignancy. The research was initiated and funded by the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland (LFQ) with the aim of exploring the experience of survivorship for individuals diagnosed with a hematological malignancy to inform supportive care service provision and development. The findings from the research posit the notion of “receptivity” as an important new concept that can contribute to the deepening of our understanding of the myriad of factors associated with effectively engaging with individuals in supportive care service provision.

AB- Being a parent of a child diagnosed with cancer poses an enormous stressor. Indeed, several parents have difficulties adjusting to such a situation and react with symptoms of traumatic stress, depression, and reduced quality of life. However, there is little conceptual work on behavioral mechanisms that contribute to suboptimal adaptation in these parents. The authors present a conceptualization in which experiential avoidance and rumination are suggested to contribute to increased levels of traumatic stress and suboptimal adaption. Based on this conceptualization, a recently developed intervention for parents of children with cancer, in the form of guided self-help, is presented. Finally, the authors present a successful case study as an example of the application of this intervention. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB- Little is known about the sexual well-being of male Veteran cancer survivors, or the relationship of sexual concerns to psychosocial adaptation postcancer. This study examined the association between sexual self-esteem and psychosocial concerns in male Veteran cancer survivors. Forty-one male survivors were recruited from a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital to participate in a pilot study addressing cancer survivorship care for Veterans. Sixty- to 90-minute interviews were conducted, assessing sociodemographic, medical, stress/burden (cancer-related posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD], depression), and resource (social support, post-traumatic growth) variables. Twenty-one (51.2%) Veteran cancer survivors reported lowered sexual self-esteem as a result of cancer, which corresponded to significantly higher levels of depression and cancer-related PTSD. The lowered sexual self-esteem group also indicated significantly lower social support. Veteran cancer survivors with lowered sexual self-esteem tend to have higher levels of stress and lower levels of resources, putting them at risk for lowered quality of life. This increased risk highlights the importance of addressing sexual well-being in the survivorship care of Veterans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Colorectal cancer is considered to be preventable because of its developmental progression. Effectively communicating about the various screening procedures for the disease is an important weapon in combating its incidence and mortality. Successful health communication must take into account the health literacy of and cultural relevance to the targeted audience. More than 40% of adults in the United States have low literacy skills. Unfortunately, many health communication materials are not culturally relevant and are written at a level of literacy that is too high. Thus, research is needed to determine how inadequate health literacy influences health behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This review examines issues related to population-based colorectal cancer screening and strategies to increase screening levels for all clients, particularly the elderly. Because cancer survival is inversely related to the stage of cancer at the time of detection and the costs of screening are less than the costs of treatment, screening levels are used increasingly as a measure of high-quality health care. Patients in acute and primary care settings underestimate their risk and overestimate their screening; providers also overestimate the level of screening in their patients. Strategies to increase patients' completion of screening include speaking directly with patients in the office, making follow-up telephone calls, and using behavioral health education strategies. Provider issues that may act as barriers to the completion of screenings also are discussed. Special concerns related to diverse populations (including immigrants) include issues regarding language and dialect, the appropriate use of interpreters, and the reading level of educational materials.

AB- African Americans bear a disproportionate burden of mortality from colorectal cancer. Because the majority of excess deaths are linked to delayed detection (after the cancer has spread), interventions to promote acceptance of and compliance with screening are urgently needed. This article considers strategies to overcome barriers to screening for colorectal cancer among African Americans. The authors draw attention to the barriers that may be more influential among African Americans than in other groups: for example, fear of cancer, fatalism, reliance on self-care, limited opportunities to screen, and inadequate provider-patient communication. Previous efforts to promote screening for breast cancer and other health behaviors suggest that community-based approaches designed to effect mutually reinforcing changes at the individual, community, and health care system levels may be best suited to raise awareness of colorectal cancer, promote acceptance of screening, and facilitate compliance in African American communities.

AB- This study examined knowledge and practices regarding screening for colorectal cancer among 312 male and 332 female Chinese-Americans in Chicago's Chinatown. A Chinese translation and cultural adaptation of the Cancer Control Supplement Questionnaire from the National Health Interview Survey was used to interview the respondents, who ranged in age from 40 to 69 years. Approximately 95% of the respondents had never been screened with the fecal occult blood test (FOBT), compared with 70% of the general population--far below the 50% target set by the Healthy People 2000 program. The majority of respondents had never heard of the digital rectal examination (DRE), and approximately 20% of respondents had never had one. Fewer than half the respondents knew about the FOBT and thus had never had one, and only a third were able to identify at least one warning sign of cancer. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified educational level and knowledge of the warning signs as the significant factors influencing knowledge about DRE and FOBT. Education alone was associated with use of DRE, and age alone was associated with use of FOBT. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Cancer fatalism has been identified as a barrier to colorectal cancer screening among the rural elderly, yet cancer fatalism may not be an all-or-none phenomenon, which suggests higher levels of cancer fatalism may have a more significant influence on screening behaviors. Therefore, this descriptive study attempted to differentiate higher and lower levels of cancer fatalism and to identify predictors of high levels of fatalism among 204 elderly African American women who attended senior citizen centers in a southern state. Data were collected using the Powe Fatalism Inventory, the Knowledge of Colorectal Cancer Questionnaire, and the Demographic Data Questionnaire. The scores among women with high levels of fatalism were twice as high as the other women's scores. These women also were older, had less education, had less knowledge about colorectal cancer, and were more likely to have lower annual incomes. Age, education, and knowledge about the disease predicted high levels of fatalism. More research is needed to identify additional predictors of high levels of fatalism and to establish trends in screening behaviors when fatalistic perceptions are present. To negate the influence of these perceptions, educational strategies should target both providers and patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Telephone interviews with 67 ethnically diverse first-degree relatives of colorectal cancer cases indicated that only 19% believed they were at elevated risk. Nonwhites were much more likely to underestimate their risk compared with Whites. The most common barrier to screening was fear of finding cancer. Pain associated with sigmoidoscopy was cited much more often by nonwhites (82%) compared with Whites (45%), as were feeling 'violated,' not knowing where to obtain screening, and difficulties in obtaining an appointment for screening. Focus group data on 56 mixed-risk participants revealed that among Hispanic men, the shame of being seen as sick or weak was a major disincentive to be screened. African American men cited a general mistrust of physicians and a lack of physicians' sensitivity as barriers. Chinese participants expressed a preference for exhausting all Eastern forms of treatment before seeking care from Western physicians. These findings can help to guide development of interventions to increase participation in routine screening. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Although the health belief model constructs of perceived benefits and barriers have been related to other cancer screening behaviors, benefits and barriers to fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) have not been measured consistently, and little is known about these variables in relation to flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. The purpose of this study was to establish the psychometric properties of six scales, in a sample of adult patients with colorectal cancer and adenomotous polyps, measuring benefits and barriers related to screening for colorectal cancer, including FOBT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Reliability coefficients for the scales ranged from .65 to .77. Construct validity was established using exploratory factor analyses with results confirming unidimensionality of constructs. Construct validity was further assessed by testing theoretical relationships among benefits, barriers, and screening behaviors. Results of analyses of variance were consistent with theoretical predictions: Perceived benefits were higher and perceived barriers were lower for people who had undergone sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy compared with people who had not had these tests.

AB- Significant gains have been made in the detection and treatment of cancer, contributing to increased survival, but a cancer diagnosis and treatment may be accompanied by physical and psychosocial after-effects. Distress screening has been championed as a mechanism to identify patients with high levels of psychosocial morbidity for subsequent assessment and psychosocial care delivery. However, implementation of distress screening has been variable, in scope and in the consistency and quality of metrics and methods used. This capstone article identifies challenges in the measurement and implementation of distress screening and examines future opportunities for research and implementation.

Screening for distress and provision of psychosocial care in oncology treatment settings has been identified as a future accreditation standard by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC). Because there are few available models of programs of distress screening and referral to inform oncology social workers and other members of the psychosocial support team with planning their own programs, this article seeks to provide exemplars of best practices that are currently in place in four different settings where psychosocial support is provided to people living with cancer and their families. Each program will provide an overview of how it was successfully established and its contribution toward evolving evidence-informed best practices.

AB- Despite the widespread use of distress screening instruments in cancer care, the reliability and validity of these instruments for a diverse population of cancer patients have not been well established. This is a systematic review of the conceptual and statistical equivalence of screening instruments of 148 psycho-oncology studies that included distress screening instruments. The findings indicate that screening measures of distress have comparable reliability, sensitivity, and specificity for White, Latino, and Asian samples. However, it is unclear if equivalent psychometrics are found among minority ethnic groups (e.g., African American) and immigrants within countries. Given the ethnic diversity among cancer patients and the lack of representation of this diversity in the current research, it is critical that researchers begin to include cancer patients of minority ethnic/racial groups in their samples so that health care providers can screen for distress with cultural sensitivity.

AB- Quality cancer care requires identifying and addressing the psychosocial needs of cancer patients. Oncology social workers have long been on the forefront of this endeavor. Although there has been longstanding interest in screening cancer patients for distress, it has recently been included as a quality of care metric in institutions accredited by the American College of Surgeons. Implementing routine screening for distress in oncology settings requires thoughtful planning, including assessing various screening instruments and considering a host of variables within each practice setting. Oncology social workers are best positioned to provide leadership in operationalizing this mandate and to lead their team in the choice of a distress measure for compliance with the screening guideline. This article highlights the most popular distress screening measures used in oncology and their psychometric properties.

AB- The purpose of this pilot study was to explore oncology social workers experiences with the introduction and use of distress screening tools with patients who are diagnosed with cancer. Focus groups were conducted with 15 oncology social workers, who were primarily employed in large hospitals or cancer centers. The results fell into three broad areas: initiating distress screening, adapting distress screening to the setting, and evaluating distress screening. Findings revealed that social workers face many decisions as they adapt distress screening to their settings, including when and how to measure distress, and how to refer patients to services. Social workers were concerned about being overwhelmed with referrals and sought to manage the screening to better identify those who are likely to benefit from services. This research suggests a need for further study, the development of practice guidelines, and training of oncology social workers.

AB- This is a qualitative study of listserv postings by members of the Social Work Oncology Network (SWON) in response to the Commission on Cancer’s 2011 guidelines for distress screening of cancer patients. Archived listserv postings for the period of December 2010 to November 2011 were deidentified and a sample was derived by a list of keywords for the analysis. Aims of the study included describing the general categories and themes of the postings devoted to the new distress screening standard and examining the process of facilitation of mutual support and information exchange by oncology social workers in response to the new screening standards. During the 12-month timeframe there were 242 unique listserv postings sampled for the analysis. Oncology social worker (OSW) discussion of the distress screening guidelines remained a constant topic over the 12 months, and major themes that emerged from the data included processes of implementation of distress screening in cancer centers, screening policies and protocols, screening tool choice, and oncology social worker professional identity. The SWON listserv members used the listserv as a mechanism to post their requests for information on screening, to share their experiences in the beginning stages of implementing the guidelines, and to build support for legitimizing oncology social workers as the lead profession in the implementation of the guidelines in member cancer centers.

AB- Throughout its history, social work has played a critical role in major client/patient care initiatives because of its unique perspective, wisdom, and skills. The new screening standards set forth by the American College of Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer place oncology social workers at the forefront of developing and implementing procedures for distress screening. Our profession is again challenged to work across disciplines and change systems of care to improve the health and welfare of patients with cancer and their families. Indeed, emerging research suggests that the use of psychosocial screening instruments results in reductions in emotional distress, better quality of life, and improved patient–provider communication. As an introduction to this special issue on distress screening, this article offers a brief overview of issues related to distress screening that are covered by papers authored in this special issue by Association of Oncology Social Work members. Topics addressed include a review of the historical context driving distress screening implementation, barriers and challenges to oncology social workers trying to implement distress screening, statistical and cultural considerations for selecting screening tools, best practice models, and future considerations. This special issue is intended to be a primer and serves to promote oncology social workers’ involvement and leadership in the development and implementation of distress screening.

AB- Pain/distress during pediatric cancer treatments has substantial psychosocial consequences for children and families. The authors examined relationships between children’s positive dispositional attributes, parents’ empathic responses, and children’s pain/distress responses to treatment procedures. Participants were 41 pediatric cancer patients and parents. Several weeks before treatment, parents rated children’s resilience and positive dimensions of temperament. Parents’ pretreatment empathic affective responses to their children were assessed. Children’s pain/distress during treatments was rated by multiple independent raters. Children’s resilience was significantly and positively associated with parents’ empathic affective responses and negatively associated with children’s pain/distress. Children’s adaptability and attention focusing also showed positive relationships (p &lt; 0.10) with parents’ empathic responses. Parents’ empathic responses mediated effects of children’s resilience on children’s pain/distress. Children’s positive dispositional attributes influence their pain/distress during cancer treatments; however, these effects may be mediated by parents’ empathic responses. These relationships provide critical understanding of the influence of parent–child relationships on coping with treatment.

AB- Perceived social support has shown to be key to adjustment along the cancer trajectory, but results remain contradictory about the disclosure of the experience of the illness (social sharing) and may reflect the importance of patients characteristics. The authors explored the associations between social sharing, perceived social support, and emotional adjustment in nonmetastatic breast cancer patients and how alexithymia may impact these associations. One hundred and thirteen women with breast cancer from a cancer care center in Villejuif (France) were assessed after breast surgery. Participants completed measures of depression, negative affect, and alexithymia together with a self-description of social sharing of their disease experience and perceived social support. Higher depression and negative affect were related to a high level of emotional sharing, a low satisfaction with confidant’s reactions, and a high perceived negative support. In comparison with low-alexithymia patients, those with high alexithymia showed positive associations between negative emotional outcomes and (1) negative social support and (2) emotional sharing. These results suggest that the relationships between social sharing/support and emotional outcomes depend also on individual characteristics, such as alexithymia. Assessing perceived social support and alexithymia in cancer patients is useful to identify who might benefit from social sharing. Interventions could focus on helping the social network and environment to adjust to the socioemotional characteristics of breast cancer patients along the cancer trajectory.

AB- Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment, known as “chemobrain,” has been described as a side effect of chemotherapy and is associated with cognitive changes on quality of life especially among older cancer survivors. This longitudinal feasibility study examined the relationship between physical fitness, cognitive health, and quality of life among two groups of older adults: those on chemotherapy, and those who have completed chemotherapy. To assess cognitive health, we used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and demographic information from the Healthy Brain Questionnaire. For quality of life, we used the McGill Quality of Life assessment. Physical activity was assessed using Metabolic Equivalency Tasks from the Compendium of Physical Activities classification system. t-Tests and regression analyses indicated that at Time 1 those on chemotherapy had lower cognitive health scores than those off chemotherapy. Yet at Time 2, as physical activities increased, cognitive health and quality of life improved for those on chemotherapy. However, those who had completed chemotherapy also benefited from an increase in physical activities over time. The results have implications for health care practitioners in oncology settings to better inform patients of cognitive challenges resulting from chemotherapy and the importance of participation in physical activities. Future research should compare different age groups among a larger sample. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The purpose of this article is to report on the development of an educational intervention that focuses on providing women with gynecological cancer information on sexuality. Intervention development was guided by the Medical Research Council framework for complex intervention development. A phased approach was taken to the design and evaluation of this complex intervention which included (1) an in-depth literature review, (2) selection of a theoretical framework, (3) a qualitative study, (4) development of intervention content and process, and (5) pilot testing of the intervention. The educational intervention consists of an information booklet combined with a verbal education session. Content of the intervention is guided by a conceptual framework of sexuality, whereas the intervention process is guided by andragogical principles and the PLISSIT model. Content validity was established by patient and expert review. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The objective of this exploratory study was to evaluate the impact of advanced parental cancer on adolescents’ psychological status. A sample of 28 adolescents, having a parent with advanced cancer, was recruited and compared with a sample from the general population (N = 2,346). Late adolescents (age 15 to 18) experienced significantly more psychological distress than early adolescents (age 12 to 14). Moreover, late adolescents experienced significantly higher psychological distress than the general population for the same age group, which was not the case for early adolescents. Implications for adolescents living in families touched by advanced cancer are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study examined whether late effects and poor survivor quality of life (QOL) characterize discordant parent dyads and “unhealthy” family functioning in neuroblastoma survivors. Parents of 135 neuroblastoma survivors (78 two-parent dyads) completed measures of late effects and family functioning, and survivors completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL). Although average family functioning scores were “healthy,” parent concordance was lower for family functioning than late effects reports. Parent concordance did not differ by late effects or QOL. Family functioning scores were poorer when survivors had more late effects and low physical QOL scores. Parent data should be considered separately when examining child cancer outcomes.

Forty-two women who underwent surgery for the removal of either a cancerous or benign breast mass indicated their worries about dying and completed measures of death-thought accessibility and QOL. Women with cancer reported lowered physical, emotional, and functional well-being. Further, although they did not differ in explicit worry about death, women with cancer (compared to those with a benign mass) evidenced greater death-thought accessibility, which in turn mediated the effect of cancer diagnosis on well-being.

AB- This article reports on a qualitative, longitudinal follow-up of a cohort of breast cancer survivors through which their pretreatment psychological adjustment thought processes and behaviors were compared with those 2 years following diagnosis. Analysis revealed five interrelated themes reflecting changing thought processes and behaviors over time. Quantitative measures of psychological adjustment at 2 years were consistent with the qualitative findings in some respects; however, the concepts measured by these tools were inconsistent with themes identified through qualitative analysis. Findings support a need to study ways to assess women’s psychosocial needs and intervene to support adjustment among 2-year breast cancer survivors.

AB- This study was designed to identify potential determinants of parenting stress in parents with leukemia or lymphoma and with children younger than age 18 years. Participants recruited at a comprehensive cancer center completed self-report measures of parenting stress, attachment style, parenting alliance, depression, and anxiety. Depression was positively correlated with parenting stress. Anxious and avoidant attachment styles, but not the degree of physical distress or the quality of the parenting alliance, significantly predicted parenting stress. These findings underscore the relationship of parenting stress to psychological well-being and the contribution of individual characteristics in parents to this stress.

AB- The purpose of this multicenter longitudinal randomized controlled trial was to examine the efficacy of self-administered stress management training (SSMT) in improving quality of life and reducing psychological distress among patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. Participants were randomized to SSMT (n = 111) or usual psychosocial care only (n = 109). Mixed linear modeling demonstrated no significant improvements in primary outcome measures; however, participants assigned to SSMT reported using significantly more relaxation techniques (p &lt; 0.0001), showed improvements on emotional adjustment scores, and demonstrated a stabilizing effect on the functional adjustment scores. Findings highlight the usefulness of SSMT in community clinical settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- There are inconsistent findings regarding whether a mother’s diagnosis of cancer affects her child’s psychological health. The aim of this study was to compare maternally perceived symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children of women with and without breast cancer. Forty mothers with breast cancer (assessed within 8 weeks of diagnosis) and 39 mothers without breast cancer were administered the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/6-18), UCLA Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Index, and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive discriminant analysis revealed that mothers with cancer perceived their children to have significantly greater symptoms of PTSD and internalizing distress than the mothers without cancer. No significant difference was found in maternal perception of externalizing symptoms in their children. Results revealed the importance of the assessment of PTSD in children whose mothers have cancer and the discussion includes implications for future research and clinical interventions.

AB- The authors explored 12 couples’ coping with their children’s diagnosis and treatment of retinoblastoma using a semistructured interview, with qualitative, descriptive, narrative-interpretative analysis. Findings showed that the parents’ experienced increased distress with the physician’s first suspicion that something was seriously wrong. Distress was ameliorated when they arrived at a specialty treatment center but increased as they tackled treatment decisions. Distress decreased again after they consented to enucleation but increased after hospital discharge. The parents’ strength, their ability together and individually, to separate and split between cognition and emotion contributed to coping. Parents need support from a multidisciplinary staff and parents who coped with retinoblastoma. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study examines which psychosocial characteristics are associated with breast cancer survivors’ partners’ posttreatment needs for information and support. Eighty-four partners completed measures of coping, social support, illness representations, perceived stress, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, and marital malfunctioning. Partners in need reported higher anxiety and depression, emotional illness representations, and emotion-oriented coping than partners without needs. Moreover, partners needing information and support took a more negative view on the timeline and consequences of their spouse’s posttreatment condition. Interventions aimed at enhancing partners’ posttreatment adjustment should focus on partners responding emotionally as well as perceiving their spouse’s condition as a chronic condition.

KP- measurement & influence of coping in management of psychological impact of cancer
SU- Coping Behavior; Measurement; Neoplasms; Stress
AB- Discusses the measurement and influence of coping variables on management of cancer demands, using a transactional model of coping (R. S. Lazarus, S. Folkman, 1984). Since both coping and cancer are multifaceted in nature the selection of the measurement must take this aspect into account. Four sets of coping variables—stimulus, appraisal (primary and secondary), response, and outcome (efficacy and effectiveness) have been researched to define the term coping. It has been defined as a response variable to manage specific demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person. Similarly cancer includes a broad and diverse range of demands. Two methods are used in assessments of coping with cancer, 1 focusing on global approach and the other asking patients how they have coped with one demand they appraised as stressful. Recent research on coping responses and the demands of cancer has been presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Health; Illness Behavior; Methodology; Neoplasms; Psychosocial Factors
AB- Proposes a research strategy that combines both qualitative and quantitative methods in the research of psychosocial variables in health and illness issues. An overview of methodological concerns and research strategies of the 2 methods is presented. Qualitative techniques, such as unstructured ethnographic interviews and participant observations may be used initially, to discover important variables and develop hypotheses. These may then be measured and statistically tested through the use of quantitative research techniques. Review of 2 studies using this strategy, demonstrates its utility in understanding interactions of various psychosocial factors in the cancer experience. Applications of the strategy to non-cancer-related illness are also discussed. Practical issues of sampling, analysis, and cost in relation to the combined strategy are addressed.

SU- Coping Behavior; Emotional Adjustment; Internal External Locus of Control; Neoplasms
AB- Discusses theoretical and methodological issues of perceived control (PC) in coping with the experience of cancer. Social learning, learned helplessness, cognitive social learning, and social psychological theories illustrate the central role that perceptions of control play in the maintenance of emotional well-being and dealing with stressful life situations like cancer. Current theoretical issues focus on investigating those situations where PC is adaptive and on the origins of PC. Various instruments to measure psychological control may be used to obtain indices of global and specific measures of locus of control and perceived control. Important dimensions of PC like global vs specific control, primary vs secondary control processes, and central vs consequence related control are also discussed. Review of these theories and processes have led to the formulation of a model for clinical applications of PC. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

A taxonomy illustrating the relation of religious coping, self-management, and adjustment, provides a framework for conducting further research. A review of the existing instruments in the area reveal that they assess religious coping, levels of psychosocial competence, physical health and psychological adjustment. Development of new measures using qualitative strategies, such as, case studies and focus groups, and quantitatively measured constructs may aid in assessment of religious or spiritual functioning in clinical contexts. Mental health professionals need to be sensitized to the role of religion and spirituality as coping mechanisms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Adjustment; Methodology; Neoplasms; Psychosocial Factors; Stress
AB- Discusses conceptual and methodological issues in research of resource variables in psychosocial oncology. Resources may facilitate attainment of some positive end state or avoidance of some negative end state. Vulnerability and resistance are the 2 dominant perspectives on the role of psychosocial resources in stress and adaptation research. Personal and social resources can affect adaptational outcomes through several routes. Personal resources include perceived control, coping and religion and spirituality, while social resources include social support and family functioning. The role of resource factors in adaptation to cancer concerns the cumulative effects of stress on people's resource reserves. The 1st part of the volume contains articles that focus on core resource variables, 3 on personal and 2 on social resources. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Discusses the relation of social support to psychosocial adaptation and survival in cancer patients, through a review of research (1987–1993). Studies on psychosocial adaptation show that though social support is posited as having a buffering effect for cancer patients, the process linking these factors is unclear. A lack of clarity exists, regarding the use of measures to assess social support, its outcomes, and situations in which it is beneficial. Studies exploring the relationship between support and survival yield inconclusive results. These, in addition to a predominant use of cross-sectional designs and lack of substantive models for guiding research and interventions, comprise major drawbacks. Emphasis should be laid on interactional process between the provider and recipient, longitudinal studies assessing impact of disease stage on interaction, and relationship between social support and quality of life, are required.

AB- Discusses 7 scales assessing psychological functioning (PF) in cancer patients, and provides recommendations for developing future measures through a critical evaluation of these instruments. The instruments were selected from a review conducted on research published in the Journal of Psychosocial Oncology (1986–mid-1993). They measure specific aspects of PF, including, depression, anxiety, psychological symptoms, mood, and adjustment to illness. Critical evaluation of studies using these tools with samples of cancer patients highlight certain issues concerning the validity of these tools. Recommendations include the need for tool validation with relation to population-specific and culture-specific samples, reduction of items and use of specific norms to interpret scale scores. In addition to self-reports, complimentary information from observer ratings, actual behaviors and psychophysiological measures should also be obtained.

AB- Discusses the role and impact of family functioning (FF) on psychological adaptation of cancer patients, by reviewing 4 widely used measures of FF. The concept of FF has been expanded and refined with the use of measurement scales. Four such scales, based on concepts of cohesion, flexibility, communication processes, and interaction among these in the family, are listed. These are, Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale (D. H. Olson, 1993), Family Environment Scale (R. H. Moos, 1974), Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scale (H. I. McCubbin et al., 1989), and Family Adaptability, Partnership, Growth, Affection, Resolve Scale (G. Smilkstein, 1978). They provide a practical evaluation tool of FF for use in clinical practice and research. A review of studies using these measures, demonstrates that the family may be either an important resource in coping, or a source of distress.

KP- statistical & analytical considerations in measurement of individual differences in psychosocial resources & adjustment to cancer
SU- Adjustment; Individual Differences; Measurement; Neoplasms; Psychosocial Factors
AB- Discusses certain statistical and analytical considerations in the research of psychosocial resource variables (PSVs), in order to promote study of individual differences in adjustment to cancer. Tools with established reliability and validity should be used to measure PSVs. Fresh validation data also need to be obtained when using a tool with a population that is different from the normative sample. Traditionally, most resource variables are measured along a quantitative dimension with the use of cut points to obtain scale values. Such practice may lead to an artificial variability that is not representative of the sample. Although PSVs are often related in nonlinear ways, current statistical methods are based on a linear relationship, and hence obscure actual relationships between these variables. Use of multivariate statistical approaches is suggested, in order to differentiate functions of PSVs as mediators and/or moderators. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Themes from conversations included mothers’ worries about their daughters, perceptions of their daughters’ coping, educational information, and clinicians’ willingness or reluctance to communicate directly with daughters about their genetic risk. Letters referred to daughters when informing mothers about autosomal dominant inheritance patterns, psychosocial considerations, and screening recommendations. Results inform the value of educating mothers about how they might discuss these issues with their adolescent daughters.

AB- The authors investigated the relationship of purpose of life, and hope in the happiness and life satisfaction of patients with cancer during or following cancer treatment. Fifty cancer patients were interviewed during recovery in two Warsaw medical centers. The primary measures used were Purpose in Life Test, Herth Hope Index, Happiness and Social Well-Being tools by Czapiński, and the Cantril Ladder of Satisfaction with Life, as well as medical and demographic measures. Purpose in life was correlated with measures of happiness, and satisfaction with life. Hope was correlated with current happiness, and four measures of satisfaction with life. Patients who had cancer longer, that is, duration of disease, showed lower scores for purpose in life, and number of friends. The longer the time of cancer treatment, the lower were patients’ scores for desire for life. Purpose in life and hope were positively correlated with eleven measures of happiness and satisfaction in life. The cancer variables negatively correlated with loss of friends and six variables of happiness, and satisfaction in life, suggesting the impact that having cancer treatment had on patients’ lives. Psychological support in the cancer center was helpful to patients in and out of treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The purpose of this study was to explore body image, physical attractiveness, and femininity among survivors of breast cancer and to examine the effects of the aforementioned variables on depression and quality of life. The participants comprised 70 female survivors of breast cancer, ages between 23 and 79 years. They completed a questionnaire that includes Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, and European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire—Breast Cancer, measuring depression, quality of life, and body image, respectively. On the depression scale, 56% of the participants had scores higher than 16; a score of 16 and above identifies participants with potential depression. Majority of women felt less attractive and less feminine. Low body image, attractiveness, and femininity positively correlated with depression and negatively with overall quality of life. The authors conclude that multidisciplinary health care services relevant to physical attractiveness and femininity of survivors of breast cancer may foster positive body image perceptions, reduced depression, and increased quality of life.

AB- Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent lymphoma that generally responds well to treatment. However, individuals with FL commonly face multiple complex treatment decision-making (TDM) experiences because it frequently follows a relapsing and remitting course. This study explored TDM and distress among individuals with FL (N = 32). Results indicated that most participants reported little decisional conflict or regret and wanted to be actively involved in TDM. However, more than 25% of participants reported clinically-relevant cancer-specific distress, and 60% indicated moderate or higher anxiety symptoms. Research is needed to clarify the cause and course of the psychological distress revealed in this study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study examined the association between different types of perceived social support and adjustment of patients with sarcoma, and if these relationships would differ depending on the outcome measure and phase of disease. Forty-nine patients in the diagnostic phase, 43 in the treatment phase, and 59 in the follow-up phase were recruited. Participants completed the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey Questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment. Positive social interaction, emotional/informational, affectionate, and tangible supports were significantly associated with depression scores, but not with anxiety. Except for affectionate support, all the associations with overall quality of life were significant. A moderating effect of the phase of the disease was also found in the association between tangible support and anxiety, and between affectionate support, depression, and overall quality of life. In clinical practice it is important to implement phase-specific psychosocial interventions and to take into consideration other factors beyond perceived social support while handling patients with sarcoma.

AB- Malignant ovarian neoplasms represent the leading cause of death in gynecological malignancies. Although the majority of ovarian neoplasms occur in women of advanced years, ovarian neoplasms can occur in women of the reproductive age group. Preservation of fertility balanced with treatment of disease is the goal of young patients diagnosed with ovarian neoplasms. A new discipline termed “oncofertility” has emerged; however, several informational gaps exist. Concern has centered on the safety of conservative treatment, the uncertain efficacy of fertility options, the detrimental effects of chemotherapy to remaining reproductive organs, and the timing and execution of fertility workup relative to disease requiring treatment. This study involved an evaluation of young premenopausal women who underwent fertility-sparing surgery for an ovarian neoplasm. Given the rarity of this disease in premenopausal women the objective was to assess the feasibility of this study as defined by the completion rate of the survey. The aim was to broaden our knowledge of patient needs to partner with our survivorship clinic thereby ensuring that patients may facilitate their options. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire titled Ovarian Cancer or Borderline Malignancy of the Ovary: Fertility Sparing Survey and a previously published instrument termed The Sexual Activity Questionnaire, a 21-item scale that assessed the impact of treatment on sexual functioning. All participants completed the survey illustrating the feasibility of the study. The study revealed that the majority of patients (91%) discussed fertility options with their clinicians, yet only 16% engaged in measures to preserve fertility. Patient’s sexual interest and activity was maintained in this cohort of patients. This underscores the importance of continued studies in this unique population to ensure optimal fertility counseling and to better delineate the sexual well-being of young women diagnosed with ovarian neoplasms.

AB- From 2000 to 2007, 11,793 cancer patients received treatment in Kuwait. Non-Kuwaitis accounted for 6,016 (51%) patients. They came from 68 countries, mainly from the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean (59%) and South-East Asian (20%) regions. The majority (69%) was from low- and low-middle income countries. Thirty-seven percent were from non-Arabic speaking countries. To provide culturally-competent care for expatriate patients, there is a need to explore the impact of their ethnic, sociocultural, economic, language diversity, and expatriation-related stressors on different aspects of cancer care.

AB- Considerable research has examined the experiences of women at risk, during diagnosis, and throughout treatment of breast cancer; however, less in known about these women posttreatment. Many women report dealing with extensive long-standing ailments such as lymphedema and fatigue, as well as a fear of illness recurrence. However, women posttreatment also report finding benefit and meaning from their cancer occurrence. These orthogonal outcomes may be related to the uncertainty an individual is able to tolerate. Thus, this online study examined Canadian women who completed treatment for breast cancer (n = 42), and women in a control condition (n = 42), responses to the daily experience of hassles and uplifts, intolerance of uncertainty, coping strategies, and depressive symptoms. Although depressive symptoms and daily hassles did not differ between the two groups of women, women with a previous cancer experience reported a greater amount and frequency of daily uplifts, and hassle intensity predicted fewer depressive symptoms among women posttreatment compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, hassle intensity mediated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and depressive symptoms, but only for women in the control condition. Last, for women posttreatment only, the use of emotion-focused coping to deal with a fear of cancer recurrence mediated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and depressive symptoms, whereas problem-focused, avoidant, or cognitive-restructuring coping strategies did not. These results point to the need to provide resources to women posttreatment, but also that those women who survive breast cancer can obtain benefits from the experience.

AB- Suffering comes in many ways for patients confronting cancer. One of these is an unspecifiable fear about death, which is an existential issue. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between death anxiety and its correlates in cancer patients. Seventy cancer patients were assessed using SCID-I, Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale, the Hospital Anxiety (A) and Depression (D) Scale, the Distress Thermometer, the Visual Analogue Scale for pain (VAS), the Global Assessment of Functioning, and Glock and Stark’s Dimensions of Religious Commitment scales, and these assessments were compared between cancer patients with and without death anxiety. Multiple regression analysis was conducted after correlation analysis between death anxiety and socio-demographic and clinical variables. Axis I psychiatric diagnosis, pain scores, and negative believes about what will happen after death were found to be higher in patients having death anxiety than patients not having death anxiety. Also life expectancy was perceived as shortened in patients with death anxiety. Death anxiety was associated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, and beliefs about what will happen after death. In conclusion, death anxiety could not be regarded as a natural consequence of having cancer; it is associated with the unresolved psychological and physical distress.

Almost all valued the opportunity to receive consultation to address their fertility concerns and discuss fertility preservation options. Psychological stress, time pressure, and costs were identified as main factors affecting respondents’ decision to proceed with in-vitro fertilization to cryopreserve oocytes or embryos. About one third indicated that the discussion of fertility matters was initiated by themselves, their friends, and families rather than their health care providers. The findings have identified several major barriers encountered by female cancer patients when seeking fertility preservation services.

AB- This is a trial of cancer patients who are seriously somatically ill and of how their distress affects their spouse or children. In the pilot phase the authors examined whether there are changes in psychiatric symptom profile of seriously somatically ill and healthy parents between assessments concerning a situation before the onset of parental illness, in current situation before intervention and 4 months after the intervention. The study is a family cluster, randomized, controlled treatment trial for parents and children in families with a parent who has a serious somatic illness. Global Severity Index (GSI) and psychiatric symptom profile of parents was assessed with the Symptoms Checklist-90 for adults. At pilot evaluation phase of the Struggle for Life trial, a total of 19 families (16 patients, 15 spouses) participated in the baseline assessment conducted before intervention, and 10 families (seven patients, seven spouses) also at the 4-month follow-up after the intervention. The interventions used in this study were the short Let’s Talk about Children including two meetings with parents and more intensive Family Talk Intervention consisting of six to eight meetings with parents, children, and whole family. At the 4-month follow-up the GSI score of the patients and spouses was significantly decreased compared to the baseline score. At the baseline the GSI score of the patients was at the same level as that of the psychiatric outpatient sample, whereas at the 4-month follow-up it was at the same level as in the general population. This study lends support to previous studies that recommend that treatment practice should include structured interventions with parents concerning parenting and the wellbeing of children.

AB- This study sought to examine the effects of an expressive talking intervention for 58 caregiving partners of hematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors, persons known to experience distress. Caregivers were randomly assigned to a three-session emotional expression (EE) or control condition. Subjective, objective, and physiologic indicators of emotion were assessed. Relative to controls, EE participants experienced more negative emotion, uttered more negative emotion words, and perceived the exercises as more helpful and meaningful. The trajectory of skin conductance and the use of cognitive mechanism words increased across EE sessions, suggesting sustained emotional engagement. Future research is warranted to determine the optimal dose and timing of EE for this population. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Pain and anxiety are closely associated with bone marrow aspirates and biopsies. To determine whether hypnosis administered concurrently with the procedure can ameliorate these morbidities, the authors randomly assigned 80 cancer patients undergoing bone marrow aspirates and biopsies to either hypnosis or standard of care. The hypnosis intervention reduced the anxiety associated with procedure, but the difference in pain scores between the two groups was not statistically significant. The authors conclude that brief hypnosis concurrently administered reduces patient anxiety during bone marrow aspirates and biopsies but may not adequately control pain. The authors explain this latter finding as indicating that the sensory component of a patient’s pain experience may be of lesser importance than the affective component. The authors describe future studies to clarify their results and address the limitations of this study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Many women with early-stage breast cancer choose breast reconstruction following mastectomy with the goal to improve physical and psychological quality of life. Breast reconstruction procedures vary in surgical complexity, types of postsurgical complications, and time to recovery, all of which can affect a women’s well-being. Although there is a growing body of literature on the satisfaction with aesthetic outcomes following breast reconstruction, there is little research addressing the recovery process. This qualitative study explores woman’s physical and emotional recovery experiences. Findings may be useful for improving educational and counseling services for women who undergo breast cancer reconstructive surgeries.

The therapists were asked to indicate the predominant psychological problems they had dealt with during their five most recently completed interventions. The authors received complete answers from 37 therapists (86%). Anxiety and depression were the two predominant problems most often encountered by therapists during therapy (31% and 29%, respectively). Other problems included relationship problems (23%) and saying farewell to life (21%). In about one half of the cancer patients anxiety and/or depression were not the focus during their therapy.

AB- Although a plethora of studies exist as to the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions with cancer patients, existential, loss, and grief factors are absent. The primary purpose of this exploratory study was to add to the literature by exploring the pre–post effects of an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention on existential well-being, summed self-identified losses, and grief scores as well as assess mental adjustment to cancer; also, 6-month follow-up data as to intervention maintenance were obtained. Sixty-five women, all of whom had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past 12 months, participated in this study. The data indicated significant improvements for existential well-being, number of self-identified losses, grief scores as well as three mental adjustment styles. Six-month follow-up revealed that of the 58 responding participants, 88% were maintaining mindfulness strategies at varying schedules on a weekly basis with mindfulness-based walking as the preferred strategy. This is the first known mindfulness-based intervention study to investigate existential, loss, and grief factors in those with cancer. Further investigations earnestly are needed in this area to provide full psychosocial care to those confronting cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Advances in cancer research and therapy have improved prognosis and the quality of life of many patients. However, previous epidemiological studies in oncologic patients have shown an increased risk of suicide. Suicidal thoughts, relatively well known in those terminally ill, may be just as important for cancer patients who are survivors or are living with the disease. Nonetheless, there is a relative paucity of data about suicidality in this setting. The authors conducted a prospective observational study to identify death thoughts and to explore the factors associated with suicidal ideation in cancer patients. A sample of 130 patients referred for psychiatric consultation was obtained following informed consent and authorization from the local ethics committee. A semistructured interview assessed sociodemographic data, psychosocial support, and information regarding the cancer process and its treatment. Psychometric instruments were used to evaluate psychopathology, namely the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. Psychiatric diagnoses were obtained through the application of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Death ideation was identified in 34.6% of patients, yet only 10% had active suicidal thoughts. Risk of suicide was associated with female gender, a psychiatric diagnosis (major depressive disorder, panic disorder, or dysthymia), difficult interpersonal relationships, associated pain, high hopelessness, and depressive and anxiety symptoms. Although suicidal thoughts are frequent in cancer patients at different stages of disease, most are transitory. Risk factors for suicidal ideation have been identified, such as depression, hopelessness, uncontrolled pain, and difficult interpersonal relationships. Further assessment is necessary to identify those at higher risk of attempting suicide, and underlying psychiatric disorders should be vigorously treated.

AB- Religiosity/spirituality (R/S) is often involved in coping with cancer. Qualitative research effectively captures the individuality of R/S constructs. Fourteen military veteran cancer survivors participated in focus groups. R/S questions included “How have your religious/spiritual beliefs affected how you cope with your cancer” and “How have your religious/spiritual beliefs changed as a result of your experience with cancer?” Five primary themes emerged: impact of cancer on R/S, meaning-making, prayer, religious/spiritual role of others, and facing death. Consistency and individuality characterized the role of R/S in cancer survivorship across themes. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB- The Control Preferences Scale is widely used in decision research to measure patient preferences for participation in treatment decision making with health care providers. Following anecdotal reports of confusion with the scale the authors conducted an exploratory interview study to examine perceptions of the meaning and applicability of the Control Preferences Scale for men with localized prostate cancer seeking treatment in a multidisciplinary urology clinic. The preliminary data suggest potential validity challenges when the Control Preferences Scale is used in a multidisciplinary prostate cancer care setting, including the clinical context of localized prostate cancer and the meaning of shared decision making.

AB- This investigation sought to evaluate the psychological needs of individuals (N = 28) undergoing nephrectomy for newly diagnosed, localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach. The qualitative component consisted of individual semi-structured interviews ≥4 weeks postnephrectomy. The quantitative component involved standardized measures assessing anxiety, depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and general and disease specific quality of life (QOL) prior to nephrectomy and at 4, 12, and 24 weeks postnephrectomy. This investigation provides a unique view of the experiences and needs of persons undergoing surgery for newly diagnosed, localized RCC and reveals that these individuals experience fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.

AB- How do women who seek psychosocial support on the Internet by participating in cancer peer support groups respond to the process of coping with cancer? The current study examines whether older women with cancer have different perceptions about and are influenced to a different extent by online peer support than younger women. The study also explores age-based variations in outlook on coping with cancer as a result of using online support. Separate multivariate regression models estimated the effects of covariates on (1) positive coping affect (PCA) (2) positive coping affect-hopeful (PCA-H), and (3) positive coping affect-proud (PCA-P). A stratified analysis examined variations within age-based subsamples (≥51 and ≤50). Positive coping affect includes feeling proud about coping with cancer from a position of strength and empowerment rather than being a victim and being hopeful for a healthier future postdiagnosis. Online support was found to increase PCA significantly. This finding is consistent across age groups but was more pronounced for older patients. The only exception is that younger women perceive more benefit from using online support in terms of feeling proud. As severity of the symptoms increased, though the younger women increased the amount of time they were online, the older women increased the number of groups they participated in. The study concludes that the Internet might be particularly helpful for older adults who feel helpless to cope with cancer in old age. Online peer support services may help improve the patients’ outlook on fighting with cancer and help them to feel more in control of their health.

AB- The authors sought to examine levels and predictors of posttraumatic growth over one year after surgery in women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer or benign conditions necessitating surgical intervention. Women with advanced-stage cancer (n = 16), early-stage cancer (n = 18), benign gynecologic disease (n = 21), and no disease (n = 14; postannual pelvic exam) completed questionnaires (Perceived Threat, PTSD Checklist [PCL]) 1 week prior to surgery and completed the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) 16 months postsurgery. The four groups’ scores varied significantly on the PTGI. The three disease groups reported higher levels of posttraumatic growth than the no disease group. Higher PCL score presurgery and greater disease severity were positively related to posttraumatic growth, and higher income level was negatively related to posttraumatic growth. Women with gynecologic cancer, regardless of stage, and women with benign gynecologic conditions experience posttraumatic growth.

AB- This study was designed to test the association between social support and depression at different stages of disease progression in men with prostate cancer. Seventy-one men with prostate cancer completed measures of social support and depression three times: T1 (at baseline), T2 (T1 + 2 months), and at T3 (T1 + 4 months). Stage of disease progression was significantly associated with increasing symptoms of depression. Stage of disease progression also moderated the association between social support and depression. Social support was associated with a subsequent worsening of depression for men with early-stage disease. For men with more advanced prostate cancer, social support was associated with improvements in subsequent depression. Social support has different prognostic value for psychological distress among men with prostate cancer depending upon the stage of their disease.

AB- Cancer-related coping strategies and social support, life stress, and optimism were tested in regression analyses as predictors of depression, affect, and quality of life among 54 low-income, immigrant Latina cervical cancer patients. Sixty-seven percent of the patients endorsed symptoms similar to diagnosable depression. Predictors significantly accounted for 35% to 54% of the variance in outcomes. Cancer-related coping strategies were found to mediate several of the relations between life stress, social support, and optimism and outcomes. Findings emphasize the need to consider the context within which patients live when assessing adjustment to cancer and developing culturally-sensitive interventions.

AB- Studies of cognitive effects of chemotherapy among breast cancer patients show that not all women who are exposed to chemotherapy develop cognitive dysfunction and that the observed declines in cognitive functioning may be quite subtle. The use of measures that are sensitive to subtle cognitive decline are recommended yet rarely used among clinical populations. The purpose of this study is to specify the types of memory changes observed among breast cancer survivors treated with chemotherapy and tamoxifen, by using an analytic test of memory, the Doors and People test, which uses age-adjusted norms. The participants were 40 women who were survivors of breast cancer, 20 of whom had completed chemotherapy treatment and 20 women who were treated only with tamoxifen. There were no significant differences between the two groups in overall scores and in all four subtests: visual memory, verbal memory, recall, and recognition measured by age-adjusted scores. Forty percent of patients in both of the groups were classified as having mild impairment in episodic memory. No between-group differences were found in the frequency of subjective, cognitive complaints. Subjective complaints were reported by 69% of patients but were unrelated to objective performance. Memory deficits were observed in breast cancer patients who receive either chemotherapy or tamoxifen alone compared to age-adjusted norms. The Doors and People Test is a sensitive measure of memory deficits that is feasible for use with clinical populations of breast cancer patients in order to monitor changes in cognitive function.

AB- Identifying cancer patients who are experiencing psychosocial challenges during the early phase of oncology treatment can prevent escalating patient distress. Standardized screening methods allow the medical team to identify those at high risk for poor adjustment. The purpose of this study was to provide preliminary psychometric evidence for a brief, self-administered screening instrument, the Psycho-Oncology Screening Tool (POST), designed to evaluate emotional and physical distress, depressive symptoms, and social concerns. Participants included 944 radiation oncology patients who completed the POST prior to their treatment appointment and a subgroup of 516 patients who completed the POST and one of six concurrent validity measures. Psychometric analysis included construct validity evidence provided through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), internal reliability estimates, and concurrent validity estimates assessed with bivariate correlations between POST subscales scores and conceptually similar established measures. A three-factor CFA model was found to produce acceptable model fit, supporting the three domain structure of the POST. Furthermore, the three subscales—emotional and physical distress, depressive symptoms and social concerns—were found to produce acceptable internal reliability estimates (α = .73–.88). Concurrent validity evidence was observed with significant, moderate to large correlations between the POST subscales and all relevant measures (i.e., Profile of Mood States, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue, Beck Depression Inventory, Pain Disability Index, and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List) with correlations ranged from 0.42 to 0.83, p &lt; 0.01. Patients and clinic staff reported no problems administering or completing the POST. Results of this study support the psychometric soundness as well as the feasibility and acceptability of the POST as a brief screening tool for oncology patients receiving outpatient services.

AB- This study highlights psychosocial needs of gynecological cancer survivors, contributing to evaluation of the Cancer Survivors Unmet Needs measure. Of the 45 participants, 28.9% reported clinical anxiety, 20.0% mild-to-severe depression, and 15.6% had probable posttraumatic stress disorder. Strength of unmet needs was associated with anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, poorer quality of life, younger age, and greater time since diagnosis. Linear regressions showed clinical measures, quality of life, optimism, and self-blaming coping style explained 56.4% of strength of unmet needs. Anxiety, functional well-being, posttraumatic stress, and emotional well-being accounted for 40.7% of variance in fear of recurrence, with emotional well-being the strongest predictor.

AB- Adolescent and young adult cancer survivors face unique challenges not systematically addressed by cancer clinicians. Four focus groups and two individual interviews were conducted with 19 survivors to profile experiences and identify key concerns for future interventions. The resultant themes reflect cancer care continuum challenges (such as delays in diagnosis, problems with adherence), psychosocial concerns (such as infertility and reproductive concerns, changing social relationships, financial burden), and the paradox of being diagnosed with cancer as a young adult. Future intervention development for adolescent and young adult survivors should involve patient voices at each stage of the research process.

Next, a field test was conducted among 50 women with breast cancer receiving radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both treatments to examine the use of the monitor in daily practice and to assess physicians’ and patients’ experiences with the monitor. Although patients in general held a positive attitude toward the monitor and compliance was high, patients regularly were unsure about how the quality of life information was used by physicians.

AB- This study investigated the experiences of caregivers of loved ones with cancer in Lomé, Togo. The authors developed a framework that captures the experiences of 17 caregivers. The framework explains the exploratory factors that influenced the lives of caregivers from the caregivers’ own perspectives. Findings showed that even though the caregivers experienced significant challenges that affected their lives and the lives of their families, because of cultural norms and expectations, they tried their best to overcome the challenges. Although some reported positive impacts on their family functioning, others reported negative impacts such as fragmentation of the family unit. Implications for practice and policy are discussed.

AB- The Institute of Medicine recommended that all patients receive survivorship care plans (SCPs) post-treatment to improve quality of follow-up care. However, little is known regarding how survivors utilize SCPs and the congruency between providers’ and survivors’ perspectives. Feedback from colorectal cancer survivors (in receipt of a personalized/individualized SCP) and oncology providers was obtained via interviews. Survivors noted SCPs benefits of reduced duplicative procedures and cancer worry with the synthesized treatment information. Providers noted billing/reimbursement and time investiture (for form completion) as potential barriers. Further investigation of SCPs is warranted regarding utility prior to widespread adoption in follow-up care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Antiandrogen therapy (AAT) is a common adjunct treatment for prostate cancer (PCa) patients and has shown significant benefits to long-term outcomes from radiation or surgery. Although AAT has some adverse side effects and data from breast cancer patients indicate that such side effects from hormonal therapies may contribute to anxiety and depression and may also hinder AAT treatment compliance, this issue has not been investigated within a sample of PCa patients. This study explores the incidence of AAT side effects in a sample of PCa patients, the links between those side effects and anxiety and depression, the possible ways in which these factors may contribute to AAT treatment noncompliance in PCa patients, and how psychosocial treatments might be developed to attend to this issue. 147 PCa patients completed questionnaires on demographic factors, treatment compliance, AAT side effects, anxiety and depression. About 18% of the sample reported AAT side effects, and there was a significant association between the presence of side effects and elevated anxiety and depression scores. Increased frequency of side effects was significantly associated with elevated anxiety, but not depression. The most powerful relationship between AAT side effects and anxiety-depression was for the subfactors of (1) Fatigue, Pain and Discomfort, and (2) Psychological Agitation and Pessimism. Although fatigue, pain, and discomfort may be outcomes of the hormonal treatment itself, psychological agitation and pessimism represent a discrete psychological pathway between AAT side effects and anxiety and depression and (potentially) treatment noncompliance. Methods of addressing patients’ loss of optimism in their treatment outcomes are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Thirty-three African American breast cancer survivors age 45 or younger participated in semistructured phone interviews about psychosocial concerns. Twenty-six percent believed treatment interfered with employment. One third wanted additional emotional support at and after diagnosis. One half felt cancer negatively influenced romantic relationships. Forty-five percent wanted children at diagnosis, but one half these women never received fertility information. One third reported sexual problems, but 73% never discussed sexuality with providers. Fifty-two percent lacked information about cancer-related sexual dysfunction. The strength and spirituality of African American women may facilitate cancer adjustment, but cultural taboos surrounding women's health issues may interfere with successful coping.

AB- Many cancer patients experience spirituality as highly supportive while coping with their disease. Most research as well as most questionnaires in this field is religious orientated. The Spiritual Attitude and Involvement List was developed to enable research on spirituality among religious and nonreligious people. It consists of seven subscales that measure connectedness with oneself, with others and nature, and with the transcendent. Among a student, a healthy population, a healthy interested, a curative cancer, and a palliative cancer sample factorial, convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated, as well as adequate internal consistency and test–retest reliability.

AB- This study explored distress and coping strategies during and after breast cancer treatment. Open ended interview questions were used to explore stress and coping across the illness trajectory and during continuing care. With permission, 49 of the 50 interviews were audiotaped. Interviews also involved the use of the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Ways of Coping (WAYS) and the Lubben Social Support Network Scale (LSNS-6). Data analysis involved a sequential quantitative (dominant)-qualitative (non-dominant) design. A mean-split procedure was used to compare lower and higher distress. The overall IES-R score as well as the Avoidance, Intrusions, and Hyperarousal subscales were all statistically significant between the higher-lower distress groups. Fourteen of the 22 individual IES-R items were significantly different between groups. WAYS subscale scores were not significantly different but 21% of the individual items were. Stress involves (1) physical stressors and (2) psychosocial stressors: (fear of recurrence and family-focused concerns). Coping involves (1) activity-based strategies, (2) cognitive strategies, and (3) spiritual strategies. Breast cancer survivors experience persistent concern about recurrence and uncertainty about the future. Understanding the nature of distress and how women cope during and after treatment are key to improved care for women who have breast cancer.

AB- The objective of this research is to propose a comprehensive model for the prediction of long-term mental health in breast cancer survivors diagnosed 5 to 15 years earlier, compared to female participants referring to the most stressful event that occurred within the last 20 years. Nearly 300 survivors and 132 comparison participants were consulted using a questionnaire, which evaluated personality variables, transactional variables, and current mental quality of life. Structural equation modeling was used. The transactional proposed model was able to account for long-term mental health variance in both groups but was more relevant to women with breast cancer.

AB- Following a diagnosis of breast cancer women experience considerable distress and often present with elevated symptoms of depression. A woman's relationship with her oncologist, and particularly trust in the physician, might influence depressive symptoms, as well as emotional and cognitive reactions to medical decisions made concerning treatment. To assess these relationships, women currently undergoing treatment for breast cancer (n = 40) and women who had previously been treated for breast cancer (n = 74) were asked about (1) trust in their physician, (2) who they blamed for negative events during treatment, (3) who made the treatment decisions, (4) regret, and (5) depressive symptoms. As well, community participants (n = 146) without breast cancer were asked about trust in their physician, levels of depression, and questions regarding blame if they hypothetically had breast cancer. Depression was greatest among women in treatment, and trust in physician was greatest among women posttreatment. However, trust in physician was neither related to depressive symptoms, decision making, nor responsibility for presence of metastases/relapse. Paradoxically, greater trust in physician was related to increased blame of the doctor for other negative events that had occurred. Furthermore, depressive scores were higher among women who blamed their doctor for negative events in comparison to women who ascribed blame to no one. As well, individuals who blamed themselves for negative events reported greater regret than individuals who blamed no one. Thus, though a woman may not hold her physician directly responsible for health outcomes, this relationship may be important to consider in other aspects of her psychological well-being.

AB- Psychological issues following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are unfortunately common. Literature specific to the transplant experience for the needs of adolescents and young adults (AYA) is lacking. The purpose of this article is to (1) describe the allogeneic transplant experience for AYA transplant patients during the first year following transplantation including demographic and treatment characteristics, (2) present AYA data obtained during and following a six-part posttransplant discharge study, (3) illustrate typical AYA experiences using case studies, and (4) propose AYA intervention strategies within Erickson's stages of psychosocial development. A quality of life model provided the research conceptual framework, and the content analysis framework for the qualitative research. Themes that emerged within each domain were the following: sexuality/fertility, fatigue, depression/poor coping/habits, adherence issues, use of technology, dependency issues, changes in roles/relationships, issues with school/education, financial issues, family problems/issues, miscellaneous, religion/spirituality, fear of future, uncertainty, life, death, more life appreciation. These data guide us for providing targeted interventions for the needs of this AYA population. This paper has presented literature and developmental theory, qualitative and qualitative data from an intervention study, and clinical cases in order to propose a developmental treatment model for AYA transplant patients. A coordinated and multidisciplinary approach is needed for the HCT patient who is an AYA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The literature suggests that religiosity helps cope with illness. The present study examined the role of religiosity in functioning among African Americans and Whites with a cancer diagnosis. Patients were recruited from an existing study and mailed a religiosity survey. Participants (N = 269; 36% African American, 56% women) completed the mail survey, and interview data from the larger cohort was utilized in the analysis. Multivariate analyses indicated that in the overall sample religious behaviors were marginally and positively associated with mental health and negatively with depressive symptoms. Among women, religious behaviors were positively associated with mental health and negatively with depressive symptoms. Religiosity was not a predictor of study outcomes for men. Among African Americans, religious behaviors were positively associated with mental health and vitality. Among Whites, religious behaviors were negatively associated with depressive symptoms. These findings suggest a mixed role of religious involvement in cancer outcomes. The current findings may have applied potential in the areas of emotional functioning and depression.

AB- Research conducted with the terminally ill population in relation to death anxiety is rare and mostly outdated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the widely used Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) on a sample of terminal cancer patients. Additionally, validation studies of the DAS have exclusively used traditional statistical methods for analysis. The current study utilized an item response theory technique (IRT), namely the Rasch Rating Scale model for data analysis. The methodology employed may be useful for other researchers conducting validation studies from an IRT perspective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Eighteen evaluated a face-to-face workshop, while 14 completed surveys only. Participants in the workshop group completed the Patient Report of Communication Behavior (PRCB) before and after the workshop and a course evaluation. Participants did not differ on baseline PRCB scores. Posttest scores were significantly higher than pretest scores (p &lt; 0.01). All participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would use the communication skills; 93% agreed or strongly agreed that the skills would improve their health care.

AB- Clinician–parent communication may often be difficult, especially soon after the diagnosis. The aims of this article are to identify the communication strategies associated with expressions of adaptive emotions in parents and to explore the effect of the type of leukemia and of parent’s gender on parents’ expressions of emotions. The data are obtained from 4.622 conversational turns of 20 videotaped interviews with 10 mothers and 10 fathers of children at their first hospitalization for leukemia. A coding scheme for parent emotional expressions was reliably applied by two independent judges. An original self-report questionnaire on parents’ emotional states was used before and after the interview. Positive politeness of interviewer elicits adaptive emotional expressions in parents. Mothers of children with acute myeloid leukemia and fathers of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia appear more distressed during the interview. This interview can be identified as an innovative technique of communication with parents of children with cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Head and neck cancer (HNC) challenges the physical, social, and psychological well-being of the individual, and their family and friends, with 50% of patients facing the prospect of dying within 5 years of diagnosis. To enhance care at the end of life, further understanding of how patients and their loved ones cope is needed. Findings from a qualitative study are presented which suggest that patients with terminal HNC and their caregivers cope individually, with support and as a dyad. Relationship qualities which might facilitate coping together as a dyad are described. These may aid distinction between coping together and acts of social support.

AB- Meeting the supportive care needs of cancer patients remains a challenge to cancer care systems around the world. Despite significant improvements in the organization of medical care of patients with cancer, numerous surveys of cancer populations demonstrate that significant proportions of patients fail to have their supportive care needs met. One possible solution is the introduction of a care coordinator role using oncology nursing to help ensure that patients’ physical, psychological, and social support needs are addressed. Although having face validity, there is little empirical evidence on the effects of nurse-led supportive care coordinator roles on patient reported supportive care outcomes. In this article the authors present the results of a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 113 patients referred to a community-based specialist oncology nursing program. Using validated instruments they found significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes in key supportive care domains: unmet needs, quality of life, and continuity of care, as well as a shift in patterns of health resource utilization from acute care settings to the community over the course of the intervention. The results of this study are important in supporting the design and development of controlled trials to examine provider roles in the coordination of supportive cancer care.

AB- Fertility can be impaired by radiation and chemotherapy among childhood cancer survivors. Therefore, timely and adequate patient counselling about the risk of infertility and preservation methods is needed. The primary study objective was to assess remembered counselling among childhood cancer survivors. As a second objective, the impact of lacking patient counselling on offspring-related attitudes and behaviour was examined. Counselling regarding the late effects of gonadotoxicity that could be recalled by patients was assessed using a questionnaire sent by the German Childhood Cancer Registry. The questionnaire was answered by 2754 adult childhood cancer survivors (53.1% female, mean = 25.7 years). The proportion of patients who could not remember patient counselling about the late effects of chemo-/radiotherapy on fertility decreased significantly over time. In 1980 to 1984 67%, in 2000 to 2004 50% of the patients reported no memories of counselling (p &lt; .001). Counselled patients feared significantly less that their children may have an increased cancer risk (4.4% vs. 6.7%, p = .03). They were also more likely to undergo fertility testing than patients who could not recall counselling (odds ratio = 2.91, 95% confidence interval [2.12, 3.99]). Patients reported an increased memory of patient counselling over the past 25 years. Still, a 50% rate of recalled counselling shows an ongoing need for adequate and especially sustainable counselling of paediatric cancer patients about infertility and other long-term adverse treatment effects. Those who reported a lack of counselling had offspring-related fears more frequently, which stopped them from having children.

AB- To date there has been little research that reveals and describes the connection between the individual and his or her environment, which is the foundation for the coping process. These findings are part of a grounded theory study. The article shows how "the struggle to be a participant in one’s own life" was identified as a central tendency in coping with advanced cancer. It involved a pattern of four life conditions: alleviation from a life-threatening illness, carry on a normal life, live with powerlessness, and find courage and strength, which were characterized by a series of limitations and resources significant to coping.

AB- The authors describe use of psychosocial services within +/− 3 months of diagnosis among male colorectal cancer (CRC) patients treated within the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Analysis included 1,199 patients with CRC treated at 27 VA medical centers primarily diagnosed between the periods 2005 to 2007. Of the patients, 78.6% received some form of psychosocial support, including 50.5% social work, 58.9% chaplain, 6.2% psychologist, 7.1% psychiatry, 3.5% mental health nurse, and 4.4% other. Logistic regression results indicate that rectal cancer patients were less likely to receive psychosocial services (odds ratio = .65, 95% confidence interval [0.43, 0.97]). The majority of patients in the VA receive some type of psychosocial service at the time of CRC diagnosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study assessed the relative screening performance of the Distress Impact Thermometer (DIT) and cutoff levels with the established clinical case threshold of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) among a sample of colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. Fifty-nine CRC survivors completed the DIT, HADS, and provided demographic information at baseline, and 45 of these patients completed the same measures at follow-up, giving a total of 104 participant data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine the accuracy of the DIT compared to the HADS, with a cutoff score ≥8 on each HADS subscale (depression and anxiety) and ≥15 on the HADS total scale used to identify patients with psychological distress. The sample comprised slightly more males (63%) than females, with an average age of 59 years (SD = 9.53) and ranging from 33 to 77 years. The optimum DT cutoff score of ≥5 yielded a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 86.1%; the area under the curve was 0.771 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.646, 0.896]). For the depression subscale, the DT performed better on specificity than sensitivity, however the opposite was true for the anxiety subscale. The addition of an impact thermometer did not enhance screening performance. The results of this study provide support for a DT score of ≥5 for detecting psychological distress among CRC survivors and do not support the addition of an impact thermometer. The use of the DT might underestimate depression but overestimate anxiety. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Therapeutic scrapbooking is an intervention being used with parents and caregivers of children with cancer. The purpose of the group is to promote hopefulness, mobilize internal strengths, and thereby enhance the parents' and caregivers' coping abilities to benefit pediatric oncology patients. Facilitators, licensed in medical social work, provide a safe environment for participants to verbalize their stories and share their distress. Scrapbooking is a “normal” activity without the negative stigma that a “support group” may carry, minimizing the reluctance to attend this supportive group. Outcome measurements indicate this therapeutic intervention achieves positive results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Because physical inactivity is a major factor relating to chronic illnesses affecting Hispanics, the quality of one's health assumes greater importance for vulnerable populations diagnosed with cancer. The purpose of this study was to examine the direct effects of leisure activities and specific household activities on mental and physical health among a group of older Mexican Americans diagnosed with cancer. The study was conducted using data from the second wave of the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (H-EPESE). The authors used a subsample of 61 men and 108 women with a diagnosis of cancer (N = 169). They applied multiple regression analyses to examine the effects of leisure and household activities on four indicators of health: self-reported health, cutting down on activities, satisfaction with life, and depressive symptoms. The results indicated that leisure activity participation and especially heavy household activities were significantly related to self-reported health, cutting down on activities, and depressive symptoms. Implications for practice, policy, and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study explored survivors' perspectives on care delivery and supportive care needs during reentry. Fifty-one individual interviews were conducted with adult leukemia and lymphoma survivors, 3 to 48 months from treatment cessation. Survivors reported poor continuity of care across the patient-survivor transition, difficulty finding appropriate information/services, lack of preparation, lack of support for survivorship issues, and inadequate or poorly timed follow-up as factors contributing to adjustment difficulties at end of treatment and beyond. Improved care coordination is needed after active treatment, including use of an exit interview and delivery of services that are more congruent and better timed to meet ongoing and emergent survivorship needs.

AB- A private ListServ was created as a psychosocial intervention for the caregivers of the brain tumor patients in a large metropolitan cancer center. Caring for someone with a brain tumor can be quite challenging, and the day-to-day responsibilities restrict the amount of discretionary time allotted the caregiver. Consequently, they can become isolated and overwhelmed. It was conceived that, for convenience sake, a ListServ might be the solution to best serve this population. The hope being that sharing with their peers would lessen the isolation and validate their own experience, decreasing their fear and anxiety. This was all possible for less than a dollar a day.

AB- In this prospective, longitudinal study the authors examined changes in cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal components of prostate cancer-related quality of life in 71 men who underwent robotic-assisted prostatectomy for prostate cancer. They identified significant changes across several quality-of-life domains from presurgery to 3-months and 1-year postsurgery. Although some components of quality of life returned to baseline by one year postsurgery, decrements in sexual intimacy, sexual confidence, and masculine self-esteem were enduring. These data can be used to guide patients in their expectations for quality of life following robotic prostatectomy and highlight the need for multidisciplinary approaches aimed at improving men's sexual adjustment after this procedure.

AB- Eighty-nine cancer pain patients participated in a study evaluating components of the Cognitive Adaptation Index on symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Positive correlations were found between optimism, mastery, and self-esteem. Inverse relationships with a PTSD symptom scale were also established. Multiple regression analyses for aggregate PTSD scores, avoidance/numbing, and arousal symptoms were each significant at p &lt; 0.0001, intrusive symptoms at p &lt; 0.020. Except for intrusive symptoms, self-esteem played a statistically significant mediating role for the influence of other variables. These results are discussed regarding their impact on PTSD, intervention strategies, and mental health of individuals experiencing stress.

AB- In an attempt to understand and cope with their diagnosis, individuals with cancer may develop beliefs about the cause of their illness and these causal attributions may impact psychosocial adjustment. Connecticut participants (N = 775) from the American Cancer Society's Study of Cancer Survivors-I completed a self-administered questionnaire assessing beliefs of the cause of their cancer and if they had contemplated the question “why me?” regarding their diagnosis. Written causal belief responses were coded into thematic categories and defined as either in (modifiable) or out (fixed) of an individual's control. Using logistic regression, the authors examined associations between sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial measures and identifying modifiable causal attributions, as well as contemplating “why me.” Most cancer survivors (78.2%) identified one or more causes. Lifestyle and biological factors were most common, whereas psychological factors were least common, with some variation by cancer type. After multivariate adjustment, only cancer type was associated with identifying modifiable causes. Participants who contemplated “why me” (47.5%) were more likely to be younger and reported a greater number of cancer-related problems. In conclusion, the majority of cancer survivors reported specific causal attributions, and many had contemplated “why me.” Understanding and assessing causal attributions and more general existential questions regarding diagnosis could aid in our understanding of survivors' adjustment and psychosocial well-being. Additional research in large populations is also needed to determine if other characteristics are associated with identifying modifiable causal attributions and asking “why me.” (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Recent research has established the important beneficial relationship between exercise and cancer rehabilitation and survivorship. However, the complexities of this interrelationship are as yet underexplored. This article presents the findings of a recent qualitative research study that examined the psychosocial benefits associated with involvement in an exercise club (the Chemo Club) specifically designed for cancer patients during or postchemotherapy from the perspectives of the patients.

AB- The survivorship of children diagnosed with cancer has risen during the last decade. After the end of treatment those children and their families return to the community where another period of crisis unfolds. In this article, the findings of a larger qualitative study in Puerto Rico related to the return to the community of these patients and their families are discussed, including financial difficulties, the burden of responsibility, and transition to school. These findings provide a rationale for the implementation of a bio-psycho-social model of health that emphasizes reciprocal interactions among the multiple systems in which these families are embedded.

AB- The overall aim was to describe and compare well-being, social life, and quality care among parents of children with cancer with respect to mothers versus fathers and whether the children were on versus. off treatment. The Life Situation Scale for Parents (LSS-P) was answered by 320 parents, comprising 85 mothers and 71 fathers of children on treatment, and 93 mothers and 71 fathers of children off treatment. The results show that the well-being of parents of children with cancer is affected by their child's situation, and that they experience such things as economic strain and a sense of being dependent on the care provided, especially during the child's treatment phase. Mothers whose children are receiving treatment see their life situation as less satisfying, and report being sadder and having lower self-esteem.

AB- Benign breast biopsy (BBB) can be distressing for many women. Few studies have examined specific aspects of the BBB more or less distressing or risk factors for distress. Women (N = 51) who had a recent BBB reported the magnitude of distress associated with specific aspects of their experience. Clinical and demographic variables were also examined as risk factors for distress. All women reported some distress associated with the BBB with one third reporting their experience was “very stressful.” Generally, biopsy-specific events were more distressing than follow-up mammography. Distress risk factors included younger age, less education, nonsurgical biopsy, and no family history of breast cancer. Clinical efforts to better manage biopsy-related distress are warranted. The authors identified clinical and demographic risk factors that furnish a simple, efficient, and potentially cost-effective means of stratifying risk for distress in the breast biopsy setting.

AB- Given that more than one third of some cohorts of cancer survivors exhibit post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, this study examines how trauma outcomes might relate to quality of life (QOL). Eight hundred thirty survivors of adult lymphoma were assessed for PTSD, post-traumatic growth (PTG) and QOL. Structural equation modeling revealed that QOL was best explained by the model in which stressors (e.g., co-morbidities) were mediated by PTSD and PTG. Trauma outcomes mediated the relationship between specific stressors and QOL. These findings support using PTSD and PTG as a diagnostic framework in understanding symptomatology in survivors.

AB- Despite a growing literature on the psychosocial impact of the threat of cancer recurrence, underserved populations, such as those from the Appalachian region, have been understudied. To examine worry and perceived risk in cancer survivors, Appalachian and non-Appalachian cancer patients at an ambulatory oncology clinic in a university hospital were surveyed. Appalachians had significantly higher worry than non-Appalachians. Cancer type and lower need for cognition were associated with greater worry. Those with missing perceived risk data were generally older, less educated, and lower in monitoring, blunting, and health literacy. Additional resources are needed to assist Appalachians and those with cancers with poor prognoses (e.g., liver cancer, pancreatic cancer) to cope with worry associated with developing cancer again. More attention for cancer prevention is critical to improve quality of life in underserved populations where risk of cancer is greater.

AB- The Mental Health Assessment and Dynamic Referral for Oncology (MHADRO) is a program that conducts a computerized assessment of physical, psychological, and social functioning related to oncology treatment, prints personalized summary reports for both the patient and the provider, and for those who provide consent, faxes a referral and assessment summary report to a matched mental health treatment provider (i.e., dynamic referral). The functionality, feasibility, and end user satisfaction of the MHADRO were tested in a comprehensive care center. Of the 101 participants enrolled, 61 (60%) exhibited elevated distress on at least one of the mental health indices, and, of these, 12 (20%) chose a dynamic referral for mental health services. Patients and health care providers exhibited high levels of satisfaction with the program. The MHADRO has potential for assisting in meeting the psychosocial needs faced by individuals with cancer and should be tested further for its facilitation of mental health treatment initiation.

AB- There is an increasing awareness that there are often aspects of the experience of cancer that patients view as positive or beneficial despite substantial physical and psychological impacts. Individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC) are unique with respect to the possible facial disfigurement and functional limitations following disease and treatment. This qualitative study aimed to explore whether patients with HNC experience positive consequences posttreatment, and to investigate the nature of any benefit finding. Emerging master themes included a change in life priorities, greater closeness to family and friends, a greater awareness of self, for example, an increase in self-confidence and empowerment, and a greater awareness of faith and spirituality. Despite the adverse affects often associated with HNC, patients report some degree of positive growth following treatment.

AB- The study explores differences and similarities in needs for and experiences with emotional support among Danish-born and migrant cancer patients. Qualitative narrative interviews with 18 adult cancer patients were conducted. Analysis was inspired by phenomenological methods. Migrant patients experienced more dispersed social networks compared to Danish-born patients. However, common difficulties in asking for and receiving emotional support were related to cancer being perceived as a fatal disease among the social network, and this lead to fear among patients that articulating needs for support would result in loss of normality and nonpatient identity.

AB- This qualitative study describes experiences of cancer care delivery for nine African-American breast cancer patients. Three focus groups captured participants’ experiences with the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and parenting their children. Spontaneous accounts describing their interactions with oncology staff were reported by all breast cancer patients. Content analysis revealed five themes: interaction with physicians, power and authority of physicians, collaboration between physicians and mental health professionals, navigating the system, and involvement of the family in the treatment process. These themes may help in developing culturally sensitive training programs for oncology providers to improve the quality of cancer care.

AB- To determine the presence and nature of variability in anxiety and depression in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) over 3 years following diagnosis, 442 patients with PCa completed standardized anxiety and depression inventories via survey between 1 and 36 months after receiving their initial diagnosis. Data were analyzed from a series of 3-month cohorts, and results indicated that total scores and incidence of clinically significant anxiety and depression varied over time, but that this variability was restricted to specific subfactors of anxiety and depression. Provision of effective psychological treatment to patients with PCa is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The goal of this research was to understand the barriers and challenges that African American cancer survivors experience after being diagnosed with cancer. The authors provided 20 cancer survivors and caregivers with cameras to take pictures of their needs right after they were diagnosed with cancer. Most importantly, a major theme that arose from the participants’ responses was the lack of culturally-specific support services located within their neighborhoods. Other needs included lack of social support, a lack of resources related to appearance, a lack of resources for continued care, and especially a lack of support services for children of survivors.

AB- Breast cancer survivors often use clues to convey their concerns to their oncologists. The authors conducted a randomized trial of a communication coaching intervention in which 22 female breast cancer survivors were randomized to the coaching and 22 to treatment as usual. They hypothesized that the intervention would increase breast cancer self-efficacy, improve mood, and reduce fears of recurrence. Through a series of ANCOVAs they found that the intervention led to increases in self-efficacy. Changes in self-efficacy predicted changes in anxiety, depression, and womanhood fears. This coaching intervention shows promise but requires additional studies to establish is efficacy and effectiveness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The final scale is the result of an iterative interview process with the 28-item scale administered to 285 participants. Factor analysis demonstrated with seven domains: physical, sexual and cognitive function, body image, coping, social support, and anxiety. Cronbach’s alpha is .88. Convergent and divergent validity are also reported. The Long Term Quality of Life–Breast Cancer Scale has domains specific to breast cancer and will be useful to psychosocial and clinical researchers.

AB- This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of an online peer support group intervention for women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Feasibility, participation rates, participant satisfaction, and preliminary outcomes are examined from a 1999 to 2000 study of online peer support groups for women with MBC. Thirty women with MBC were randomly assigned to either an immediate online support condition or a waitlisted control condition. For practical and ethical reasons, the waitlist period was limited to 2 months. Six monthly assessments were collected using standardized measurement instruments. Intervention retention rates (73%), assessment completion rates (range = 100%–86% in retained participants) and support group participation (M = 5.9 days per week) were high compared to other published studies on this population. Reported satisfaction with the intervention was also high. An online support intervention study is feasible using a waitlist control. Despite the feasibility and acceptability of the study procedures, the study design and small sample size precluded definitive conclusions about intervention effectiveness. As such, study procedures should be replicated with a larger more representative sample to examine the effectiveness of the intervention.

AB- The American Cancer Society estimates that 200,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Among these, 1–6% will be diagnosed with a far more aggressive and little studied form, inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Because its presenting symptoms are atypical, IBC is often mistaken for mastitis or other conditions, resulting in dangerous delay in accurate diagnosis and treatment. Little is written about coping with IBC. This qualitative study explores stressors and challenges women face in coping with diagnosis, treatment and living with IBC, in order to help providers understand and meet the unique needs of women with this disease.

AB- A cross-sectional study was conducted with 50 African American head and neck cancer survivors. Common coping strategies were identified and examined in relation with quality of life and relationship well-being. Coping through support from God, seeking emotional support from family and friends, and helping others were the most commonly used strategies. Having emotional support, being strong and self-reliant, and engaging in distracting activities with family and friends had strongest associations with quality of life. Coping through emotional support, help from God, assistance from one’s church family to maintain religious practices, helping others, and engaging in distracting activities with others was more strongly associated with relationship well-being. Future intervention studies should consider these strategies and their possible impact on the physical, psychological, and relationship well-being of this population.

AB- This article explores the relationships between communication and social support of parents of children with cancer (N = 44), and the importance of gender-role conflict in fathers. Structural equation modeling and the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model were used to test the expected relationships between communication, social support, gender-role conflict, and anxiety, and to control for sample nonindependence. Results suggest communication increases perceived emotional and instrumental social support between parents, and instrumental support from fathers results in less anxiety for mothers. When fathers experienced more conflict about their role as financial supporter for the family (i.e., career achievement gender-role conflict), fathers perceived less instrumental and emotional support from their wives. However, fathers who experienced more conflict about career achievement were also less anxious. A second measure of fathers’ gender-role conflict (i.e., emotional expression) was unrelated to either mothers’ or fathers’ outcomes. The role of gender, communication, and social support in the context of pediatric oncology is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The goal of this research was to better understand the impact of prostate cancer and its treatment on a broad range of aspects of men’s sexual well-being. Interviews were conducted with 19 men. The men ranged in age from 49 to 74 years and were 1 to 5 years posttreatment. Our results suggest that some but not all aspects of men’s sexual well-being are affected by treatment for prostate cancer. Further, the specific aspects that were affected as well as their emotional impact varied considerably from individual to individual. Most of the men reported that, prior to diagnosis and treatment, they engaged in regular sexual activity and that they had been satisfied or very satisfied with their sexual relationship. Following treatment, most (but not all) of the men reported no change in the amount and type of affection expressed, the quality of their romantic relationship, their self-concept as a man, or their sexual desire. In contrast, nearly all of the men described negative changes that were distressing to them in erections, orgasmic consistency, and sexual satisfaction. Further, most of the men believed that their sex life was over due to their erectile difficulties and so had stopped engaging in any sexual activity with their partner, although one third of them continued to masturbate. Five themes emerged with respect to factors that either contributed to or buffered the emotional impact of these changes: partner responses to changes in sexual functioning, effectiveness of medical treatments, communication with their partner about sexual functioning, acceptance of or resignation to sexual changes, and communication with physicians about sexual functioning. Finally, most participants felt that the health care system did not respond adequately to their needs. These results are discussed with respect to the importance of facilitating sexual communication between partners and between patients and health care providers.

AB- Past research has suggested that dispositional cancer worry may be a key predictor of health behavior. The current study examined seven measures of dispositional cancer worry to see if they were significantly related (convergent validity), significantly different from similar but distinct traits (divergent validity), and capable of predicting cancer-relevant outcomes (predictive validity). Four hundred and eighty nine undergraduate students completed a survey measuring dispositional worry, dispositional cancer worry, and perceived cancer risk. Factor analysis identified four underlying dimensions that explained 67.3% of the variance in dispositional cancer worry: severity (42.8%), frequency (12.3%), psychological reactance (6.9%), and worry impact (5.3%). Four existing measures of dispositional cancer worry were found to represent each of these dimensions. In general, dispositional cancer worry measures were highly correlated with one another and only moderately correlated with measures of dispositional worry, supporting strong convergent and divergent validity. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that dispositional cancer worry measures predicted significant variance in cancer-relevant outcomes above and beyond dispositional worry. The results of the current study support the notion that dispositional cancer worry and dispositional worry are distinct constructs. Furthermore, two dimensions of dispositional cancer worry (severity and frequency) seemed to have the strongest convergent, divergent, and predictive validity.

No patients reported post-traumatic stress disorder at a diagnosable level (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist–Civilian). The majority of survivors (≥ 75%) reported a positive impact of cancer on their lives (Impact of Cancer Scale) and excellent social support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey). However, a subset of survivors reported needing more help than was received regarding emotional problems (28.9%). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The objective of this study was to study differently composed cancer support groups to generate insights into what groups are attractive to the widest range of participants, and how they might be best structured and composed. This study applied a qualitative design utilizing participant observation at three cancer support groups (a group for women with metastatic cancer, a colorectal cancer support group, and a group for Chinese cancer patients) and in-depth interviews (N = 23) with group members as the primary data collection methods. Despite the diverse composition of the groups, their perceived benefits were similar, and informants highlighted the information, acceptance, and understanding they received in the support group environment. However, gender and cultural differences were found in attendance patterns and the desired content of group meetings. Importantly, participants’ motivations for attending cancer support groups also changed as they moved through the treatment trajectory: over time the need for information was at least partially replaced by a need for support and understanding. This study supports prior research findings that there is no ideal support group, nor is there a “magical formula” for attracting and retaining a diverse audience. However, including an educational component in support groups may increase the participation of currently underrepresented populations such as men and patients from culturally diverse backgrounds.

The authors found that most respondents’ core support networks were their families, and social support came in several forms including emotional, tangible, and informational. However, the authors also found that many respondents relied on a distinct form of social support, experiential support, which has not been identified in current research. Experiential support is defined as a relationship with someone who has gone through a similar illness and can help provide firsthand information, insight, and even hope. The authors conclude that experiential support is an important area for future research on social support and health outcomes.

A total of 251 bereaved relatives ages 14 to 76 (M = 41.3, SD = 16.8) were recruited at a counseling service for cancer patients and their relatives. The prevalence of current probable PTSD was 40% in the bereaved sample. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis indicated that full-time employment, perceived control, and a secure attachment style moderated the risk for PTSD. Moreover, a long period of caretaking, high levels of somatization, and dissociation were all associated with an increased risk of PTSD.

AB- This study compared VO2peak, treatment frequency and dosage, and QOL between 22 post-treated breast cancer survivors (CATotal) and 22 apparently healthy, age-matched women (CO). The CATotal group included 11 with no history of any other co-morbidities (CA) and 11 with controlled hypertension (CA + H). VO2peak was measured using the Bruce Protocol. QOL was measured using the SF-36 survey. Significant differences were observed in VO2peak between CATotal and CO (p = 0.014), CA and CA + H (p = 0.001), and CA + H and CO (p = 0.001). Physical, emotional, and mental health domains of the SF-36 were significantly different between CATotal and CO (p = 0.006, 0.001, and 0.05 respectively). These results suggest that breast cancer survivors with controlled hypertension can experience a significant reduction in VO2peak when compared to apparently healthy, age-matched controls. Also, treatment frequency and dosage affected QOL in this group of survivors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Cancer survivorship experiences were explored among Hispanic men and women with cancer and family members of cancer survivors, recruited from two rural Washington communities in the Lower Yakima Valley. Five focus groups were conducted from February 2006 to October 2007 with 31 women and 10 men. Disbelief, fear, sadness, strength, courage, faith, and hope were common reactions to diagnosis. Concerns about family/children, losing medical coupons, and feelings of depression/isolation were identified as challenges faced after diagnosis. Participants identified smoking and environmental exposures as causes of cancer, but many believed operating on tumors caused cancer to spread. Participants used conventional treatments but identified herbal/natural remedies as cures. Most participants reported negative experiences with physicians and believed their community would benefit from language-appropriate information regarding prevention and treatment. The importance of linking survivors through support groups was emphasized and information elicited from sessions has been used to organize survivor support groups in these two communities.

The current study retrospectively evaluated the presence of physical or severe psychological abuse before cancer diagnosis, during treatment, and after remission of cancer in a sample of 206 ethnically diverse breast cancer survivors and 206 age- and ethnicity-matched control participants. Breast cancer survivors were less likely than controls to report abuse and did not report significant changes in frequency of abuse after cancer diagnosis or treatment.

Descriptions of the side effects experienced by 10 hematology patients undergoing steroid treatment are documented and discussed. Steroid usage can have a range of physical and emotional side effects on patients, including hematology patients. The insights are a serious reminder to all who care for hematology patients that the psychological and psychiatric side effects of steroids need to be taken seriously.

AB- Cancer is a major health issue that affects a significant proportion of the population. Advancements in oncology treatment have reduced mortality, creating an ever-greater need for psychosocial oncology. Patients with cancer at Grand River Regional Cancer Centre (GRRCC) have access to some psychosocial intervention (e.g., wellness workshops, social work intervention); however, the extent to which these efforts meet patients’ current needs is not known. The purpose of the exploratory survey was to assess patients’ psychosocial needs and psychosocial oncology service needs. Patients receiving treatment for cancer at GRRCC were asked to participate in the anonymous survey. Two research assistants from the University of Guelph obtained informed consent, then with assistance from volunteers from the GRRCC, collected all data. The two screening tools, and standardized, self-report measures of depression and social support (Perceived Social Support Scale) were administered. Patients rated the psychosocial oncology services as very helpful, though 100% indicated the presence of distress. The main source of distress concerned not knowing what their personal outcomes will be. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

AB- This article presents a case study for skills-directed intervention aiming to help healthy siblings of children with cancer control their emotions and gain self-control skills. Case study application of the intervention was with a boy aged 9 years and 8 months who had the verbal, cognitive, and motivational ability to learn and apply the skills. Intervention included the “Feeling Wheel” to enhance emotional identification, expression, understanding, acceptance, and control. Intervention also focused on teaching him to observe his automatic thoughts, change them to mediated ones, engage in internal dialogue, and seek/adopt alternative behaviors to gain self-control. In postintervention feedback, he reported less anxiety than previously, less inclination toward negative thinking, and more empowerment to deal with day-to-day difficulties he encountered.

AB- Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in American women, and lung cancer is the deadliest. The etiology of breast cancer is not clear, although 85% of lung cancers are explained by cigarette smoking. A research review of the social perception of serious illness has shown that causal explanations fall into two categories: (1) patient behavior and (2) factors outside the patient’s control. Presented in this review are questions concerning (1) patient coping, (2) stigma, and (3) the responses of the health care and research communities. Suggestions are made for further study of the social perception of lung and breast cancers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The present analyses were conducted to examine demographic and clinical variables associated with mood and health-related distress in a sample of 440 women completing primary treatment for early-stage breast cancer. The authors’ aim was to test the hypothesis that higher levels of self-efficacy and perceived preparedness for the end of treatment—the reentry phase—are associated with better mood and lower health-related distress in this sample. Women who had received chemotherapy and who were younger (&lt;50 years) had significantly higher mood disturbance and health-related distress scores. Younger age, preparedness, and self-efficacy predicted 36% of the variance in mood disturbance scores. Self-efficacy and age predicted 26% of the variance in health-related distress. Although further research is needed, our findings suggest that self-efficacy and perceived preparedness represent important constructs to target in the development of interventions for women at the reentry transition.

AB- This article inquires into whether and how uncertainty reduction theory and problematic integration theory, two theories relevant to social support as enacted within a chapter of the Man-to-Man prostate cancer support group, inform us of how such groups can assist group members most effectively. Interview data from members of a prostate cancer support group shed light on theoretical assumptions about uncertainty. Although the group applies elements of both theories, prostate cancer survivors likely would benefit from a more comprehensive and flexible treatment of social support theory.

AB- The aim of this exploratory study was to describe disclosure preferences about serious illness among Korean American older adults. Three focus groups (N = 6, 8, and 9) were conducted with Korean Americans age 65+ from two senior centers and a primary care practice in NYC. Six themes were identified: (1) Disclosure allows patients to make decisions and preparations, (2) Disclosure may cause emotional distress and hasten death, (3) Disclosure may be based on physician error or inability to know prognosis, (4) Disclosure should be based on severity of illness and the need to maintain hope, (5) Disclosure should be based on age, and (6) Disclosure practices of physicians vary by culture. Providing culturally competent care to East Asian older adults requires understanding the importance of family values and traditions, but not making assumptions about the degree to which the patient adheres to these beliefs.

AB- Photovoice is a participatory research methodology in which individuals photograph their everyday realities. The present study used photovoice to understand the impact of cancer on a sample of six young adult survivors of childhood cancer (YACS) and their family members. The themes of the YACS group included, in their own words, “lost childhood,” “my culture,” “health,” “what keeps me going/sacrifices,” and “who am I?” Those of the family group included “how cancer affected survivors’ hopes and dreams?,” “positive impact of cancer,” “importance of information,” “barriers to self-care,” and “what we learned and what we can do.” The family-based and participants-driven framework and photovoice produced some novel findings that call for YACS-targeted guidance and training on social relationships, independence, and career; support for the families from family-oriented cultures; and facilitation of family dialogue.

AB- Research has focused heavily on mother’s experiences of children with life-threatening illnesses. In contrast, fathers’ experiences, especially among minorities, are scarcely discussed. This study examined the experiences of 15 fathers as primary medical caretakers of children diagnosed with cancer or sickle cell disease. Using a life story method, fathers completed semistructured interviews regarding their overall experiences. Data was analyzed using narrative analysis with multiple case studies. Results indicated single, low socioeconomic status, and immigrant fathers with limited English proficiencies were at highest risk for coping difficulties. This study also examined gender biases that men experienced and masculine norms in coping. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study’s objective is to identify women’s breast cancer risk perceptions and their attitudes and knowledge on screening tests. The cross-sectional research. Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey. The population of 188 females who applied for gynecological examination. The study employed a semistructured questionnaire form. Questions such as female’s demographic data, attitudes based on screening tests of breast cancer, family history, perceived risk breast cancer, and questions with regard to patients’ fear of breast cancer were included in the survey. In this study, it is determined that the rates of the women, who conduct breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography at least once, are very low. The reason for not performing the BSE was declared with a rate of 50.8% as “Do not know how to perform.” Of the women 20.2% were fully acknowledged about BSE. Nearly half of the women perceived 50% or more risk of developing breast cancer, and this rate increases as they get older. The risk perception and educational status increased CBE and mammography rates and BSE knowledge positively, but because of insufficient BSE application abilities BSE rate cannot increase as expected. It is recommended that nurses put forward the initiatives in training programs to increase women’s BSE abilities. In planning such an education program risk perception and information of women about breast cancer should be considered.

AB- Growing attention has focused on relationships between religious coping and health outcomes among cancer patients. However, surprisingly little is known about religious coping among family caregivers. Moreover, few studies have been conducted outside of Western developed nations. This investigation evaluated family caregivers in Pune, India. The authors examined discrete dimensions of cancer-specific religious coping, and their associations with posttraumatic growth, among families at a similar phase of treatment. As hypothesized, posttraumatic growth was associated with increased use of positive religious coping strategies and diminished use of negative coping strategies. In multivariate analyses, the strongest predictors were benevolent religious reappraisals and punishing God reappraisals. Findings underscore the importance of meaning-focused religious coping.

To investigate patients’ needs and experiences we conducted semistructured interviews with eight patients. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed according to grounded theory and a typological approach. Patients’ needs and experiences concurred with a patient-centered approach in many aspects. The threat perceived by patients following diagnosis strongly influenced their needs and experiences. Three different types of patients were identified: emotionally needy, active, and trustful, adaptive. The typology identified in this study may help physicians to adequately adapt their behavior.

AB- The aim of this study was to evaluate a manualized cognitive behavioral group intervention for early-stage breast cancer patients. Sixty-nine women were recruited at an Irish specialist oncology hospital and assigned to a 6-week cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program or an educational control group. Participants were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6-month follow-up. Groups × Time (2 × 3) ANOVAs showed that the program did not lead to greater improvement on standardized measures of coping, quality of life, or mood compared with the control group. Regression analyses showed that maladaptive coping and distress at baseline were predictive of psychological adjustment at follow-up. Level of distress was also predictive of quality of life at follow-up. Repeated measures ANOVAs of data from cases in the intervention group showed that patients who completed the program showed significant improvement in problem severity, impact of problems, coping ability, and goal attainment from pre- to posttreatment, and these gains were maintained at follow-up for problem severity and impact of problems, but not for coping ability or goal attainment. Participation in the program did not lead to less health service usage during the period from baseline to follow-up, compared with the educational control group. A controlled trial provided limited evidence for the effectiveness of brief cognitive behavior intervention in enhancing psychological adjustment of early-stage breast cancer patients with nonclinically significant levels of psychological distress. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of the program for patients with elevated levels of psychological distress and limited coping resources.

Two hundred and thirty cancer patients and caregivers completed an online survey regarding their experiences searching for and discussing with their doctors cancer-related Internet information. Participants who assertively introduced the Internet information in a consultation were more likely to have their doctor agree with the information. When doctors showed interest and involvement and took the information seriously, participants were less likely to report a desire to change the doctor’s response. Taking the information seriously was also associated with greater satisfaction. This preliminary evidence that the doctor’s response is associated with patient outcomes indicates the potential for improving patient-centered communication. In an effort to maximize patient-centered communication, doctors should be encouraged to take their patients and the information they present seriously, as well as show their patients that they are interested and involved.

AB- Numerous sound scientific studies (cross-sectional and longitudinal) have found a positive correlation between religion and physical and mental health. In particular, there is evidence that demonstrates that religion helps cancer patients better adjust to and cope with their disease, at least psychologically. However, some research suggests that mediating factors associated with religion may explain the positive effects of religion on health. This article argues that even if this is the case, there is still intrinsic value to religion in that the mediators themselves are strongly connected to religion, and therefore religion is important to the patient in terms of coping, support, hope, and meaning. This has possible important implications for clinical practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objective: To develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a measure of motivation and life outlook (Getting-Out-of-Bed [GoB]). Design: Secondary analysis of baseline and 6-month data from a longitudinal follow-up study of older breast cancer survivors. Participants: Women (N = 660) diagnosed with primary breast cancer stage I—IIIA disease, age ≥65 years, and permission to contact from an attending physician in four geographic regions in the United States (city-based Los Angeles, California; statewide in Minnesota, North Carolina, and Rhode Island). Measurement: Data were collected over 6-months of follow-up from consenting patients' medical records and telephone interviews with patients. Data collected included the 4-item GoB, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), breast cancer, sociodemographic, and health-related characteristics. Results: Factor analysis produced, as hypothesized, one principal component with eigen values of 2.74baseline and 2.916-months which explained 68.6%baseline and 72.7%6-months of total variance. In further psychometric analyses, GoB exhibited good construct validity (divergent: low nonstatistically significant correlations with unrelated constructs; convergent: moderate statistically significant correlations with related constructs; discriminant: distinguished high HRQoL groups with a high level of significance), excellent internal reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.84baseline, 0.876-months), and produced stable measurements over 6-months. Women with GoB scores ≥50 at baseline were more likely at 6-months to have good HRQoL, good self-perceived health, and report regular exercise, indicating good predictive ability. Conclusion: GoB demonstrated overall good psychometric properties in this sample of older breast cancer survivors, suggestive of a promising tool for assessing motivation and life outlook in older adults. Nevertheless, because it was developed and initially evaluated in a select sample, using measures with similar but not exact content overlap further evaluation is needed before it can be recommended for widespread use.

AB- We evaluated a new measure, the Cancer and Deity Questionnaire (CDQ), which assesses perceived relations with God after a cancer diagnosis. Based on object relations theory, the 12-item CDQ assesses benevolent and abandoning God representations. Sixty-one older participants with recent cancer diagnoses completed the questionnaire at baseline, and 52 of these participants completed the same questionnaire at follow-up. Internal consistency was excellent for the Benevolence scale (α = .97) and good for the Abandonment scale (α = .80). Moderate correlations with the Spiritual Well-Being Scale support divergent validity. Correlations between CDQ scales and the Styles of Religious Coping scales support convergent validity. The CDQ is brief, easily scored, practical for psycho-oncology research, and adaptable for use with other illnesses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Breast cancer survivors experience cognitive difficulties following chemotherapy, yet the effects of these deficits on functional outcomes have not been systematically evaluated. This study assessed the relationships between postchemotherapy cognitive difficulties and functional outcomes. Forty-six women with breast cancer were seen at 1-month postchemotherapy; data were collected on cognitive functioning, psychological variables, and physical symptoms. Wilcoxon signed-rank analyses revealed cognitive deficits in executive functioning and verbal fluency. Subsequent regression analyses demonstrated that poorer executive functioning was associated with decreased productivity, community involvement, and social role functioning. Poorer quality of life was predicted by depression and reluctance to seek social support, but not cognitive functioning. These findings indicate that executive functioning deficits are associated with important functional outcomes among breast cancer survivors 1-month postchemotherapy. Thus, treatment efforts should focus on addressing cognitive, as well as psychological and physical, issues among cancer survivors.

Eight chemotherapy sessions were video recorded and then analyzed for emerging themes. In addition, the videotapes were used in a reflective process with nurses. The findings showed that nurses were efficient in communicating about the physical and medical care of patients but were hesitant in exploring emotional issues. This study highlights the focus on physical symptoms and side effects by nurses in this setting. It also supports the need for further education and training in psychosocial assessment during chemotherapy administration.

AB- Our prior research found that 43% of women with cancer relied on more than one person for advance care planning (ACP) and support. We conducted this follow-up study to address the stability of patient choices around ACP and providers' knowledge of patients' named supports. Living participants from the original survey were recontacted and asked to participate in this study. Of the original 215 participants, 113 (66%) participated. The median time between surveys was 23 months. At resurvey, 33 (26%) patients did not name the same person to all three roles. Controlling for age, race, partner status, tumor type, and remission status, naming one person for all three roles was associated with higher concordance at follow-up for primary support (PS) and health care proxy (HCP). Comparing patients' and providers' responses (N = 162), concordance was 71% for emergency contact (EC), 60% for PS, but only 51% for HCP. In this follow-up study, a smaller percentage of women named more than one person to the roles of EC, PS, and HCP compared to the original survey. Of concern, concordance between patient and provider was low, particularly for HCP. This was notable especially when responses changed over the interval time, and when ACP and PS roles were split between multiple people. Understanding the network of people who serve ACP and support roles may be important as we seek to improve the process of ACP and surrogate decision making.

AB- Through focus groups and individual interviews, data were gathered on the emotional, informational, and instrumental support needs of 22 immigrant Latina women. A thematic analysis revealed that participants who perceived to receive social support reported less psychological distress and better adjustment to breast cancer than those who did not perceive this support. Types and sources of support varied across survivorship stages. Many needs were related to financial, linguistic, and cultural barriers participants encountered in the course of the disease. Based on the findings, we conclude with several clinical recommendations to improve the quality of life in this medically under served population.

AB- The article aims to understand the coping strategies of post surgery head and neck cancer patients in Mumbai, India. A descriptive research design with a sample of 80 patients suffering from head and neck cancer was selected to analyze their coping strategies in relation to socio demographic profile and illness characteristics. The findings of the study highlighted that the spiritual methods of coping (such as prayer and meditation, adopting a positive attitude) were the most frequently used mainstream coping strategy, apart from other traditional methods (such as taking medications, indulging in exercise and activities to divert one’s attention, etc.) of coping. The findings of the study help to broaden the understanding of various psychosocial aspects faced by the patient in India and provide progressive recommendations to improve the quality of life of the patient suffering from cancer.

The sample consisted of 123 married women who previously underwent mastectomy and applied to medical oncology clinics of a university hospital. Sexual desire of the women in this study was low, and they were slightly satisfied with sexual life. Consequently, the women required supporting needs of femininity and body image. The result of this study could be utilized to determine sexual desire and satisfaction related to sexual life of women with breast cancer.

AB- This study was designed to examine the relationship between religiousness (organized, non organized, and intrinsic) and religious problem solving (collaborative, deferring, and self-directing) in prostate cancer screening (PCS) attitudes and behavior. Men (N = 481) of African descent between the ages of 40 and 70 participated. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that religiousness and self-directed problem solving were associated with PCS attitudes. Intrinsic religiousness was associated with PCS attitudes after controlling for health and organized religiousness. Religiousness was not associated with PCS behavior. Intrinsic religiousness may be an important dimension of religiousness to be considered in tailoring cancer interventions for individuals from faith-based communities.

AB- This study examined whether different types of coping and social support predict anxiety and depression in 212 hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Data were collected prior to and 6 months after HSCT. Coping, social support, and gender predicted 26% of the variance in pre-HSCT anxiety and 24% of the variance in pre-HSCT depression. Coping and social support did not explain significant post-HSCT anxiety or depression when controlling for pretransplant anxiety or depression. High use of acceptance/resignation coping, cognitive avoidance coping, lower tangible support, and lower belonging support were related to increased pre-HSCT anxiety and depression. Approach coping was not related to pre-HSCT anxiety. Patients who use acceptance/resignation coping and report low levels of two types of social support prior to HSCT may require additional intervention before HSCT, as they are at higher risk for depression and anxiety.

AB- Neuropsychological deficits are among the negative side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. We compared the effects of two types of neuropsychological interventions against a control group with no specific training in a total of 96 female in-patients undergoing oncological rehabilitation. Most results of a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery improved significantly during the patients' oncological rehabilitation in all three groups; we identified no specific intervention effects. We observed little overall correlation between the neuropsychological test results and the patients' own appraisals of their mental capacity. Clinically relevant neuropsychological deficits were still evident 6 months later in a small subgroup of patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The present study used qualitative methods to examine if and how African Americans with cancer use religiosity in coping. Patients (N = 23) were recruited from physician offices and completed 1-1½ hour interviews. Themes that emerged included but were not limited to control over one's illness, emotional response, importance of social support, role of God as a healer, relying on God, importance of faith for recovery, prayer and scripture study, and making sense of the illness. Participants had a great deal to say about the role of religion in coping. These themes may have utility for development of support interventions if they can be operationalized and intervened upon.

SU- Breast Neoplasms; Distress; Human Females; Risk Perception; Social Support
AB- Four dimensions of perceived social support (emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, positive social interaction) were examined as moderators of the effect of perceived breast cancer risk on distress in a cross-sectional sample of 1,366 women recruited from the general population. Heightened perceived breast cancer risk predicted higher levels of depression, but only among women who reported low levels of perceived emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive social interaction support. Tangible and positive social interaction support mitigated the negative effect of heightened risk perception on anxiety. Perceived breast cancer risk was associated with greater cancer worry, regardless of the degree of social support perception. However, this association was weaker for women who perceived greater positive social interaction support. The results suggest that women's perceptions of social support availability can protect them against some of the adverse emotional consequences of heightened breast cancer risk perceptions.

AB- The aim of this study was to investigate the areas of depression, anxiety, and social support using the structural model of the social network. By comparing the networks of two samples of breast cancer sufferers and healthy control participants, it was possible to identify differences in their relationships, in the shape of the networks themselves, and in the levels of depression and anxiety. Women with breast cancer described smaller and denser networks, including mainly kins whereas the healthy women included more friends, coworkers, and leisure companions. The levels of anxiety and depression were higher in women with breast cancer. Social network and social support measure correlated differently with depression and anxiety in the two groups.

AB- As the Association of Oncology Social Work celebrates its 25th year, we pause to reflect on the many historical threads that contributed to its development and hear from each of the presidents who helped create the organization, as we know it today. Set within hospitals, medical social work was born in the early 20th century. In the 1940's medical social work became necessary for hospital accreditation. Two additional historical shifts, one in medical improvements in treating cancer, the other a shift to a consumer-oriented American Cancer Society, contributed to the push for a greater role for the federal government in funding cancer research. Oncology social work came to full blossom in the 1970s, a result of the physicians' need for a member of the health care team who understood cancer, its treatment, and the patient's need to address his or her psychosocial needs resulting from cancer. Today, oncology social work is a fully developed profession with a national organization providing education and support to oncology social workers' in their use of psychosocial interventions and research in behalf of cancer patients and their families.

AB- Studies support the assumption that social connection and support are essential to adequately cope with a life-threatening illness. This exploratory study surveyed a small sample of cancer patients to ask them what they needed at the time of their initial diagnosis and what reactions to their illness that they perceived in others. The ability to clearly identify needs and reactions was deemed as important as the content of their responses. This study supports the premise that when asked cancer patients can identify their own needs and are clearly aware of others’ reactions to their illness.

The obtained consent rate (50%) is much higher than the previously reported rate for men (13%). The reasons for refusal were mainly due to actual barriers (48%) and less frequently due to psychological concerns (10.3%). Most support group participants (71.5%) attended five to six group meetings. The findings suggest that men are willing to attend support groups that focus on solving problems and that social supports help men improve continence and quality of life.

AB- Can attending a communication skills workshop focused on advance care planning, shifting focus to palliative care, personal grief, managing anger, and culture and communication result in changes in attitudes and knowledge? One hundred and three clinicians completed surveys prior to and following the workshop resulting in significant changes in knowledge, attitudes and intent to change that persisted for at least 3 months. As most clinicians are not routinely exposed to learning communication skills for end-of-life conversations, opportunities to practice these skills in a safe supportive environment should be made available in medical schools, residency programs, and in the practice community.

AB- The present study prospectively examined change in diet and physical activity behaviors in 115 women undergoing BRCA1/2 gene testing (46 mutation positive, 46 uninformative and 23 definitive negative). Participants completed measures of diet and physical activity at three time points: prior to genetic testing and 1- and 6-months after receipt of genetic test results. Repeated measures analyses examined between- and within-group differences among participants who received BRCA1/2 positive, uninformative, or definitive negative results. There were no within-group differences across time points or between-group differences at any time point for diet or physical activity. Most participants, overall and within each group, did not meet recommended guidelines for fruit and vegetable and dietary fat consumption. These findings suggest that women do not make spontaneous changes in diet and physical activity following the genetic testing and counseling process. A brief intervention may be necessary for patients who are interested in making changes in modifiable risk factors to complement more definitive risk-reduction strategies.

AB- The identification of positive outcomes from adversity has been commonly termed “benefit finding.” This cross-sectional questionnaire study aimed to identify the extent to which benefit finding occurs among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and what factors are associated. HNC patients treated 6 months to 10 years previously (n = 76), completed the following measures: the LOT-R, HADS, the Brief COPE, and a measure of benefit finding. Moderate to high levels of benefit finding were reported. Optimism and positive reappraisal were positively associated with benefit finding, with optimism acting independently of positive reappraisal coping. These findings have implications for the development of interventions to maximize positive psychological outcomes after treatment.

AB- Ovarian germ cell cancer is a rare tumor. Approximately 1000 to 2000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian germ cell cancer in 2007. When it occurs, it is usually diagnosed before age 20 and is highly responsive to therapy. Most patients live a full life span. The 5-year relative survival rate is 95%. This article describes differences in quality of life issues between ovarian germ cell cancer survivors and young women who have not experienced cancer and were matched to survivors on age, education, and race (by the acquaintance control method). Survivors and controls completed mail and phone surveys. A multivariable logistic regression model was adjusted for age, education, household income, marital status, and perception of fertility. Compared to controls, germ cell cancer survivors expressed more reproductive concerns and reported worse sexual functioning, but they also experienced greater appreciation of life and more affective (i.e., emotional) social support. Future research is suggested to test interventions to enhance quality of life for ovarian germ cell cancer survivors in the areas of sexual functioning and reproductive concerns, but only for survivors who are in distress or in need of the support. Potential screening questions are offered for clinicians, but further research is needed to assess their validity as screening tools.

AB- Recent developments in the treatment of cancer have resulted in an increase in the number of cancer survivors. With this increase in the survival rate comes an increase in questions as to how a diagnosis of cancer and its treatment affects survivors and their well-being. Research has emphasized the impact that medical factors related to cancer have on the well-being of cancer survivors. However, the literature also suggests that socioeconomic factors may affect cancer survivors; well-being. This study focuses on the role that employment status plays in relationship to the levels of psychosocial well-being of women diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer. This study was a cross-sectional design utilizing secondary data analysis. The sample consisted of 369 breast cancer survivors from four cancer treatment facilities in the Mid-Atlantic region. The independent variable was employment status during and after treatment and the dependent variables were psychological distress, physical and mental functioning and quality of life. Utilizing analysis of covariance, controlling for age at diagnosis and stage of cancer it was found that there was a statistically significant difference in the dependent variables by employment status. These findings are discussed in terms of clinical and policy implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study aimed to develop and implement a nurse-led psychoeducational group program for men receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer. These groups are part of a larger multidisciplinary care intervention, which is designed to enhance patient involvement in care. The manual for the groups was developed using a literature review and expert opinion from a multidisciplinary team consisting of radiation oncologists, urology nurses, behavioral scientists, psychologists, radiation therapists, and consumers. The group was pilot tested with 10 participants and further refined based on patient and facilitator feedback. The final program consisted of four, 1-hour, psychoeducational group sessions, with modules covering anatomy, treatment side effects, physical/lifestyle/emotional impacts of prostate cancer, sexuality and communication, and survivorship delivered at pretreatment, midtreatment, end of treatment, and posttreatment. The modular design of this intervention is innovative in that men in the group can collectively nominate which modules they wish to focus on. Feedback from patients and facilitators was positive with minimal changes made to the manual, apart from session 4 that required expansion to permit group members to have greater choice over the content. Participants endorsed the psychoeducational groups as being useful, an appropriate length, and addressing their issues of concern. Further testing of the psychoeducational groups is currently being undertaken as part of a larger randomized controlled trial of the multidisciplinary care intervention.

AB- High-profile events where in response to the experience of breast cancer women take on adventure activities to raise awareness and/or funds for breast cancer are increasing. These activities offer physical and psychological challenges within a peer support group setting. We investigated the experiences of 21 breast cancer survivors who participated in a 7-day breast cancer awareness motorcycle ride. Assessments included a qualitative pre/postinterview, solicited diary, pre-6-month follow-up survey. Measures included satisfaction with life, distress, happiness, global well being, meaning in life. Motivators were a desire for peer support, to promote breast cancer awareness, enjoyment, and personal growth. The ride incorporated physical and emotional challenge. A positive peer support experience led to feelings of inner peace, accomplishment, self-learning, a positive perspective, and improved social support. For a minority of women peer support or recreational expectations were not met resulting in negative feelings. No significant changes were observed over time in adjustment measures. Adventure events where women undertake emotional and physical challenge in an environment of group peer support provide opportunity for personal growth. In this context, peer support may provide the catalyst for the experience to become transformational and so is critical to generating positive outcomes. Realistic expectations of the ride are also influential. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study reports findings from 21 in-depth interviews with oncology clinicians (social workers, physicians, and nurses). Interviews addressed clinicians’ overall experiences of their work, including professional roles, teamwork, challenges and rewards of the work, and thoughts about whether oncology work changed their worldview. Researchers used an expedition metaphor to understand oncology clinicians’ experiences. An expedition and oncology work have in common a clear division of labor, the necessity of collaboration, intense work, significant obstacles, great rewards, and work that the world at large cannot tolerate undertaking. Understanding the experiences of oncology health professionals is essential in attracting and retaining dedicated clinicians and in helping them mitigate the potential deleterious effects of their work, such as compassion fatigue. Additionally, the expedition metaphor itself is compelling; it highlights the breadth of experiences of oncology clinicians, particularly that successful multidisciplinary teamwork in itself can ameliorate compassion fatigue.

AB- African Americans are disproportionately burdened with colorectal cancer. Although incidence and mortality rates have declined in the past two decades, the disparity in health outcomes has progressively increased. This comprehensive review examines the existing literature regarding racial disparities in colorectal cancer screening, stage at diagnosis, and treatment to determine if differences exist in the quality of care delivered to African Americans. A comprehensive review of relevant literature was performed. Two databases (EBSCOHOST Academic Search Premier and Scopus) were searched from 2000 to 2007. Articles that assessed racial disparities in colorectal cancer screening, stage of disease at diagnosis, and treatment were selected. The majority of studies identified examined colorectal cancer screening outcomes. Although racial disparities in screening have diminished in recent years, African American men and women continue to have higher colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates and are diagnosed at more advanced stages. Several studies regarding stage of disease at diagnosis identified socioeconomic status (SES) and health insurance status as major determinants of disparity. However, some studies found significant racial disparities even after controlling for these factors. Racial disparities in treatment were also found at various diagnostic stages. Many factors affecting disparities between African Americans and Whites in colorectal cancer incidence and mortality remain unexplained. Although the importance of tumor biology, genetics, and lifestyle risk factors have been established, prime sociodemographic factors need further examination to understand variances in the care of African Americans diagnosed with colorectal cancer.

AB- Previous studies suggest that support from social networks is a protective factor buffering the negative effects of stressful events, such as having a child with a chronic illness. The literature highlights the need for more systematic examination of parents’ social support networks across the disease trajectory, to obtain a more complete understanding of how a family’s support system affects adjustment over time. This was attempted in this study of 88 parents of children with brain tumors, recruited from hospitals in Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand. It employed a longitudinal design, tracking families for 2 years postdiagnosis to examine the relationship between social support and coping. As in previous research this study showed that different types of support are needed at different stages in the illness trajectory. The study also identified the use of various coping strategies by families, directed at the maintenance and enhancement of existing supports and the securing of new supports. The study failed to establish a statistically significant relationship between level of coping and social support, however, suggesting that parents were using primarily "internal" familial modes of coping, including preexisting patterns of coping, with external social support being an adjunct to their coping rather than being a major contributor.

AB- This qualitative investigation aims to identify the salient support concerns of young women with BRCA mutations, a frequently understudied population with unique developmental, psychosocial, and family needs. Twenty-three unaffected BRCA gene alteration carriers aged 21 to 36 completed illness genograms and open-ended interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using the Listening Guide to highlight key themes, relationships, and meaning structures. Results reveal existing social support networks composed of family, partners, friends, and coworkers are often inadequate and formal services unavailable or underutilized. These findings suggest an important role for clinicians in reducing isolation, bolstering existing support networks, and designing innovative, targeted interventions that address the challenges specific to this age group. Interventions, such as the multifamily support group, should be integrated into genetic counseling protocols to mitigate the risk of distress.

Participants completed measures of PTG, spirituality, optimism, stage of cancer, and demographics variables. The results showed that women with cervical cancer reported PTG but at lower levels than in studies of women with breast cancer. Greater spirituality and more advanced cancer stage predicted more PTG, but optimism did not predict PTG. HISP women reported higher levels of PTG than NHW women, and greater spirituality in the HISP women partially accounted for the difference.

AB- The purpose of the study was to determine whether sense of coherence (SOC), and demographic variables (age, gender, race, education, length of illness) predict quality of life (QOL) in cancer inpatients. SOC is the extent to which one finds life comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. Participants were 49 inpatients (66% female) with various forms of cancer, mostly African American (71%), with a mean age of 54.5 years. The mean QOLS of cancer inpatients (84.6)was lower than a healthy population (90.0), however, their mean item scores indicated that they are “mostly satisfied” with most areas of QOL except for active forms of past-time and health. The mean SOC score (133.8) was also lower than other groups; however without appropriate norms, it cannot be concluded that cancer inpatients have a weak SOC. Multiple regressions showed that SOC was a significant predictor of QOL, and that the demographic variables were not predictive of QOL, except when combined with SOC. All findings may be limited by demographics of the sample (race, gender, age, severity of illness), and the inability of cross-sectional investigations to determine causality.

AB- One result of the widespread screening mammography is a 200% increase in the rates of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Treatment decision making among Chinese women diagnosed with DCIS remains understudied. This study examined Chinese-Canadian women’s experiences (N = 26): (1) with treatment decision making (mastectomy or breast conserving surgery) and (2) their reflections on the decision-making process. Interviews in Cantonese, Mandarin, or English were transcribed and translated, and a content analysis conducted. Women’s treatment decisions reflected a lack of understanding of DCIS, the desire to rid themselves of breast cancer “forever,” and the influence of significant others. English as a second language and use of medical jargon impeded their ability to make informed treatment decisions. Women’s reflections on the decision-making process provided insights into how to improve information and support treatment decision making in ways that are accessible to them.

AB- For newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, BRCA1/2 genetic counseling (GC) and/or testing has the greatest potential to affect treatment choices if it occurs prior to definitive surgery. This qualitative study sought to examine recently diagnosed breast cancer patients’ experiences with pretest GC (n = 9). Study results show the primary reason most women attended GC was due to a family history of cancer. Most women expressed high levels of satisfaction with timing of GC regardless of whether they were referred prior to or after definitive surgical treatment. In this study, newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, particularly those who have already completed definitive surgery, may not be fully informed about the purpose and implications of BRCA1/2 GC and/or testing for treatment decisions had they been referred prior to definitive surgery for their breast cancer diagnosis. Thus, many women felt the information provided during GC had little utility with respect to their current breast cancer diagnosis.

AB- Few studies have investigated the influence of optimism–pessimism in breast cancer survivors. This study used a retrospective design with 268 adult women who completed the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) as part of their medical care approximately 10 years prior to their breast cancer diagnosis and Medical Outcome Study Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36 or SF-12), on average, 8 years after diagnosis. MMPI pessimism scores were divided into quartiles, and t tests were used to determine differences between those highest and lowest in pessimism on health-related quality-of-life (QOL)measures, demographics, and disease status. The mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 63 years, and 74% had early-stage breast cancer. Patients age 65 years and older were significantly lower on physical health–related QOL scales. There were no significant differences in health-related QOL scores by stage of disease. Patients with a pessimistic explanatory style were significantly lower on all of the health-related QOL scores, compared to those with a non pessimistic style. Breast cancer survivors who exhibit a pessimistic explanatory style report lower health-related QOL for years after receiving a cancer diagnosis, compared to non pessimistic women.

AB- This study sought to confirm the literature reports on psychological well-being during radiotherapy treatment using a population across multiple clinical sites, resulting in a larger population (N = 156) than has typically been followed in quality of life descriptive studies of radiotherapy, and a more varied one in terms of diagnosis. This study is unique in its individual differences perspective, whereby it aimed to identify those demographic variables that predict baseline levels of psychological distress as well as changes in distress during treatment. The data used were the control data from a previous study assessing the effectiveness of a stress management intervention. Participants completed the SF-36, STAI-S, and CES-D scales at baseline and after Weeks 1, 2, and 3 of treatment. Consistent with prior studies, this study found that, on average, patients began with a low level of psychological distress, as indicated by the scale norms. However, this study found considerable variation in anxiety levels, with some patients beginning treatment with a relatively high level of anxiety. For those with relatively high levels of baseline anxiety, anxiety decreased during treatment. A patient’s baseline psychological distress level was predicted by marital status, diagnosis, gender, education level, and income range. In addition, cancer type, income level, and education level predicted changes in distress levels over treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Parental cancer during young adulthood is unexpected and potentially disruptive to the developmental goals of this period. This study explores how young adult women experience a parent's cancer diagnosis and treatment. The sample included five participants, aged 20 to 32, who had a parent receiving cancer treatment. The interactive interview format, derived from an autoethnographic approach, allowed the first author (J. P.) to include her own experiences of her mother's cancer in the data. Analysis of the transcribed interviews revealed a number of themes including time, hope and spirituality, the meaning of cancer, relationships, family and coping. Time, an overriding theme in the interviews, is the focus of this article. Sub-themes under time include (1) unexpected timing, (2) uncertainty/waiting, (3) being present, (4) concerns for future, (5) acceleration of time, (6) illness progression and (7) holidays. This research revealed that a daughter's perception of time was altered by her parent's illness, and it also highlighted the significance of parental illness during young adulthood. Practitioners working with this population should be aware of issues related to timing so that daughters can be supported in coping with their parents' illnesses, and in achieving the developmental goals of this transitional phase of the life course.

Participants included 128 male patients diagnosed with 138 primary cancers ranging in age from 23 to 79 years of age. Men in this study expressed interest in attending an informational intervention and provided several topics that they would like to learn about, including nutrition, sexual functioning, stress management, and spirituality. Implications for the development of a male-specific clinical intervention are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Participants were randomly selected and asked to complete a questionnaire about CRC screening. After controlling for gender, age, education, income, health insurance, and family history of CRC, differences in screening rates as a function of ethnicity remained. Physicians' recommendations and perceived efficacy of screening were also strong predictors of CRC screening. Psychological factors accounted in part for differences in screening rates between European Americans and Mexican Americans.

AB- National studies on suicide ideation in cancer patients are small in size, including only patients from select medical centers. Our purpose was to determine correlates of suicide ideation in a population-based sample of cancer patients. Data from the sixth National Mortality Followback Survey were analyzed using SAS and SUDAAN for 980 individuals with cancer present at time of death. Multiple logistic regression analyses included sociodemographics, health-related factors, and social support variables. Prevalence of suicide ideation was 17.7%. Suicidality was significantly more likely in cancer patients who were previously married, had a history of mental illness, died of lung, respiratory or oral cancer, had one or more chronic diseases and used multiple prescription drugs in the past year. Suicide ideation in cancer patients is not solely a manifestation of depression. Overall poor physical health influences patients' desires for hastened death.

AB- The objective of this study was to investigate self- and maternal ratings of Quality of Life (QoL) of children with cancer undergoing treatment and to examine the association with personality traits. Thirty-seven children with cancer and their mothers completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ version 4.0 (PedsQL), and the mothers also filled in the Hierarchical Personality Inventory for Children (HiPIC). Fifty-four healthy individuals served as a comparison group. Children with cancer and their mothers reported significantly poorer QoL, and the correspondence between mother and child for QoL was higher in the ill sample. QoL and personality measures shared substantial variance, suggesting that personality significantly affects children's QoL beyond effects from experiencing a negative life event such as cancer and its treatment.

AB- This investigation evaluated the psychological needs of men (n = 28) with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. A mixed qualitative-quantitative approach was employed. The qualitative component consisted of focus groups and the quantitative component included administration of standardized measures assessing quality of life (QOL), anxiety, and mood. Participants reported substantial anxiety and other negative moods secondary to prostate cancer. Responses from the quantitative instruments suggest participants experience significant health problems specific to prostate cancer, while their general QOL is superior to other chronically ill medical populations. In contrast to the qualitative data, participants rated their mood as favorable on the quantitative measures. Data were used to guide development of a novel QOL intervention.

AB- To examine the various concerns of patients after being diagnosed with cancer as well as the availability of information to address concerns from the time of diagnosis to the completion of treatment, we analyzed data from a longitudinal study of 731 adults recently diagnosed with cancer. Concerns about the effectiveness and side effects of treatment and family stress were most common after diagnosis. Information about the diagnosis and treatment plan was readily available to patients, but information addressing social, lifestyle, and financial concerns was less available. Significantly more information was desired regarding the long-term implications of treatment and disease. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The current study examined whether adult children of recently diagnosed breast cancer patients experience heightened general and major stressor-related distress, and identified a potential mediator between these two forms of distress. Unique from other stress studies, the current study proposed a novel intrapsychic construct, the extent to which one understands and recognizes his or her thoughts and feelings related to a major stressor, for which we coined the term cognitive and emotional coherence. Albeit preliminary, findings supported study hypotheses and argue that this construct may represent an important mediator of distress as well as a pivotal target for psychosocial intervention.

AB- The current study examines the relationship between a woman’s perception of her partner’s emotional, behavioral, and intimate adaptation to her breast cancer and her levels of distress, wellbeing, and social support. Sixty-six women diagnosed with Stage I or II breast cancer within the previous year completed distress, wellbeing and social support measures and answered open-ended questions describing their partners’ adaptation to their cancer. Women whose partners’ intimate adaptation is positive had significantly lower distress, and positive emotional and intimate adaptation was related to higher well-being and social support. These results suggest that efforts to address women’s psychosocial needs during their initial treatment of breast cancer should include a focus on their relationships and, possibly, interventions aimed at assisting the adjustment of their spouse or significant other.

AB- This article describes results from a qualitative study that explored the role and function of legacy in the lives of women cancer survivors. Legacy emerged as the passing on of values and beliefs. The results were derived from information gathered from in-depth interviews with 14 women aged 31-81 years, diagnosed with cancer. The interviews collected information related to what the women wanted their legacy to be, and how and to whom they hope to transmit it. Analysis of the interviews was guided by a typology of three distinct but overlapping categories of legacy: Legacy of Belongings, Legacy of Body, and a Legacy of Being (Hunter & Rowles, 2005). One recurring theme from the interviews was the hope that family members would learn from the experiences of the participants and would adopt positive health behaviors and cancer screening. The findings suggest that addressing legacy interests and opportunities may be an important tool for addressing needs of cancer survivors.

Supportive responses included practical assistance, as well as people's willingness to listen, maintain a positive attitude, and pray. Unsupportive responses included others' withdrawal behaviors, patients having to support friends/family as they coped, and family/friends limiting patients' independence. Results reflect ways in which mental health providers, social workers, and health care providers can help patients express support needs, as well as how social networks can be better educated about the types of support valued by patients.

AB- Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in men and women. Lung cancer accounts for approximately 30% of all cancer deaths in the United States. In addition, it is the most often diagnosed cancer in men, and the second most often diagnosed cancer in women. Five-year survival rates in lung cancer remain very low, around 15%. Approximately 45% of patients present with stage III disease. The majority of these patients are considered non-resectable, leading to the poor survival statistics seen in this disease. Unfortunately, survival rates have not improved in the past 30 years despite much research in diagnostics and therapeutics. Patients with advanced disease often experience multiple symptoms, including fatigue, pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and anorexia. This paper will review the enormous toll that lung cancer takes on society, as well as individuals and families affected. In addition, we will examine psychosocial factors pertinent to lung cancer. Specifically, the article briefly discusses treatment approaches to lung cancer, as they relate to quality of life (QOL). QOL as a construct within lung cancer is then reviewed. Comment is made on the evaluation and prognostic importance of QOL. Next, economic and survivorship aspects of lung cancer are discussed. Finally, a summary of relevant psychosocial interventions for patients diagnosed with lung cancer is given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The means used by cancer patients to cope with each of three death anxieties (i.e., fear of pain and suffering, loneliness, and the unknown) that contribute to their psychological distress have rarely been examined. Differences between cancer patients with Stage I or II disease (Group 1) and Stage III or IV disease (Group 2) were explored. T-tests revealed no difference between the groups. Age-controlled Pearson correlations were used to determine the relationship between all three death anxieties, and some recognized coping devices used by cancer patients, namely, coping styles, optimism, and religiosity/spirituality. Results showed that, for Group 1, avoidant coping correlated positively with fear of the unknown, and social diversion correlated positively with fear of pain and suffering. As for similarities between groups, with the exception of fear of pain and suffering for Group 2, emotion-focused coping correlated positively with all three death anxieties, and optimism correlated negatively with fear of the unknown. The advantage for researchers and clinicians of including measures or evaluation of the death anxieties in their considerations of the psychological distress of cancer patients is discussed.

AB- Introduction: Recent literature has suggested that follow-up visits provide psychological support for patients with cancer, but largely without objective evidence. Aims: To examine the psychological impact of follow-up consultations on cancer patients and identify factors that influence patient anxiety. Methods: Patients attending a routine follow-up at Liverpool Cancer Therapy Centre were surveyed. Using the State & Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), anxiety scores were obtained before and after consultation. Results: Two hundred and thirty-one patients participated, 199 patients were treated with curative intent, 62% were male. The mean anxiety score was higher in females and in palliative cases. Lower levels of social support, poor perception of own health and receiving bad news during consultation were associated with higher STAI scores. Satisfaction with cancer treatment was associated with lower STAI scores. There was a small but statistically significant reduction of anxiety scores after consultation (p = 0.02). Conclusions: When measured objectively, specialist consultation appears to have a small, but statistically significant, positive impact on the level of patient anxiety. Patient satisfaction correlated well with the patient anxiety levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Objectives: To examine depressive symptoms in children treated for a brain tumor and related clinical, demographic and personal factors. Methods: Fifty-four children with brain tumors (32 males) aged 8.2-18.3 years participated. Standardized measures assessed depressive symptoms, social skills, self-worth and IQ. Clinical (treatment) and demographic variables (gender) were also examined. Results: Depression scores were subjected to a 2 (gender), X 2 (social skills: low, high), X 3 (self-worth: low, average, high) ANCOVA with IQ as the covariate. Significant main effects of gender and of self-worth and an interaction between gender, social skills, and self-worth were observed. Gender was identified as a moderator of the effect of social skills and self-worth on depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Gender, social skills, and self-worth play important roles in the depressive symptoms of pediatric brain tumor patients.

AB- Background: Patients with advanced cancer face multiple challenges to their quality of life (QOL). The goal of this study was to including a social service component, on improving the QOL of patients with advanced cancer undergoing radiation therapy. Design: A total of 115 participants with newly diagnosed advanced stage cancer, who were receiving radiation therapy, were randomly assigned to either participate in an 8-session structured multidisciplinary intervention or to receive standard care. Each 90-minute session was led by either a psychologist or psychiatrist and co-led with a nurse, physical therapist, chaplain, and/or social worker. The sessions were designed to address the domains that impact QOL: emotional, spiritual, physical, and social domains (support, community resources, financial and legal issues, and advance directives). QOL was assessed, at baseline, 4 (end of treatment), 8 and 27 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall QOL assessed on a 0-100 scale at Week 4. Results: A total of 115 patients were enrolled from October 2, 2000 to October 28, 2002. Overall QOL at Week 4 averaged 10 points higher in the intervention group than in the control group (80 vs. 70 points, p = 0.047) which was an increase of 3% from baseline in the intervention group versus a decrease of 9% in the control group (p = 0.009). Of the subscores reflecting patient's opinion regarding their QOL, there was improvement in all social domains which contributed to the overall improvement in QOL. Significant changes from baseline to Week 4 scores were seen in the areas of financial concerns (p = 0.025) and legal issues (p = 0.048). Conclusions: A social work component within a structured multidisciplinary intervention results in significant advantages in the social domain of QOL, and contributes to clinically meaningful improvements in the overall QOL for patients with advanced cancer undergoing active medical treatment. Numerous studies have documented the financial burdens and social changes that may occur with the diagnosis of cancer. However, previous research has not examined the role of a social worker in providing financial, social, and legal education, in a structured multidisciplinary intervention, and its direct impact on QOL. Outlined in this paper is the role of the medical social worker in a clinical trial, how education was provided and strategies for future interventions.

AB- Cancer patients and their partners experience elevated distress and unmet supportive care needs at the time of treatment, however, their ongoing needs have not been adequately described. This qualitative study explores the needs of disease-free cancer survivors and their partners using semi-structured telephone interviews. A convenience sample of 25 key informants' identified needs in the domains of information, health care, physical functioning, relationships, emotions, socio-economic issues, expectations and life perspective; and the positive outcomes are widely reported. The identification of unique needs of survivors and partners supports the development of supportive care measures to specifically assess ongoing care needs in these populations.

AB- The influence of life stage on psychosocial adjustment and on factors related to this adjustment were examined in post-operative colorectal cancer patients without stoma. PAIS-SR (Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale-Self-Report) was used to assess psychosocial adjustment, and patients were divided into two groups; a senior group (age &gt; 65 years, n = 34) and a non-senior group (age &lt; 65 years, n = 59) based on cultural features in Japan. Results were compared between two groups for each of the following PAIS domains: "vocational environment," "domestic environment," "sexual relationship," "extended family environment," "social environment," and "psychological distress." Psychosocial adjustment was found to differ by life stage only for "psychological distress" (non-senior vs. senior: 48.6 ± 9.4 vs. 44.7 ± 7.7, p &lt; .05). However, analysis of background factors related to psychosocial adjustment revealed distinct patterns in each life stage. This study suggests that life stage should be considered when attempts are made to improve the psychosocial adjustment among cancer patients.

AB- Sexuality is an important aspect of life and is often affected in patients diagnosed with cancer. For women, estimates of sexual dysfunction range from 40 to 100%. In light of these statistics, we were interested in determining the comfort level and practice of specialists in gynecologic oncology as it relates to taking a sexual history and addressing related concerns by conducting a survey of the New England Association of Gynecologic Oncologists (NEAGO). Our results show that although nearly all respondents felt comfortable addressing sexual problems in their patients, less than half took a sexual history in new patients and 80% did not feel there was sufficient time to devote to exploring sexual issues. The results of our survey suggest that aspects of sexual dysfunction in women with gynecologic cancer may be neglected by gynecologic oncology providers. This encourages cancer programs to develop formal resources for women with questions regarding sexuality following a diagnosis of cancer.

AB- The aim of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of experiential-existential group psychotherapy with a social support group for women with a primary breast cancer on psychosocial adjustment. A total of 67 well-adjusted women, who had been operated not earlier than 4 months before start of the study, were randomized into one of the two conditions: participating in the group psychotherapy or in the support group. They were questioned at the start of the study, at the end of the intervention, and 1 year after completion of the intervention. Results at follow-up were mixed: Positive changes were reported for Body Image and Recreation, regardless of type of intervention. Other psychosocial adjustment indicators did not change. In general, we may conclude that well-adjusted women diagnosed with breast cancer do not specifically benefit from these types of interventions.

Using semi-structured interviews, this study compared 18 White and 16 Latina women's understanding of their DCIS diagnosis, treatment decision-making processes, and satisfaction with care. Ethnic differences were observed in cognitive and emotional responses to DCIS, with White women generally reporting a better understanding of their diagnosis and treatment, and Latinas reporting more distress. Regardless of ethnicity, women with DCIS preferred that physicians discuss treatment options and attend to their informational and emotional needs. Satisfaction was associated with adequate information, expediency of care, and physicians' sensitivity to patients' emotional needs.

AB- Considerable effort has been devoted to the identification of cost-effective approaches to screening for ovarian cancer (OC). Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is one such screening approach. Approximately 5-7% of routine TVS screening tests yield abnormal results. Some women experience significant distress after receipt of an abnormal TVS screening test. Four focus groups provided in-depth, qualitative data regarding the informational, psychological, and practical needs of women after the receipt of an abnormal TVS result. Through question and content analytic procedures, we identified four themes: anticipation, emotional response, role of the screening technician, and impact of prior cancer experiences. Results provide initial guidance toward development of interventions to promote adaptive responses after receipt of an abnormal cancer screening test result.

AB- In previous studies, the report of distress has been documented in parents after successfully completing cancer treatment of a child. It is typically assumed that this distress represents lasting reactions to experiences during active treatment, in the form of post-traumatic stress or less severe crisis reactions. However, some researchers have suggested that parents may also perceive current stressors related to a child's cancer even after successful completion of the cancer treatment. Using two family cases as a framework, we discuss strain and new conditions requiring adaptation in various aspects of the everyday life of parents after treatment completion. In addition, we argue that an examination of psychological exhaustion and fatigue in these parents may be appropriate. Further examination is needed on the nature of parental stress after a child's cancer treatment. The distinction is important, since the appropriate methods for professional support may differ with regard to parents struggling to cope with current stressors and those showing signs of persistent post-traumatic stress or fatigue.

AB- For young people with cancer their process through adolescence is marked with disruption. The demands of treatment and resulting social isolation combined with issues of body image/self-esteem complicate this turbulent life cycle transition. The effects of these disruptions require psychosocial staff to utilize creative approaches to treatment. The framework of the Teen Outreach Program (TOP) is to connect teens with leukemia/lymphoma to one another, and to reconnect them back with their peers by engaging them in "normal" events. The overwhelming response highlights the positive effect on teenagers' psychosocial health, thereby solidifying the importance of providing innovative therapeutic interventions for this under-serviced population. Further studies of the long-term impact of the program's success are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Ovarian cancer is the fourth highest cause of cancer deaths in the US. Psychosocial issues may be prevalent among these women. This study examined the efficacy of a gynecological cancer resource program. Fifty-three women completed questionnaires over a year's time. The women felt positively about the program, and used several of the services. The most used services were that of the center coordinator/nurse practitioner, the GYN support group, the hair consultant, and the imagery sessions. The social worker, massage therapist, and the nutritionist seemed to be important at the beginning of the cancer experience but not so much at later stages. Having a nurse practitioner who could talk about treatment side effects, menopause, body image, sexuality, etc., was helpful to at least half of the women. Psychological distress decreased over time, as did quality of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

A second aim was to examine the association between symptoms and cancer-related stress and coping. A total of 103 Greek breast cancer survivors, who had undergone a mastectomy more than 3 years ago and were free of any metastasis or relapse, participated in the study. The comparison group consisted of 100 women matched for age, education and marital status. Survivors scored significantly higher only in depressive symptomatology. Cancer-related stress and certain coping strategies were associated with psychological symptoms, even after controlling for demographic variables and time since mastectomy. Stress and focusing on the positive played a significant role in predicting depressive symptomatology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

A total of 353 Dutch cancer survivors, aged 18-30, completed the RAND-36 Health Survey and the Course-of- Life questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed. Survivors of brain tumors and survivors having been treated with radiotherapy reported the achievement of significantly fewer milestones in the psychosexual and social domain than the other survivors. Survivors who achieved fewer milestones in the social domain scored worse on QoL. Health-care providers should help to minimize the harm for children who grow up with cancer by encouraging social and psychosexual development. Children should be encouraged to make friends and to participate in peer activities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Background: A plethora of research now exists documenting the benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients; however, no studies have been conducted with people diagnosed with hepatobiliary carcinoma. Methods: A total of 28 patients agreed to participate in the study in which 14 patients were randomized to the intervention arm of the study and 14 patients to an attention-standard of care arm. Evaluation of the benefits of the intervention was performed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep), the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) to assess anxiety, peripheral blood leukocytes to measure immune system modulation, and survival. Results: Results indicate that patients who were randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the study reported clinically, but not statistically, significant improvements on symptoms of depression and anxiety, disease- related symptoms and treatment side effects, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and modest improvements in peripheral blood leukocytes and survival when compared with the standard of care group. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the individually tailored intervention was feasible and preliminary data suggested that the intervention may improve patients' HRQL, mood, and had modest improvements in immune system functioning and survival. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to test the statistical significance and generalizability of the individually tailored intervention.

AB- Objectives: This paper evaluates the association between psychological problems and cancer workup in children aged less than 20 and their parents. Assessment of the potential psychological stress in these children and their parents has been inadequately studied in the past. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of anxiety or depression among children and the parents of children undergoing cancer workup, based on Deseret Mutual Benefit Administrators (DMBA) claims data and cor- responding enrollment files for dependent children aged less than 20, from 1998 to 2002 in the United States and Canada. Results: Less than 20% of cancer workups are followed by cancer diagnosis and treatment. Children with a "cancer workup only" are 89% more likely to experience anxiety/depression than are children without a cancer-related claim; that is, the rate per 100,000 person-years of anxiety/depression is 7,222 for children with a cancer workup only compared with 3,824 for children without a cancer-related claim. Mothers of children with cancer workup are 37% more likely to experience anxiety/depression. Children are significantly more likely to experience anxiety/depression if one or both of their parents experience anxiety/depression. The increased risk is influenced by whether the child experiences both cancer workup and treatment (359% higher), by cancer workup only (308% higher), and by no cancer workup or treatment (295% higher). Finally, the rate of anxiety/depression among children with cancer workup and their mothers was significantly lower in homes with more children. Conclusions: A cancer workup alone is sufficient to significantly increase the risk of anxiety/depression in children undergoing cancer workup and in their parents. The ability of a child undergoing a cancer workup to cope is influenced by the mental health of their parents. More children in the home are protective against anxiety/depression in children undergoing cancer workup and in their mothers.

AB- This retrospective pilot study examined the relationship between psychological status at the time of breast cancer diagnosis and ratings of cosmetic outcome later. Sixty-three patients completed measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of life at the time of diagnosis. Following lumpectomy and radiation therapy, these patients and their radiation oncologists completed ratings of the quality of the cosmetic outcome (Cosmesis). The results indicated that both psychological distress and quality of life were related to patients' ratings of Cosmesis, while only patients' quality of life was related to physicians' ratings of Cosmesis. We conclude that Cosmesis is a multifaceted construct that incorporates both physical and psychological factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study examines psychosocial difficulties faced by Chinese patients with colorectal cancer, and attempts to identify factors that contribute to the meaning searching process that in turn brings about growth and transformation. Twenty-six patients with colorectal cancer were interviewed. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Two domains of psychosocial disorientation states were identified, namely, cognitive disorientation and emotional disorientation. Factors that facilitate meaning searching were identified and categorized into personal factors and external factors. The areas of growth and transformation through meaning searching were presented with narratives. Findings from the present study not only shed light on psychosocial hindrances among colorectal cancer patients but also have the potential to inform the design of intervention strategies to bring about meaning-orientated transformation through cancer experiences.

AB- The present survey study examines whether satisfaction with health care predicts breast cancer patients' psychological adjustment and esteem for their communities. Forty-nine women undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer completed measures of satisfaction with health care, psychological well-being, community esteem, depression, perceived health status, and demographics. As predicted, the results showed that breast cancer survivors' satisfaction with their health care was predictive of their psychological well-being even when controlling for relevant variables such as depression and health status. Also, breast cancer survivors' satisfaction with their health care predicted their level of community esteem. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the psychological adjustment of breast cancer survivors.

AB- We examined the links between coping and psychological outcomes in 53 patients who had undergone radiotherapy for cancer. Patients completed a coping survey and a measure of perceived support during a six-week course of radiation therapy and reported about their mental health and marital satisfaction one month following treatment. The prospective associations between coping and psychological distress and martial satisfaction depended upon the supportive context in which patients were coping. Seeking emotional support and using positive reappraisal were more effective (i.e., were significantly and positively correlated with marital satisfaction) for people low in spousal support than for people high in such support. Although men and women reported coping similarly with the cancer and had similar levels of adjustment, the association between coping and outcomes differed by gender; the associations for women were significantly stronger than they were for men. Results thus suggest that both individual and environmental characteristics moderate the associations between coping and outcomes in cancer survivors.

AB- The Satisfaction with Life Domains Scale for Cancer (SLDS-C) is a brief self-report measure of quality of life that uses a familiar and easily understood graphic response format of smiling and frowning faces. This article explores the factor structure and further examines the validity of the SLDS-C compared with another cancer-specific quality-of-life measure, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale-General (FACT-G), in a sample of patients with a variety of cancer diagnoses. A self-administered questionnaire containing the SLDS-C and the FACT-G was completed by 352 adult cancer survivors who were at various points post diagnosis. Three SLDS-C factor subscales were derived from analyses of these data: "Life as a Whole," "Daily Activities," and "Social Relationships." Evidence for the concurrent validity of the SLDS-C is presented, including its correlation with the total score of the FACT-G (r = .76) and its correlation with subscale scores of this widely used cancer quality-of-life measure. The SLDS-C has a high level of internal consistency (α = .94), and differences in SLDS-C total scores were found for time since diagnosis, number of diagnoses, spread of disease, type of cancer, and treatment status.

AB- Clinical depression is the most common psychiatric disorder among cancer patients and is associated with significant functional impairment. Unfortunately, depression in cancer patients is often under-diagnosed and untreated, and studies examining the predictive utility of assessment instruments in detecting clinically depressed cancer patients are sparse. Using a structured interview, thirty-three patients with various cancer types were diagnosed as having major depression (n = 24) or no psychiatric diagnosis (n = 9). All patients were administered the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the Center for Epidemiological Studies in Depression Scale (CES-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI), a medical and psychosocial functioning questionnaire (SF-36), and given co-morbidity of depression with anxiety disorders, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Depressed and non-depressed cancer patients were compared and contrasted across all assessment measures and accuracy of instruments was based on evaluating their sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values. Depressed cancer patients exhibited more severe depressive symptoms and poorer quality of life, increased anxiety and bodily pain, and decreased vitality and social functioning. All instruments exhibited strong predictive properties, with the CES-D and BDI-II considered most feasible given their time efficiency, administrative simplicity, and strong psychometric properties.

AB- Sexual quality of life (QOL) is a significant concern for breast cancer survivors. This study investigated sexual quality of life in a sample of 191 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. Sixty percent of the sample indicated disruption in their sexual quality of life. Sexual QOL during treatment was significantly more disrupted among women who received chemotherapy, were younger, had higher stage of disease, reported more depressive symptoms near time of diagnosis, and underwent a total mastectomy. Hierarchical linear regression was used to model sexual QOL and feelings of sexual attractiveness. Worse physical quality of life, chemotherapy, and depressive symptoms near time of diagnosis were associated with worse sexual QOL during treatment. An interaction between chemotherapy status and type of surgery, for feelings of sexual attractiveness, suggested that chemotherapy affected sexual attractiveness only among women who underwent a lumpectomy. These results add to growing evidence that sexual QOL is a multidimensional construct with aspects differentially affected by variables related to cancer survivorship.

AB- The dual challenge of normal adolescent development combined with a diagnosis places high demands on the coping of adolescents with cancer (AWC). A review was conducted to synthesize and critique studies of coping in AWC. Findings from this review indicated inconsistent results for developmental and gender differences as well as associations of coping with distress. A number of limitations were associated with these studies, including the use of small samples, lack of consistency in the conceptualization of coping and instruments, and limited knowledge helpful to inform intervention research to improve effective coping in AWC. Future studies are needed to address these limitations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Studies have reported that race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, access to care, early diagnosis, quality of care, and spirituality are important prognostic factors for a breast cancer diagnosis. This exploratory study seeks to identify the perceived needs of Black middle-income breast cancer survivors. The Delphi Technique, a qualitative research approach (for deriving cultural consensus), was used to assess needs of 62 Black middle-income socioeconomic position survivors. Survivors' expressed needs were to have (1) affordable, accessible, acceptable, and appropriate medical and support services; (2) a caring and loving family; (3) contacts for information regarding breast cancer symptoms or related health problems; (4) an intimate relationship with God; and (5) adequate resources for self and family care. This pilot study suggests Black breast cancer survivors, regardless of a middle-income socioeconomic position (SEP), experience similar socioecological stressors as low-income SEP survivors.

AB- Latinas experience high rates of cervical cancer (CCA) in the U.S. This health-related quality of life (HRQOL) qualitative study was conducted with key informant and focus groups (N = 26). The results indicate that overall Latinas experience persistent concerns: Physical challenges including pain, and bladder, bowel, and sexual health problems; medical care barriers (e.g., difficulties accessing quality care, poor patient-physician relationship); functional issues including employment difficulties; and personal concerns including family and relationship burdens. Spiritual, familial, and cultural factors promote coping and well-being but may delay care seeking. In summary, Latinas diagnosed with CCA face a burdensome survivorship experience. Increases in medical and psychosocial services are greatly needed for Latinas to improve cancer outcomes including HRQOL.

AB- Oral cancer affects approximately 5% of the Canadian population every year. One option for treatment of oropharyngeal cancer includes resection of the diseased tissue with primary reconstruction of the defect using a microvascular free flap, followed by post-operative adjuvant radiation therapy. The aim of reconstructive surgery is to maintain functional speech and swallowing. While the literature provides support for the maintenance of speech intelligibility following reconstructive procedures, certain aspects of resonance may be altered when the palatal structures are involved. Little is known about the effect of such alterations on the perception of speakers who have been treated with microvascular free flap reconstruction. Social perception is a process in which we infer attributes of others, with the speech signal playing an integral part in attribution. The purpose of this study was to explore the social perceptions formed about speakers both before and after surgery for oropharyngeal cancer. The results of this study revealed that positive perceptions of speakers significantly diminished as a result of surgery and negative perceptions increased. Certain variables, such as degree of resection of the soft palate and base of tongue, and sex of the speaker, had influence on the results. This research suggests that intelligibility measurements of speech, although useful, do not provide a complete indication of the social impact of reconstructive surgery on patients with oropharyngeal resections.

AB- Cancer patients experience enormous psychological stress in addition to their physical suffering. Neither disease- nor symptom-specific approaches in the conventional Western medical model or single-modal psychological intervention focusing on stress and anxiety are sufficient to relieve patients of their pain and trauma resulting from cancer. Through years of working with Chinese cancer patients and witnessing their growth and resilience, we were motivated to develop an Eastern Body-Mind-Spirit (BMS) Group Intervention model which has a strong emphasis on turning crisis into opportunities, and growth through pain. This model blends different intervention approaches, techniques, and outcome measures both from the East and the West. This paper describes our intervention approaches and discusses the theoretical background in relation to the concept of transformation and some qualitative findings which provide evidence for the study's applicability and effectiveness.

Little is known about cancer fatalism among younger women. Guided by the Patient/Provider/System Model, this descriptive study compares cancer fatalism and cancer knowledge among African American college students (n = 353) and women from primary care centers (n = 361). Their average age was 29 years. Data were collected using the Powe Fatalism Inventory and breast and cervical cancer knowledge scales. Women at health centers had higher cancer fatalism and lower cancer knowledge. Differences in life experiences may help explain these findings.

AB- There is a growing awareness of the importance of the emotional well-being of children with cancer and their families. The psychosocial team within a pediatric oncology setting strives to develop programs that may ease the psychological burden of cancer treatment. The Beaded Journey program is one example. The primary goal of this study was to systematically evaluate this program. Specifically, we were interested in parent and child perceptions of the value of the program. Thirty-nine families participated in a mail-out survey. Data were analyzed using descriptive, correlational, and qualitative techniques. Results indicate that the program is of value to families. Parents actually perceive it to be more valuable for themselves than for their children. Child age was moderately correlated with child value ratings. Parents reported that they expected that the Beaded Journey would be more valuable for their children when they were older.

Practical needs were information, accommodation, transport, and economic impact. A cross-sectional design was employed; data were collected by questionnaire and focus group interviews. Findings showed that practical needs impacted on the ability of the patients and families to cope with diagnosis and treatment for cancer. The greatest unmet practical need of the patients and their families was for comprehensive information that is provided before travelling and by someone, for example, nurse or social worker who can help them decipher it if required.

AB- This study explored the experiences and needs of nine parents who had received hospital-based bereavement support following the death of their child from cancer, in Western Australia. Six prominent themes emerged from thematic data analysis: personal grief, personal coping, concern for siblings of the deceased child, hospital bereavement support, community supports and unmet needs. Parents identified the need for more supportive contact from hospital staff during the palliative phase and following the child's death, early provision of information on how to practically and emotionally prepare for the death of their child, contact with other bereaved parents, and formal grief support for siblings. Areas for future research include exploration of parents' wish to become involved in activities to help others, bereavement support for siblings, the level of contact with the hospital unit that may be therapeutically beneficial, and parental behaviors associated with accessing both hospital and community-based bereavement supports.

AB- This paper, based on focus group interviews with mothers whose children have had cancer, describes the advocacy work in which mothers engaged during the period of diagnosis and treatment. Among the mothers' manifold responsibilities, advocacy was one of the most compelling. It was described as if it was a taken-for-granted moral imperative. Some mothers said they felt that it was necessary because of (1) perceived errors during diagnosis or later during the process of treatment; (2) perceived understaffing; (3) advice given by other mothers or fathers; and (4) perceived lack of coordination and communication in the medical care system. Many coped with the need to advocate through educating themselves, by keeping extensive notes and journals and by talking to other parents about their experiences. The paper concludes with clinical practice implications and recommendations for policy consideration including acknowledgment of the significant role of optimal family cohesion for managing the stresses and strains of advocacy and other home health care work; appointment of parent-child advocates associated with hospitals that provide pediatric oncology care; establishment of in-service training and education for guardians and medical care teams regarding their mutual roles and responsibilities; as well as, the provision of guaranteed and paid parental leave policies for guardians whose children have a catastrophic or severe chronic medical condition.

AB- This study examined the effect of combined Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises (PFME) and support group on quality of life of postprostatectomy patients. Twenty-nine participants learned PFME through biofeedback and were randomized to the control group (n = 15) and support group (n = 14). Assessment of quality of life was conducted at baseline and 3-month follow-up. The findings indicated a trend of increased functioning and reduced perception of illness intrusiveness in the support group, compared with the control group. Improved urinary continence was significantly associated with reduced depression and symptom distress over time. The findings suggest that an intervention focusing on urinary continence improves quality of life in these patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Although patient empowerment is widely acknowledged as important by health professionals it remains a somewhat nebulous concept. An initial empowerment measure has been developed through an extensive review of literature combined with a series of in-depth interviews of cancer patients concerning their use of coping strategies. The results were analysed for major themes in relation to sense of control over the illness. A set of twenty-eight statements were formulated from themes into a Likert-type scale for self-completion by 100 cancer patients. The scale could be used in assessing level of empowerment amongst cancer patients thereby establishing through this information, the patient's ability to make decisions about coping with their illness.

The study also compared the sample's HRQOL, as measured by the Short-Form 12 to the general, healthy United States population normative data. The data suggest that Latino survivors are reporting good HRQOL similar to the non-Latinos. The findings suggest that the paradigm of negative consequences of cure should be expanded to one, which also includes the positive impact of cure for ethnically diverse populations of childhood cancer survivors.

AB- Aim: Little is known about the long-term evolution of Quality of Life (QoL) for breast cancer treated patients. The study aims to describe this evolution of QoL in a group of Belgian breast cancer survivors. Methods: We gathered information on treatment, general health, activity problems, disease symptoms, pain, emotions, work, social activities, self-care, housekeeping, sexuality, and meaning of life. One hundred seventy-four disease-free survivors in Flanders (Belgium) participated in this study, which were grouped as being disease free less than one year (39), between one and five years (70), and more than five years (65). The data allowed us to analyse QoL for different dimensions over the three survivor groups. Results: The longer the survival time, the more QoL of breast cancer treated patients ameliorated and the less breast cancer had a major impact on QoL. Scores for doing intense activities, being tired, emotional health, social activities, and meaning of life were statistically significantly better in the long-term survivor group. The influence of breast cancer was more persistent for sexual QoL items. Conclusion: It is important for patients to know what they may expect after treatment. This kind of patient-reported information on the evolution of QoL is of great value to healthcare workers. Results may be used to encourage patients who are newly diagnosed with breast cancer or for patients who do not believe in further progress for some QoL aspects. When informing breast cancer patients, a fundamental difference has to be made between the several QoL aspects and time over which improvements may be expected.

AB- This study investigates factors correlated with the psychological well-being of parents of children with leukemia in China. A survey with self-administered questionnaires was employed and a total of 31 caregivers were recruited from two children's hospitals in Shanghai. The study investigates factors from three different aspects in the context of childhood cancer: children's illness-related and demographic variables, demographic variables of the parents, and the parents' coping approaches. The findings show that parents are at risk of poor psychological well-being related to perceived unsatisfactory financial status, and a lack of self-oriented coping approaches. The implications for social service provision are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This research project explores family caregiving processes during the first 100 days following autologous blood and marrow transplantation (ABMT). In this paper, we (1) explore patterns in caregiving, and ABMT recipient function early recovery from ABMT; (2) examine the relationships among caregiver demographics, relationship quality, preparedness, ABMT recipient function, predictability of caregiving, caregiver role strain and rewards of caregiving; and (3) examine the relative contribution of caregiver age, preparedness, relationship quality, and ABMT recipient function on caregiver role strain, and rewards of caregiving. Fifty-two family caregivers of ABMT recipients completed questionnaires about caregiving at hospital discharge, and again 2, 6, and 12 weeks following discharge. The amount of caregiving activities performed, and caregiver role strain, declined steadily from 2 weeks to 12 weeks of recovery. The caregiving situation was relatively predictable during recovery, and caregivers reported that caregiving was consistently rewarding. The caregiving activities rated as most difficult were those related to supporting recipients' emotional well-being. Strain from caregiving, although low, was explained by disruption in recipients' emotional and physical functioning, while caregiving rewards were explained by caregivers' preparedness for caregiving. Relationship quality, a significant predictor of strain in other samples, did not influence caregiving strain or rewards in this population. Caregiving processes delineated in studies of caregivers of persons with chronic illness are quite different from those described in this study. The acuity of the recipients' illness, the life threatening nature of the treatment, and the younger age of caregivers, and recipients, may underlie these differences.

AB- Qualitative interviews were used to investigate the impact of breast cancer among Latina survivors. The findings revealed that Latina survivors were optimistic about their health, utilized cultural and religious recovery practices; and seemed to accept their diagnosis, fears and suffering as part of their personal journey. The survivors' narrative identified spirituality as central to their recovery and coping. Extended family and friends were the primary sources of support. Common issues were the impact of cancer on medical care problems, work concerns, the meaning of cancer, family well-being, emotional well-being, body image, and sexual health. Latina survivors, particularly those who are poor and speak limited English, often have inadequate insurance, receive unsatisfactory medical care, and experience poor physician-patient communication and relationship. These problems are directly related to health-care system factors as well as socio-ecological and language issues. In addi-tion, many Latina survivors have inadequate resources and inaccurate beliefs that may affect their health care (e.g., delay, lack of follow-up), and overall quality of life. Results will inform a quantitative study with a larger sample of Latina breast cancer survivors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Studies of informal caregivers for people with cancer have primarily focused on the family, or personal factors that contribute to, or mediate the stress associated with providing care to a loved one. However, the majority of research models have failed to consider the role that workplace factors may play in caregivers' work-family conflict, and stress. This qualitative study identifies the workplace factors that inhibit or facilitate the ability of informal caregivers of cancer patients to provide care to a loved one and to determine the aspects of caregiving that hinder caregivers' ability to meet work responsibilities. Implications for further research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Prostate cancer is the most prevalent solid malignancy in men in the Netherlands. With regard to treatment, the focus of attention has shifted in the last decade from pure survival rates to health-related quality of life. HRQOL is affected differently by different treatments. The objective of this study is to assess the HRQOL related to treatment regime and time since diagnosis in Dutch men with prostate cancer. We conducted a cross-sectional study among 238 men with prostate cancer in a heterogeneous sample who filled in a general health-related quality-of-life measure (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and a prostate cancer specific quality-of-life instrument (the EORTC-QLQ-PR25) and a Joy-of-Life questionnaire. Men on hormonal treatment are doing worse compared with other treatments with respect to physical functioning, role functioning, fatigue, pain and sexual functioning. No differences were found between radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy on any of the HRQOL dimensions nor for time since diagnosis. In hormonal therapy, men who are diagnosed longer than two years ago report a worse cognitive functioning and more burdens from urinary problems.

AB- Utilizing a more representative sample than previous research, this study examines differences in breast cancer survivors' social, psychological, and physical quality of life by participation in breast cancer support groups. This research also explores whether all breast cancer survivors who participate in breast cancer support groups are benefiting equally. The sample includes 958 women of Eastern North Carolina (26% African American, 73% Caucasian) diagnosed with breast cancer who completed interviews concerning their experience with the disease, as well as their social, psychological, and physical well-being. Support group participation was found to have a significant positive affect on social and overall QOL; yet these affects on social QOL were found to be insignificant, and merely marginally significant concerning overall QOL when controlling for sociodemographics, other social support networks, and disease characteristics. Significant differences were found in the characteristics of participants and non-participants of breast cancer support groups and a number of these differences were found to have significant affects on QOL. These findings suggest that future research needs to investigate the relationships between participation in a breast cancer support group and measures of QOL while controlling for potential confounding factors.

AB- In psychosocial oncology social support is a recognized factor in facilitating adaptation to cancer. Spouses are often the first source of support for each other. However, the adaptation process of couples dealing with cancer has been little explored. This article presents the results of a qualitative study carried out with 16 couples, in each of which the woman had breast cancer. The goal of this study was to better understand the manner in which the couple as a dyad deals with the disruptions and demands related to the disease and its treatments. This report highlights the principal issues that confront couples in the first year after diagnosis and the adjustment strategies they use to deal with these issues. A theoretical understanding of the adjustment process of couples dealing with breast cancer emerges as a result of this study.

AB- This article reviews recent literature on age differences in psychological adjustment to breast cancer. Overall, studies have shown that older women experience less psychological distress in terms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Age differences in health status, treatment provision, social support, and other life circumstances may contribute to differential patient adjustment. Coping also may mediate the relationship between age and affective responses, but the confounding of coping and distress in widely used inventories precludes definitive conclusions. Future research should explore the contextual mechanisms underlying age differences in adjustment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The purpose of this paper is to discuss the profiles of women with breast cancer for whom a telephone interpersonal counseling intervention (TIP-C) was beneficial for symptom management and quality of life. This analysis was based on 24 participants who completed the telephone counseling intervention and all three measurements over the course of 10-week pilot study. The typical woman with breast cancer was white, in her mid-fifties and married at the time of the study. The majority was Stage II and was receiving chemotherapy as their primary adjuvant treatment. Preliminary findings suggest that women who were in long-term marriages and reported no previous history of depression or cancer benefited most from the intervention. These women reported less depression, negative affect, symptom distress and fatigue, and improved quality of life. Several theories are proposed for these findings and implications for practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- To simulate the longitudinal needs of patients treated for breast cancer, 2 groups of women were recruited. Patients within 6 months of diagnosis were considered in the early group and those 6-12 months after diagnosis were categorized as the late group. Participants were asked to identify effective and ineffective methods of psychosocial support and how those needs changed. Thirty-one women participated in the focus groups. Women in the early group identified problems related to their surgery and chemotherapy; those in the late group focused on symptoms associated with menopause. An exaggerated fear of disease recurrence and death were common to both groups. Most women found it difficult to strike a balance between wanting emotional support and wanting to be treated as normal. The provision of concrete medical information in the form of pathology and laboratory reports and information from health care professionals provided comfort and control. Spouses and partners were helpful in providing tangible assistance with transportation and childcare while female friends were more likely to share emotions. Organized support groups were helpful to only 13%. Participants acknowledged a need to learn how to identify their psychosocial needs and to ask for support from friends and family. Medical information provided patients with a sense of control and comfort. Women with breast cancer need to identify effective sources of emotional support and should be taught how to communicate those needs to their families and friends.

AB- The current study explored distress and adjustment over time and a woman's ability to find benefit in her experience of breast cancer. Over 700 women were initially assessed at a pre-diagnostic visit to a breast clinic. Of those who were originally diagnosed, 39 women participated in all four study assessments, completed over a two-and-one-half-year period following diagnosis. Compared to non-benefit-finders, women who reported finding benefits in their breast cancer experienced high levels of distress pre-diagnostically, which significantly declined over time. Results of the current study suggest that a woman's distress prior to receiving her diagnosis of breast cancer may be related to her ability to find benefit during later stages of her illness.

AB- Steadily rising breast cancer rates in America's women are forcing more men to confront challenges of living with a partner afflicted with this disease. This study assesses the impact of mutual emotional support as perceived by male partners on their adjustment to the diagnosis and the illness and on interactions between their perceived emotional support and their coping methods. Seventy-one male partners of newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients completed standardized instruments that measured emotional well-being, illness intrusiveness, emotional support, dyadic coping styles and demographic factors. Regression analysis revealed significant associations between perceived emotional support and men's coping strategies, and between coping styles and illness intrusiveness. Also, a history of depression predisposes men to poorer adjustment and affects their coping patterns. Findings suggest that as the health care system continues to relocate burden of care to partners and families, social workers must increase their understanding of how to effectively assist patients' partners. This study emphasizes the need to work with patients and partners to develop positive coping strategies as a couple. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The survivor uncertainty management intervention study is a randomized controlled study designed to test the efficacy of an intervention that combines training in audiotaped cognitive behavioral strategies to manage uncertainty about cancer recurrence with a self-help manual designed to help women understand and manage long-term treatment side effects and other symptoms. Specifically, women were taught to recognize their own personal triggers of uncertainty (places, events or surroundings, that bring back memories, feelings, or concerns about breast cancer), and then use coping skills such as relaxation, distraction, and calming self-talk to deal with uncertainty. Also, women were taught to use the manual as a resource for dealing with fatigue, lymphedema, pain and other symptoms. Treatment outcome data (Mishel et al., in press) indicated that the uncertainty management intervention resulted in improvements in cognitive reframing, cancer knowledge, social support, knowledge of symptoms and side effects, and coping skills when compared to a control condition. The purpose of the present paper was to report on the use and helpfulness of the intervention components by the 244 women who were in the intervention. Findings indicated that women regularly used the intervention components to deal with triggers of breast cancer recurrence and long-term treatment side effects and most women found the strategies very helpful.

Cancer patients completed measures describing their hope and affect, and a structured interview was conducted to ascertain their level of satisfaction with the support they were receiving. Results indicated that support satisfaction accounted for a statistically significant proportion of the variance in patient hope and affect, although other variables emerged as more powerful predictors.

AB- Prostate cancer affects men and their loved ones; consequently, survivors and their wives can gain from social support throughout the illness experience. After observing meetings of a support group for prostate cancer survivors and their partners, the authors used the constant comparison method to draw conclusions about the types of support generated in the men's and women's divisions of the group. The authors concluded that both divisions served as sites of information but not as scenes of practical assistance. The authors also found that the discursive practices of the groups and the structural elements of the group meetings inhibited emotional support through topic turning, comparisons between members, and the role of group facilitators. The authors consider the study's implications for support group leaders and scholars. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Patients and family members in a radiation oncology department participated in a study of a new education/orientation program. Information was presented in oral and in written form. After the intervention, orientation program participants did not differ significantly from control group members in state anxiety, general distress, treatment adherence, or knowledge of radiation therapy. Orientation group patients reported greater satisfaction with clinic care, and the orientation group was significantly more likely to utilize psychological counseling services within the clinic, as well as outside support. Discussion focused on possible explanations for the strikingly favorable program evaluations given by participants despite little evidence that the program was of significant benefit.

AB- It is estimated that as many as 80% of adult cancer patients use at least one form of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) during or after conventional treatment. Studies of physician-patient communication about the use of CAM have concluded that patients frequently do not tell their oncologists about their use of CAM and physicians consistently underestimate the numbers of their patients using CAM. The purpose of this multi-site study was to assess newly diagnosed cancer patients' and oncologists' communication practices with regard to complementary therapies. Patients (106 breast and 82 prostate) indicated which of 45 complementary therapies they were using while physicians at their institutions indicated which they supported. It is noted that, although we use the popular acronym "CAM," all patients surveyed were receiving conventional medical treatment. Thus, the survey addressed complementary therapies only. A large majority (84%) indicated they were using at least one therapy with the most popular being exercise, vitamins, prayer, and nutritional supplements. Surprisingly, the oncologists surveyed were generally enthusiastic and supportive of patients' use of complementary therapies. In addition to those therapies popular with patients, at least half the physicians supported massage, journal writing, support groups, acupuncture, biofeedback, and art therapy. However, discussions of CAM are relatively rare and most likely to be initiated by patients. When the topic is discussed, both patients and doctors say it usually enhances their relationship.

AB- Purpose: To determine differences and interdependencies between patients and their support-givers prior to PBSCT. Method: Patients and their principal support-givers completed the Illness-Specific Social Support Scale (ISSS), the Profile of Mood States, and the EORTC QLQ-C30. Results: One hundred fifty-five of 200 eligible patients replied. They nominated spouse/partner (70.6%), friends, and children as principal support source. Patients receiving social support from spouses reported a better HRQoL than patients who nominated other persons as the principal source of social support. Patients perceived more positive (p &lt; .01) and more problematic (p &lt; .05) social interactions than support-givers. The support-givers nominated: children (25.8%), spouse/partner, and siblings. Analysis showed an additional effect of gender and support-giving role (female patients scored worst in overall QoL, male support-givers best). Conclusion: Psychotherapeutic interventions should not only address the patients' problems but also the support-givers' questions, needs, and psychosocial burdens.

AB- Secondary traumatic stress (STS) represents a disorder that has the same symptoms as post traumatic stress disorder, but results from vicariously experiencing trauma through association with those directly encountering the traumatic event(s). This exploratory study examined STS in 21 oncology social workers who were members of the Association of Oncology Social Workers. The results of this study revealed that oncology social workers experienced compassion fatigue and burnout and that these variables were inversely related to compassion satisfaction. Other relationships between emotional involvement, ability to separate work from home, level of licensure, personal loss, and empathetic responsiveness were also examined.

AB- This study explored how Latinas diagnosed with a breast abnormality suspicious for cancer define and use social support while undergoing diagnostic follow-up and/or awaiting a definitive diagnosis. Qualitative data was collected and analyzed from 15 telephone interviews with Spanish-speaking women diagnosed with a breast abnormality suspicious for cancer. Findings indicated that social support was perceived as the comfort, caring, and esteem a person receives from others. With respect to family support, half of the participants felt female family members (e.g., daughters, mothers) were more supportive than male family members (e.g., fathers, sons) when discussing their illness. Many participants felt that asking for help from family members, friends, and health professionals was acceptable under medical circumstances and less justifiable under non-medical circumstances. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Latinas diagnosed with a breast abnormality suspicious for breast cancer are more likely to seek support from family members, friends and health professionals after a definitive diagnosis has been given. Additional research is needed to assess the impact of social support in increasing adherence to diagnostic follow-up procedures for a breast abnormality (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study used both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to assess the pediatric health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in siblings (n = 77) of cancer patients attending summer camp. On quantitative measures [Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) parent and child versions], siblings reported statistically significant improvements in HRQOL from pre- to post-camp. The parent sample, as a whole, did not report a statistically significant improvement in the siblings' HRQOL; however, statistically significant improvements were found when the analysis controlled for the responses of bereaved parents. On the qualitative measures (Sibling Qualitative Interview and Camp Okizu Satisfaction Surveys), both children and parents described the positive impact of camp. Using grounded theory, we identified the major themes and found that the positive emotional and social experiences captured by the quotes were paralleled in the quantitative findings of improved HRQOL in psychosocial domains on the PedsQL. These findings suggest the beneficial effects of camp as a psychological intervention and illustrate the value of integrating quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches in research.

AB- One way in which the psychosocial needs of cancer patients can be addressed is through support groups, which are often recommended to patients by healthcare professionals. The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Gilda's Club in meeting the needs of cancer patients during their first year of membership and whether their experience with this organization was a positive one. Thirty Gilda's Club members with cancer completed a semi-structured quantitative and qualitative questionnaire. Findings revealed over half of the sample participated in some type of support group and the majority of participants reported that the support groups were helpful, with only 10% of participants reporting that they did not receive help from the support group. Qualitative data revealed that the most common sources of support outside of Gilda's Club were family, friends, and church. Since their initial contact with Gilda's Club one year ago, 60% reported no change in their level of depression, 20% reported more depression, and 20% reported less depression. Most participants (57%) had received no counseling for depression, and only 20% were still receiving counseling for depression. Qualitative data also revealed the majority of participants had overall positive impressions of Gilda's club. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Although psychosocial coping techniques and supportive care services have been shown to improve cancer patients' quality of life, there is evidence that many of these strategies have not been widely integrated into the routine care of cancer patients. This study examined: (1) the extent to which cancer patients use certain coping strategies; (2) reasons for non-use; (3) perceived effectiveness of the coping strategies; (4) participants' interest in trying the strategies; and (5) if the strategies were recommended to participants. At the Northwestern Ontario Regional Cancer Centre in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, 292 outpatients (98% response rate) completed an in-person interview with a research assistant concerning seven individual coping strategies (music, breathing exercises, meditation, prayer, muscle relaxation, visualization/imagery, hypnosis/self-hypnosis) and four coping strategies offered through supportive care services (individual counselling, family counselling, support groups, religious support). Of all the coping strategies presented, prayer was used by the highest number (n = 186) of participants (64%). Music was the next most commonly used strategy, used by 43% (n = 124) of participants, and all other strategies were used by less than 30% of participants. The individualized approaches that are used for disseminating disease and treatment information to cancer patients should also be used to provide them with information on effective coping strategies.

AB- More children with cancer are receiving effective treatment, which allows for increased participation in everyday settings. Yet, little information is available about people's acceptance of children with cancer. This study examined young adults' acceptance ratings for a child receiving chemotherapy for cancer, a child with cancer in remission, and a physically healthy child. Findings did not provide support for a "cancer stereotype" and call into question whether results of studies using total or global scores from attitude scales should be taken at face value. Adults' responses suggested that they perceived children with cancer as experiencing primarily physical limitations (e.g., less strength and agility). Exposure to information about cancer was related to higher acceptance ratings for children described as having cancer, providing support for the importance of continued efforts to improve knowledge about the effects of this disease.

AB- This article provides an overview of research literature related to cancer support groups, with particular reference to prostate cancer groups. Randomized studies of cancer support groups primarily focus on short-term psychoeducational and/or supportive/expressive groups for women with breast cancer. Many of these studies suggest that the interventions lead to a pronounced improvement in psychological functioning and may in some instances increase longevity. Regarding prostate cancer support-group members, information and education are especially valued. Open-ended, psychoeducational groups with large meetings, expert speakers, and structured, efficient organizations appear most beneficial to prostate cancer group members. The literature only partially answers a number of significant questions, including the types of groups most appropriate for people with specific diseases, process variables most significant to the success of groups, and specific factors that are barriers to group involvement by certain populations.

AB- Many survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are challenged by physical, psychological, and social complications throughout the months and years post-transplant, as uncovered by many researchers during the past few years. The literature on the use of support groups for improving quality of life has mostly included studies of participants with solid tumor cancers. There is a paucity of literature describing the use of support groups with HCT survivors. The purpose of the present study is to describe the various issues that are discussed by participants in a monthly post-HCT support group. These issues have been described and grouped into themes by the authors. The results can provide a foundation about long-term effects of HCT that future research can investigate more closely, followed by research that can study interventions to assist in improving quality of life of HCT survivors. Recommendations for applying findings to current clinical practice using support groups are identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Breast cancer treatment can have a profound influence on a woman's physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. Anxiety, depression, anger, fatigue, and fear of recurrence are common responses to a diagnosis of breast cancer and undergoing breast cancer treatment. Women develop their own coping strategies for the pain and other effects of treatment. However, it is unclear whether there is a relationship between adaptation to pain and psychological distress during breast cancer treatment. Findings from the present study reveal that breast cancer patients who have better pain coping strategies also have lower levels of anxiety, fatigue and depression. These results suggest that pain coping interventions may reduce fatigue and psychological distress among women with breast cancer.

AB- The current study aimed to identify rates and predictors (demographic, treatment, and psychological variables) of state and cancer-specific anxiety among survivors of breast cancer. Data were collected through a structured telephone interview with 120 women who were at least one year posttreatment. Rates of state anxiety were substantially lower than were the norms for general medical patients. Cancer-specific anxiety was also mild. In hierarchical regression analyses, higher levels of trait anxiety were associated with state and cancer-specific anxiety (β = .73, p &lt; .001, and β = .34, p &lt; .001, respectively). Higher levels of risk perception were associated only with greater cancer- specific anxiety (β = .03, p = .057). The findings suggest the need for specificity in assessing anxiety among women with a history of breast cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The impact of supporting a dying family member has frequently been reported as extremely challenging. In addition, family members of dying cancer patients have consistently identified a need for additional guidance and support from health care professionals. Provision of high-quality palliative care services should include strategic support for families of patients confronted with a life-threatening diagnosis. To date, however, few published strategies clearly identify the most effective means of providing family support. The author seeks to provide a critical evaluation of past supportive interventions for family caregivers of dying cancer patients. The report confirms an urgent need for new supportive-care strategies for families to be tested. In addition, the review offers recommendations for designing and evaluating future family caregiver interventions. Psychoeducational interventions evaluated via randomized controlled trials are considered to be a priority. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study probed the effects of both level of existential meaning and coping processes on quality of life for patients with breast cancer. Results of bivariate correlation analyses with a sample of 248 women one to five years after diagnosis showed that a high level of meaning was strongly correlated with a high quality of life (r = .448, p &lt; .01). A negative relationship between coping processes and quality of life signaled an association between higher frequency of coping and decreased quality of life (r = -.331, p &lt; .01). Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that existential meaning and coping each contributed significantly to the variance in quality of life. In contrast to theories of coping, existential meaning and coping were unrelated constructs in the present study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article focuses on cancer fatalism as a barrier to regular cancer screening among African American and Hispanic women. The purpose of the study was to identify variables associated with cancer fatalism and to investigate the relationship of cancer fatalism and its correlates with adherence to screening for gynecological cancer. Study participants (83 African American women and 98 Hispanic women above the age of 18) were assessed on sociodemographic variables, family health history, current medical access and care, physicians' recommendations, cancer fatalism, and adherence to cancer screening. Multivariate analyses indicated that education was the only variable associated with cancer fatalism. Fatalistic beliefs toward cancer were not associated with adherence to gynecological cancer screening, but a physician's recommendation was. These data indicate that patient-physician communication is crucially important to cancer screening. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- There is significant interest in developing chemoprevention trials for women at high risk for breast cancer, yet it is not clear how acceptable these strategies are. Results of clinical trials with tamoxifen have demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of breast cancer in women at increased risk, but rates of participation in such trials have been lower than expected. No previous studies have assessed the attitudes of high-risk women toward participating in chemoprevention trials using drugs causing ovarian suppression. All women who had attended a large familial cancer clinic in Sydney, New South Wales, between 1994 and 2000 who were eligible for the Raloxifene and Zoladex Research study being piloted in the United Kingdom at the time were approached. Telephone interviews were conducted with the 35 high-risk women willing to participate in this study. Almost half the women surveyed expressed willingness to participate in a randomized trial, and slightly fewer women considered participating in a nonrandomized trial. The women who would consider participating were younger than those who would not. The most frequently mentioned reasons for interest in participating in trials were to aid research, help others, and learn more, which indicates that altruism may have played a significant part in the women's willingness to participate. Most women interviewed were participating in risk reduction and early detection strategies and expressed high interest in research screening tests. Given the interest in randomized trials and the fact that women at high risk for breast cancer consider the side effects as mainly acceptable, undertaking such trials may be worthwhile.

AB- Although many cancer survivors address cancer-related concerns through contact with fellow patients in support groups, few reports have focused on the experience of Asians and Pacific Islanders. This report summarizes the results of semistructured interviews with 24 participants in a well-established prostate cancer support group in Hilo, Hawaii, 17 of whom were of Asian or Pacific Islander ancestry. According to the men, the benefits of group participation include camaraderie, information, improved coping ability, and ability to discuss medical experiences. The group's success was attributed to its peer leadership, participation of peer-professionals, and members' widespread participation in a variety of activities. The group contributed to the larger community by organizing specific events for family members, interacting outside the meetings, and tailoring group activities to reflect multicultural preferences for communication. The experiences of the Hilo group contrast with the experiences of other support groups reported in the literature. Although information seeking in the group was important, emotional and social support was at least as significant, and use of humor and discussions of negative experiences regarding medical care were common. The group's distinctive features may stem from the values and norms of its close-knit, multiethnic, predominantly Asian and Pacific Islander small-town community. The findings imply that for prostate cancer support groups, one "size" does not fit all men and communities and that tailoring support groups to the intended participants is crucially important.

AB- This article addresses the psychological distress, internal and external coping resources, and coping strategies of carriers of the BRCA1/2 mutations based on a retrospective study conducted in the Oncogenetic Clinic at Rambam Medical Center in northern Israel. All women referred to the clinic between January 1999 and December 2000 were genotyped for the three predominant Ashkenazi mutations in BRCA1/2 genes, then counseled and asked to participate in the study. Of the 390 eligible women, 276 (70%) agreed to participate. To examine the independent effect of mutation carrier status (yes/no) as well as its interaction effect with breast cancer status (yes/no), the 276 participants were divided into four groups according to their BRCA1/2 mutation carrier status: 42 (15%) were carriers with breast cancer, 96 (34%) were noncarriers with breast cancer, 36 (13%) were carriers without breast cancer, and 102 (38%) were noncarriers without breast cancer. The psychological assessment included the Brief Symptom Inventory, Sense of Coherence, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Multidimensional Coping Inventory. Data analyses indicated that the mutation carriers without breast cancer reported the highest levels of findings that call for further research and clinical attention to be focused on this group of women. distress (F = 8.9; p &lt; .01) and the lowest levels of internal and external coping resources (F = 4.7, p &lt; .05, and F = 4.9, p &lt; .01, respectively),findings that call for further research and clinical attention to be focused on this group of women.

AB- Interviews from a community study of 30 bereaved spouses were used to explore the extent to which spouses take advantage of their partner's terminal illness for cognitive, emotional, practical, and interpersonal accommodation to impending death. Emphasis is placed on the strains of terminal illness, including ruptures in spousal intimacy, separation anxiety, the undermining of the world as a safe place, and the traumatic helplessness of watching a loved one die. In contrast to the literature on anticipatory grief, which emphasizes the advantages of forewarning in cushioning postmortem adjustment, the authors found that terminal illness presents spouses with stressors that outweigh the benefits of, and often preclude the undertaking of, anticipatory tasks.

AB- This study aimed to establish the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity among cancer patients' caregivers and to identify markers of risk. Using the Psychiatric Assessment Schedule (a standardized psychiatric interview), the authors assessed 222 caregivers retrospectively. Thirty-one caregivers (14%) had developed an affective disorder during the two years since the patients' initial cancer diagnoses. Caregivers who were the patient's partner were more likely to develop anxiety, depression, or both when their ill spouse had developed these symptoms. Notably, the prevalence of affective disorders among female caregivers was comparable to the prevalence among patients (23%). Female nonpartner caregivers developed disorders as frequently as partners did. Female caregivers with a prior history of affective disorder who reported more illness-related concerns appeared to be at particular risk, providing useful markers for clinical practice.

AB- Health maintenance activities and involvement of lay sources of decision-making support can affect cancer patients' well-being and decisions about care during active treatment and long-term survivorship. Because most cancer patients are older than 60 years, examining these variables in older cancer survivors is important. In this study, 316 older long-term cancer survivors were asked about health maintenance activities and involvement of lay sources of decision-making support during the diagnosis and treatment of cancer (then) and long-term survivorship (now). Because of the wide age range in older cancer survivors, two age groups were compared: 190 young-old survivors aged 60 to 74 years (M = 67 years, SD = 3.8 years) and 126 old-old survivors aged 75 years or older (M = 80 years, SD = 4.8 years). A larger percentage of young-old than old-old survivors reported using health maintenance activities and lay sources of decision-making support, both then and now. Age-group differences were most apparent in the use of diet/vitamins, meditation, and information about cancer and in involvement of other cancer patients in decision making about care. Also, compared to the old-old age group, young-old survivors used more types of health maintenance activities and lay sources of decision-making support then and now. Health maintenance activities were correlated with lay sources of decision- making support only in the young-old age group. Social workers should be attentive to potential aging and cohort-related differences in assessing older adults' preferences and barriers to use of health maintenance activities and lay sources of decision-making support during active treatment and long-term survivorship.

AB- This study investigated the ways in which 140 recently diagnosed cancer patients participated in treatment decisions. The most prevalent behavior was the tendency to adopt the recommendations of their physicians without actively participating in decision making, followed by rational vigilant decision making (systematically collecting and processing medical information to find the best choice) and impulsive hypervigilant decision making (unsystematically processing information and choosing the first option). The tendency to adopt the oncologists' recommendations without active participation in decision making was predicted by patients' higher age, external health-related locus of control, and low-to-moderate cognitive abilities. Vigilant decision making was associated with higher cognitive abilities and educational attainment, and hypervigilant decision making was associated with lower cognitive capabilities and an external locus of control. Depression was not related to decision-making behavior. The results indicate a need to adapt the provision of medical information and support in the process of decision making to patients' resources and expectations regarding participation in treatment decisions.

AB- This article describes a study in which a systematic classification of cancer patients was produced on the basis of their needs. A series of 380 cancer patients from four hospitals in the North West of England responded to a self-completion questionnaire that included a 48-item inventory of psychosocial needs covering seven needs domains (information, health professionals, emotional and spiritual, identity, practical, support, and child care). Latent class analysis was used to identify differing patterns of psychosocial need. Four patterns of need were identified. The groups differed in both quantity and quality of patients' expressed needs. Group A had a high level of expressed needs "across the board," whereas Group D had a low level of expressed needs "across the board." Group B had high levels of expressed needs in all except the emotional, spiritual, identity, and practical domains, and Group C had low levels of expressed needs in all but the information and health professionals domains. Because the four groups differed by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, there is scope for developing risk scores to predict these patterns of psychosocial needs in patients with cancer. The dangers and limitations of this approach are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- A limited literature on the experiences of late adolescent and young adult survivors of cancer identifies psychosocial issues and needs that are unique to this population. Although the advocacy needs of adult cancer survivors have been addressed increasingly in both the psychooncology literature and in educational programs, the advocacy needs of adolescent and young adult survivors have not. This article reports the findings of an exploratory study conducted with pediatric oncology social workers who are frequently asked to assist survivors and their families with the psychosocial issues related to cancer. The quantitative and qualitative data collected through surveys and a focus group support the findings of previous studies that this population faces unique concerns related to surviving cancer based on the developmental stage at which cancer occurs. The study participants also identified the advocacy training needs of this population and made recommendations for interventions to build on survivors' strengths and empower them as they adapt to the roles, responsibilities, and challenges of adulthood.

AB- Families of pediatric oncology patients vary widely in the use of hospital-based psychosocial support services. In a retrospective case-note analysis, potential predictor variables for use of hospital-based social work services were investigated. Results showed that a negative shift in parental paid employment status occurred for 58% of families, with an average loss of family income of approximately 53%. After controlling for disease and family demographic characteristics, including treatment intensity, the significant predictors for higher use of social work services were the timing of a negative shift in parental employment status relative to confirmation of the diagnosis and the need to obtain welfare services. Furthermore, the families of patients with brain tumors, compared with the families of patients with other solid tumors and leukemias, may have different needs concerning hospital-based psychosocial support, depending on the patient's treatment. The data have important implications for planning services, especially for caseloads that require social work staff to balance welfare-related tasks and other professional psychosocial support activities, such as counseling.

AB- This pilot study explored the influence of religion and spirituality on coping among survivors of prostate cancer. Thirty-eight men (14 African Americans and 24 Caucasians) completed a self-administered survey; 29 of the men participated in five focus group sessions. Four major themes emerged from these sessions: (1) the beneficial effect of faith or religious belief on coping with the disease, (2) the multiple functions of church social and spiritual support and educational forum, (3) the durability of faith in God, and (4) the distinction between religion and spirituality (institutional versus personal). Consistent with the group sessions, the survey data indicated that a majority of participants reported a high degree of religiosity, measured by denominational affiliation and attendance at places of worship. The data also showed that having prostate cancer influenced greater religious attendance, with the change attributed to a desire to gain spiritual support. Racial comparisons showed that the African American men had higher levels of religiosity than the Caucasian men did, as measured by church attendance, quality of spiritual life, and importance of God in the recovery process.

AB- A group intervention to reduce emotional and behavioral problems in siblings of children with cancer was evaluated. Forty-seven siblings aged 6 to 14 years participated in seven groups, with 4 to 9 siblings in each group. Groups consisted of eight weekly two-hour sessions guided by a manual. Four assessments were conducted: two before the intervention and two after the intervention. Children completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and behavior; parents reported on siblings' anxiety and behavior. After the intervention, siblings reported significantly reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, and parents reported significant reductions in siblings' anxiety and behavior problems. An interaction between intervention, age, and gender indicated that adolescent girls had more depressive symptoms than adolescent boys did before the intervention and younger girls did after the intervention. The findings suggest that group intervention benefits siblings of children with cancer, with age and gender influencing this effect.

AB- Data from 131 consecutive adult patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at a tertiary care center from 1997 to 1999 suggest that the presence of an in-hospital lay care-partner during the patients' hospital stay is a powerful prognostic variable of survival. One year after the transplant, 75% of the patients with a lay care-partner were alive versus 26% of those without a care-partner. A multivariable survival analysis revealed not having an in-hospital lay care-partner as a significant independent risk factor for death (p &lt; .001). This relationship held when adjusting for other such risk factors: i.e., primary diagnosis, disease status, and source of donor marrow. The idiosyncratic nature and importance of partnered relationships for survival in allogeneic BMT and the need to intervene and improve outcomes for patients are discussed with regard to future research and clinical programs.

AB- The present study evaluated the use of an annual seminar day for families of children diagnosed with cancer in the preceding 12 months. The main objective was to explore the relationship between various measures of parental psychological health and the likelihood of attending the seminar. In line with clinical observation, the authors hypothesized that the families that did not attend the seminar day would have a higher profile of distress on a range of variables in the weeks before the seminar. The measures included current sources of support (psychosocial and material), mother-partner functioning, and maternal depression, anxiety, and stress. Of 56 families that participated, 20 also attended the seminar day. The results showed a range of clinically and statistically significant differences between families in the direction of the hypothesis. After controlling for time since diagnosis, the mother's level of psychological distress and the perceived level of discord in the mother-partner relationship were higher and more intimately related constructs in families that declined to participate in the seminar day. Overall, the results suggested that seminars, of the type discussed in the article, may be of maximal perceived relevance for families that received a diagnosis of childhood cancer within the previous three months.

AB- This pilot qualitative study explored experiences and effects of spirituality and religion among lesbians diagnosed with cancer. A convenience, sample of eight self-identified lesbians diagnosed with cancer responded to advertisements for the study. Each woman was interviewed, and interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. The results indicated that all participants found support in spirituality, though definitions of this term varied. Five women found religion supportive, but not one participant still worshipped in the tradition in which she was raised. The participants' identification as lesbian affected their relationships with all sources of support, including spirituality and religion. This finding suggests that clinicians working with cancer survivors should include spiritual and religious beliefs in their assessments and treatment planning, and further research on the experiences of lesbians with cancer is needed.

AB- Published literature on survivors of breast cancer suggests that a small subset of survivors will develop moderate-to-severe psychopathology. The current study aimed to develop and pilot a needs-assessment questionnaire specifically for survivors of the disease. An initial qualitative phase generated items for inclusion in a "Survivors Module" needs-assessment instrument. In the second phase, 95 survivors in remission were asked to complete the Survivors Module as well as measures of depression and anxiety, menopausal symptoms, and quality of lire. Two weeks later, they completed the Survivors Module again to establish test-retest reliability. Initial pilot testing of the Survivors Module suggests that the module is a valid and reliable instrument, although further validation and analysis of its psychometric properties using a larger sample would be warranted. A large minority of survivors were found to have many unmet psychosocial needs in a number of areas, particularly in the domain of needs regarding information and medical communication. Unmet needs for help in coping with breast cancer also were prevalent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In addition to biomedical forms of treatment, many cancer patients have elected to use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) of a spiritual or religious nature. However, the effectiveness of such spiritual and religious interventions is uncertain. Using a meta-analytic approach, the present study synthesized available treatment-outcome studies on spiritual and religious interventions for cancer patients to determine the efficacy of such interventions. Effect sizes were calculated for three types of outcome measures: biological, psychological, and spiritual. The authors found that nondrug spiritual and religious interventions produced small to moderate effect sizes for treatment versus control comparisons and small effect sizes for pre-versus posttreatment comparisons. Studies that used psychedelic drugs to promote spiritual experiences produced large effect sizes for both treatment versus control and pre- versus posttreatment comparisons. Finally, they found that, overall, treatment versus control comparisons produced larger effect sizes than did pre- versus posttreatment comparisons. Limitations of the studies discussed in the present meta-analysis included the lack of control groups, randomization, and a large number of participants. The results suggest that there is a shortage of sufficiently detailed, high-quality treatment outcome studies examining the efficacy of spiritual and religious interventions for oncology patients.

AB- This study examined the degree of psychological distress experienced by parents of children with cancer in relation to five religious coping methods: collaborative, active surrender, passive deferral, pleading for direct intercession, and self-directed religious coping. Parents of 166 children with cancer from four hospitals completed the Religious Coping Methods to Gain Control subscale of the Religious/Spiritual Coping (RCOPE) scale and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). On the average, BSI scores indicated high levels of distress compared with adult norms. Collectively, the five coping methods accounted for 19% of the variance in participants' psychological distress. As predicted, collaborative religious coping was uniquely associated with lower distress. Contrary to hypotheses, pleading for direct intercession was associated with greater reported distress.

AB- Difficult ethical problems are often faced by patients, families, and social workers who assist in decision-making around issues regarding end-of-life care. In qualitative interviews with 12 hospital social workers in one large urban cancer center, common ethical issues identified through thematic analysis were preservation of patients' autonomy/self-determination, beneficence of health care providers, and medical futility of end-of-life treatments. Continued communication with all parties involved was key in resolving ethical problems. Discussion, along with referrals of more complex cases to ethics committees and ethics consultation teams, also occurred. Participants further indicated the potential helpfulness of developing practice guidelines for social workers dealing with decision making about end-of-life care.

AB- This study investigated the effects of parental functioning on adolescent adjustment during the acute phase of treatment for mothers diagnosed with breast cancer. Data from self- and parent-report questionnaires were obtained in the homes of 87 adolescents and 174 parents within six months of the mother's diagnosis. Associations between adolescent adjustment (self-esteem, behavioral problems, anxiety) and parental functioning (depressed mood, parenting quality, and marital adjustment) were examined when neither, one, or both parents were functioning at compromised levels. When both parents had depressed mood, adolescents tended to show increased behavioral problems; maternal depressed mood was the main source of influence. When the quality of the parenting relationship between the adolescent and both parents was poor, adolescents showed significantly lowered self-esteem and increased anxiety. Marital adjustment did not affect adolescent functioning significantly. Maternal depressed mood and the quality of the parent-child relationship significantly influenced adolescent adjustment during the acute phase of the mother's breast cancer.

AB- Current studies indicate that rates of mammography use in the general population fall below objectives set by leading health agencies. This is even more true in the African-American community. This study used the health belief model as the theoretical basis of a secondary data analysis to establish differences in health beliefs among African- American and Caucasian women related to mammography. Data were obtained from members of the Indiana University Medical Group and from outpatients of the General Medicine Clinic, Barnes-Jewish Hospital, in St. Louis, Missouri. Data analysis was conducted using structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the health belief model explained approximately 13% of the variance associated with Caucasian women's compliance with mammography and approximately 9% of the variance for African-American women, with differences between specific variables that appeared to have the most explanatory power. These findings indicate that the model, although a good starting point, does not completely explain the differences that exist between health beliefs or behavior regarding mammography among the two groups of women.

AB- The view that psychological factors play a role in the onset and progression of cancer has been promoted widely in the popular media. The present study assessed the prevalence of this view. The respondents- 527 members of the public, 239 cancer patients, and 117 medical practitioners working in oncology-completed a survey questionnaire consisting of three questions in a yes/no format on whether they believed psychological factors can affect the cause, progression, and cure of cancer. Each question was followed by a Likert-scale question asking respondents to estimate the strength of such an effect. The majority of respondents in the public sample endorsed the proposition that psychological factors affect cause (60%), progression (71%), and cure (72%). A larger proportion of patients endorsed the proposition for progression (85%) and cure (86%). Oncologists were less likely to endorse it for cause (12%) and cure (26%). These relationships also held for estimates of the strength of the effect. In the public sample, females and respondents with a university education provided higher estimates of the effects of psychological factors on cancer. These differences were not evident in the patient sample. Given that the scientific evidence to support the "mind-cancer" view is equivocal, the question of whether these perceptions should be challenged needs to be addressed.

AB- Because minority women remain underusers of mammography screening, strategies to increase preventive health behavior may involve affordable screening as well as cultural determinants. Most studies have used a theoretical model inconsistently to assess characteristics, such as attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions about adherence to screening, whereas other studies have lacked sociocultural dimensions that may be relevant in promoting repeat screening in certain populations. This two-phase study examined adherence to mammography screening among 150 African-American women aged 40 to 49 years who had received one to live mammograms. Phase I included an elicitation procedure, a focus group, and pretests as steps in constructing a telephone interview. In Phase II, 150 telephone interviews were completed. Women's intentions regarding repeat mammography screening were assessed using the theory of planned behavior, expanded to include sociocultural, religious, and psychological variables. Only the attitude and perceived behavioral control components of the theory explained the women's intentions. In the expanded model, a positive previous experience with mammography, low income and educational level, positive beliefs about breast health, and lack of trust in health care providers explained increased intention to have another mammogram. The study's clinical and policy implications were positive: When low-income African- American women are exposed to screening programs that provide positive experiences with mammography and include a strong component to enhance adherence, their intention to seek repeat screening increases. This level of health care needs to be adopted as standard practice for optimal breast health among all women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In Part I, the authors pointed out that despite the increasing focus on communication in psychosocial oncology, a comprehensive review of the literature revealed that the primary emphasis has been individuals' self-reported experiences rather than naturally occurring interactions between cancer patients, family members, and health professionals. Thus, an empirical foundation for understanding communication activities is in its infancy. In Part II, the authors provide an overview of "conversation analysis" as an alternative method for studying patterns of interaction during medical encounters and family interactions. Transcribed excerpts from ongoing research, focusing on how family members talk through cancer on the telephone, exemplify how "news delivery sequences" and "managing optimism" are crucial resources for understanding and dealing with cancer journeys. The authors conclude by discussing the need for discernment between self-report and interactional data, the usefulness of conversation analysis for oncology professionals, and the possibilities for collaborative research.

AB- The overall objective of the present research was to obtain information about the home health care work that parents complete when their children have been diagnosed with cancer. The authors specifically examined factors that affect mothers' abilities to cope after the diagnosis. The interviews, completed with 25 mothers whose children had been diagnosed with cancer within the previous five-year period, were designed to allow the women to share their experiences with childhood cancer. From this process, the mothers identified many salient issues, one of which was coping and factors that affected their ability to cope. The coping subthemes identified included (1) feelings of adversity, anger, and despondency, (2) religion, faith, and God, (3) taking control, (4) gender and marital issues, (5) taking care of self, and (6) positive outlook, facing reality, and normalcy. The research provided mothers with a "voice" by allowing them to express their stories and experiences about having a child with cancer or, more particularly, about salient issues surrounding coping. To prepare for the immediate needs of women with chronically ill children and the needs of their families and their ill children, it is essential for policy makers to obtain more information about the women's workloads.

AB- Major gaps in knowledge exist about the value of a therapeutic group conducted by telephone conference call for patients with breast cancer. This article describes the evaluation of such a group. Three goals established for the evaluation were to determine whether (1) therapeutic factors were operational within the group, (2) differences in group climate were reported, and (3) therapeutic factors could be identified from group transcripts. Results from the Support Group Evaluation, the Group Climate Questionnaire Short Form, and a content analysis supported the occurrence of therapeutic factors within the telephone group sessions. Therapeutic processes described in the telephone group were similar to processes found in traditional forms of groups. Telephone groups are valuable sources of support for patients despite a lack of face-to-face interaction. Researchers would benefit by replicating these methods as a means of establishing the integrity of interventions for groups, and clinicians would gain insight into improving clinical leadership skills for telephone support groups.

AB- African-American women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than are White women but are more likely to be adversely affected. Although differences in incidence and mortality have been explored in some depth, little attention has been paid to how these women cope with the disease or whether their appraisal of their breast cancer differs from that of White women. Using a comparative design, this study analyzed the differences in appraisal between African-American and White women with breast cancer. The findings suggest that no differences exist between African-American and White women's appraisal of their breast cancer. The type of primary appraisal used most by both groups was harm to their health, safety, and physical well-being. The secondary appraisal used most was that breast cancer was an experience they had to accept. Possible links between appraisal and cognitive representations of illness and suggestions for further research on the appraisal are discussed.

AB- Living through early stage breast cancer is not simply about overcoming a short-term crisis. The lived experience of women at the completion of adjuvant treatment calls for a reconsideration of the timing and type of psychosocial interventions provided. A Post Adjuvant Treatment Support Program (PATS) was developed and piloted over a nine-month period with pleasing results. The program aims to mark the end of treatment and promotes active coping through sharing common experiences, normalizing responses to completion of treatment, encouraging consideration of the meaning of the experience, and facilitating the use of stress management and cognitively based coping skills. Innovative methods to encourage focused group discussion are being developed. The intervention addresses the specific and previously unmet needs of women at the end-of-treatment phase of early stage breast cancer.

AB- Although increasing attention is paid to communication in psychosocial oncology, a comprehensive review of the literature reveals that emphasis has been given to individuals' self-reported experiences. Because naturally occurring interactions between cancer patients, family members, and health professionals have not received systematic attention, the authors propose that an empirical foundation for understanding communication activities is in its infancy. In this two-part article, Part I expands on how communication has been identified as central to family relationships, yet has been accessed through individuals' reports. Specific examples drawn from both qualitative and quantitative research methods illustrate the predominance and limitations of self-reports for studying communication and psychosocial oncology. Part II provides an overview of "conversation analysis" as an alternative method for studying interactional patterns in medical encounters and family interactions. The discussion focuses on the usefulness of conversation analysis for oncology professionals and the possibilities for collaborative research.

AB- Research has generally suggested that positive life circumstances may help alleviate the distress brought on by breast cancer. Little attention has been paid to the effects of negative life circumstances on women's adjustment to the disease. In this study, 110 women answered in writing an open-ended question about life circumstances (positive, negative, or both) that they perceived to have influenced their experience with breast cancer. Many women described both positive and negative circumstances, but negative circumstances were reported more commonly. The women described 28% of the negative circumstances as more salient or more distressing than breast cancer; these circumstances were coded as "negative distracting" circumstances. Exploratory regression analyses found that positive circumstances were associated with better adjustment and negative circumstances were associated with poorer adjustment. In addition, distracting circumstances were associated with better adjustment. Findings suggest that considering breast cancer in the context of women's lives is important.

AB- Reviewed the research literature on psychosocial oncology over the past decade to assess the prevalence and contribution of articles on peer support. Using CD-Rom databases, 25 articles were retrieved for review. In each article, patients or their family members were the target group for supportive interventions, which were primarily for the delivery of peer support and included either a qualitative or quantitative evaluation of the program. A definitional taxonomy for peer support interventions, which identified eight discrete settings, was derived from three key dimensions: style of supervision, interpersonal context, and mode of delivery. The studies suggested that peer support programs help by providing emotional and informational support from the perspective of shared personal experience. However, a paucity of research-particularly randomized controlled trials-was noted. The reasons may include inherent difficulties in isolating for study what is essentially a naturalistically occurring interpersonal dynamic from the complex social and community contexts from which it emanates. The authors discuss the gap between practice and theory in this area and recommend a broader and more inclusive view of supportive care for people with cancer.

AB- This study explored the psychosocial characteristics of women with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer who were or were not interested in joining support groups. Ninety-three women using breast cancer services at a teaching hospital were interviewed about their decision to attend or not attend a support group. At an average of 7.4 months after the diagnosis, 21.5% of the women had attended a support group, whereas 59.1% reported they would not attend. Attenders were likely to be better educated, to live outside the metropolitan area, and to report poorer mental health. Exploring interviewees' reasons for their decision allowed suggestions for promoting attendance for women who may benefit from attending a support group: explain clearly at the recruitment stage what groups offer, perhaps using videos or testimonials; consider routine screening for psychological distress or perceptions of inadequate support: and accept that many women will feel no need to participate in a support group and probably should not be pressed to do so.

AB- To address the needs of patients presenting to a radiation oncology practice, a psychosocial assessment was integrated into the initial evaluation. This article presents the findings in 902 19-98 yr old patients evaluated during a two-year period. Although interventions were clustered around groups with poor prognoses and lower economic background, a considerable number of patients with better outlook and support required or benefited from counseling, education, or referral to community resources. The authors propose that psychosocial assessment and proactive interventions should be part of the initial care of every patient diagnosed with cancer. Partnering with agencies with similar goals puts this approach within reach of private practices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a growing aspect of how patients respond to having cancer. CAM is not solely a set of clinical interventions, it is a broad social movement that seeks to recast the meaning of health and illness. Professionals in psychosocial oncology need such a perspective to truly understand why patients are turning toward CAM. CAM's appeal emerges from its five core beliefs: holism, vitalism, spirituality, a positive definition of health, and a distinctive view of the healing process. These five beliefs are well matched to how many people with cancer experience their bodies and illness, and they also form a coherent response to the difficulties many patients have when dealing with conventional medicine. Increasingly, some elements in conventional medicine are accepting of CAM. Hospital chains, managed care organizations, drug companies, and retailers of health care products are less likely to make sharp distinctions between CAM and conventional care. CAM is likely to continue growing as a factor in the professional lives of health professionals who deal with cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Sisyphus has long been a central metaphor for my work. Sharing this myth at a national oncology social work conference many years ago was the beginning of my real professional growth. It clearly struck a chord for many who work day-in, day-out to lighten the burden for others while shouldering a heavy load themselves. In thinking about what oncology social workers do and about courage, I did a lot of reading about heroism. I have been an oncology social worker for 24 years, and I have been a woman living with breast cancer for 10 years. This juxtaposition of my professional and personal lives has taken me on a journey with rewards beyond measure. It becomes increasingly clear that we DO make a difference. There most certainly are situations in which no one can take away the pain, but someone who dares to be human can blunt some of the terror and share some of the sadness. We must become exquisitely aware of our own feelings. We must take care that our own need to be needed--one primary reason we do this work--does not dominate us and our relationships. We do not have to be, and cannot be, "omnicompetent" or a supercaregiver. We must keep our antennae well oiled so we notice when we are feeling irreplaceable.

AB- This study investigated long-term social and behavioral outcomes in 40 children with brain tumors. Demographic, medical, cognitive, and psychosocial predictors at short-term follow-up at Time 1 (one to two years postdiagnosis) were used to predict long-term social and behavioral outcomes three to four years after diagnosis (Time 2). Below-average social competence and average overall behavioral ratings were reported at Time 2. Multiple medical treatments and lower social competence scores at Time 1 were significant predictors of long-term difficulties concerning social competence, whereas lower socioeconomic status and higher total scores regarding behavior problems at Time 1 were the best predictors of long-term behavioral problems. The results of the study have implications for mental health screening and intervention during the early years after diagnosis.

AB- Hope and Cope, a voluntary self-help organization cancer patients and their families, was evaluated as part of a randomized controlled clinical trial of newly diagnosed patients with breast or colon cancer. Measures of psychosocial distress, functional well-being, and optimism were evaluated four months after diagnosis (Time 1) and eight months later (Time 2). There were differences between the users and nonusers at Time 1: Users of Hope and Cope had greater needs but became more satisfied regarding resolution of their needs at Time 2 than did nonparticipants. The outcome of physical well-being was significantly higher for those who took part in Hope and Cope. Participants of voluntary support organizations appear to make appropriate choices on the basis of their needs. Issues of patients' preference have not been given sufficient attention in psychosocial oncology research and may influence the results of such studies.

The questionnaire had a response rate of 46% and revealed long-term effects on the participants' adjustment and coping abilities. Results are discussed qualitatively regarding the informational and psychosocial needs of patients with breast cancer. Benefits of the group for these women included acquisition of new information, increased long-term coping skills, spiritual and emotional support, and assistance with psychosocial issues (e.g., self-concept, sharing, emotional expression, family/relationships). Also discussed are issues affecting the groups' success, including patient engagement, structural issues (group topics and size, heterogeneity of membership), the diverse learning styles, patients' needs and levels of literacy, the facilitator's role, and the role of talk and trust in support groups.

AB- This study examined depressive symptoms in 475 patients with cancer and in a reference group of 255 individuals without cancer from the general population and the associations of those symptoms with sociodemographic and medical factors. Depressive symptoms were measured at 3 months (Time 1) and 15 months (Time 2) after diagnosis. Patients reported more depressive symptoms than the reference group did at Times 1 and 2. Younger age, specially, was related to the onset of depressive symptoms after a cancer diagnosis. Better-educated patients and those with a lower stage of disease reported a greater decrease in depressive symptoms over time. The authors conclude that certain sociodemographic factors may primarily reflect general dysfunction or vulnerability rather than risk factors for developing depressive symptoms after a diagnosis of cancer.

AB- This article focuses on differences between African-American and White older adults who were long-term survivors of cancer regarding reported health problems, symptoms of illness, functional difficulties, health worries and concerns, and overall perceptions of health. A conceptual model examined the relationship between demographic factors (e.g., race, age, cancer- and treatment-related factors) and perceptions of health (e.g., burden of disability, health concerns and worries, and self-rated global health). Regression analysis examined quantitative data from in-person interviews with 180 survivors (older than 58 years of age) of breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer obtained from the tumor registry of the Ireland Cancer Center at University Hospitals Health System of Cleveland. African Americans were oversampled to represent 50% of the total sample. The analysis indicated that African Americans experienced poorer functional health after cancer, even after disease and treatment factors were controlled for. However, compared with White survivors, African Americans did not report significantly more symptoms attributed to either cancer or its treatment, suggesting that their poorer health after cancer may not have been a result of either factor but to other comorbid conditions...

AB- In an effort to heighten the awareness of the high school population, a support group program for young people whose parents were diagnosed with cancer received funding to produce an educational video titled Hear How I Feel. This article reports on the evaluation of the video by 146 high school teachers, guidance counselors, and students; elementary school teachers; university undergraduate social work students; and health care and social service providers. A qualitative analysis of the evaluations indicated that high school teachers and guidance counselors were reluctant to use the video in the high school setting because they could not respond expertly to emotions that might be elicited. The findings suggest that youths desire a forum in which difficult issues can be addressed, teachers and guidance counselors need training that would enhance their skill in responding to students' emotional responses, and cancer patients and their families have psychosocial needs that must be met.

AB- A diagnosis of breast cancer requires a woman to cope with a variety of physical and psychosocial challenges that are not faced in isolation. Interpersonal relationships are the context for appraisal, development of coping strategies, and defining of resources for adaptation to a serious illness. Of particular interest is the couple relationship. The level of complexity in understanding the process of adaptation is far greater when considering the impact of each partner's response on the other partner's coping strategies and the interactive management of the emotional recovery. The purpose of this study was to understand the specific processes that developed within the partner relationship as the couple began the process of recovery. Case-intensive interview data were analyzed using an interpretive methodology to construct the dyadic process of the woman and her partner. Ss were 15 couples (men ranged in age from 30 to 54 years; women from 29 to 51 years). The data analysis revealed two types of processes: one process in which the patient's and partner's thoughts, feelings, and emotions were acknowledged; the other in which their thoughts, feelings, and emotions were moderated or minimized in some way. These patterns were present across couples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This article addresses preferences for psychosocial interventions in newly diagnosed cancer patients in a multiethnic sample consisting of Americans of European, Filipino, Native Hawaiian, and Japanese ancestry. Patients who were diagnosed with cancer four to six months before the study were identified through consecutive registrations on the Hawai'i Tumor Registry. Data were collected through personal interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Among 194 patients who participated in the study, 162 (84%) reported experiencing cancer-related stress. Although few patients had participated in supportive interventions, there was considerable interest in these techniques. Most patients had received information about diagnosis and treatment, but only 10% had received information about psychological counseling. When preferences for supportive interventions were linked with demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age, and ethnicity), the most consistent finding was higher levels of interest among Filipino patients. Additional research examining ethnic differences in preferences for psychosocial support is warranted. Because of the potential for greater use of behavioral therapies by patients, educating providers about the availability, efficacy, and patients' interest in such...

However, research about barriers to participation that compromise adherence and subsequent benefits has been identified as needed. The purposes of this article were to (1) systematically review the barriers to research and make recommendations, (2) consider unique symptoms of disease and treatment regarding their barrier-related impact on exercise therapy, and (3) present an organizational framework that will aid the investigation and understanding of barriers as they affect adherence to prescribed exercise therapy for cancer treatment and recovery.

The degree to which reports of posttraumatic growth by 41 women (aged 37-72 yrs old) who survived breast cancer could be corroborated by their husbands was examined. Because the breast cancer experience is an equally stressful event for husbands and may present an opportunity for growth, the degree to which the husbands' reports of posttraumatic growth could be corroborated by their wives also was examined. Moderate positive correlations provided intersubjective validation of individuals' perceptions of posttraumatic growth. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study examined the effects of 3 sources of perceived social support and 4 coping strategies on measures of negative affect among 44 hospitalized and nonhospitalized women (aged 39-75 yrs old) with breast or gynecological cancer undergoing radiation therapy. The results showed different patterns of relations between the variables in the 2 groups of patients. Among hospitalized patients, support from medical staff and family and problem-oriented coping were the most significant predictors of negative affect. Among nonhospitalized patients, the most significant predictors of negative affect were family support, physical isolation/suppression of emotions, and avoidance coping. The results concerning the relationship between social support and coping strategies among hospitalized patients showed that support from medical staff was a positive predictor of problem-oriented coping, whereas friends' support was a negative predictor of physical isolation/suppression of emotions among nonhospitalized patients. Although the hypothesis of social support as coping assistance was confirmed to some extent, the results suggest that social support does not exert its effects of reducing negative affect predominantly through coping strategies; its effects are direct.

AB- The aim of this study was to describe, by means of explorative interviews, the experiences of relatives (mothers, fathers, and wives) of male family members (aged 22-45 yrs old) suffering from testicular cancer. The central questions concerned how the disease and its treatment affected the life of the family, how its daily routines were affected, the form of relationships and closeness during the period of the disease, and how the future was given shape. The results revealed four main themes presented by the relatives during the interviews: the disease and its course, normalization, the long-term consequences of the disease, and the social network. The results showed that relatives of men suffering from cancer live in a vulnerable situation characterized by social isolation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Numerous studies have examined the psychosocial effects of childhood cancer on teenage and young adult survivors. Yet, there is relatively little research on the consequences of survivorship for the parents of these people. This study explored the realities of life for mothers of survivors of childhood cancer. Data from self-report questionnaires with 167 mothers of survivors and follow-up intensive interviews with 29 of them were analyzed. Findings indicated that mothers' worries were not so much a function of "objective" physical consequences of their child's illness. Instead, their worries were significantly related primarily to their own perceptions of their child's worries and the meanings they attached to their own and their child's cancer experience. The implications of the results for intervention with survivors of childhood cancer and their families include hospital-organized information and education programs; supportive counseling; meetings with other parents; and, for parents whose children have actual limitations, supportive rehabilitation services.

AB- Men diagnosed with prostate cancer must make decisions about medical treatment in a context of high uncertainty. However, when making decisions about treatment, many men prefer to defer decision-making responsibility to their physician. An exploratory study investigated the effect of varying ambiguity and risk and relevant psychological and sociodemographic variables on men's desire for involvement in decision making in a hypothetical treatment scenario. A self-report questionnaire was administered by mail to a community sample of 705 men (aged 26-83 yrs) who were part of an ongoing study into men's health. In addition, the men were randomly allocated to four experimental groups for a 2×2 manipulation of high and low ambiguity with high and low risk for one of four scenarios for choices of treatment. Varying risk and ambiguity did not affect men's desire for involvement in decision making. Deferral of decision-making responsibility to the physician was predicted by high powerful others, low internal locus of control, a preference for black-and-white thinking, and lower levels of education. The results provided preliminary support for the conceptualization of deferral of decision-making responsibility to the physician as a shortcut--the expert-opinion heuristic.

Watson et al, 1988) and the 36-item Health Survey. Men in the support group endorsed a coping style of anxious preoccupation and a coping style with low helplessness and hopelessness and high fighting spirit. The Health Survey measured no significant difference in quality of life. Only 3% of the controls reported that they would have attended a support group if they had known about it. 40% said they would not attend, and 57% were not sure.

AB- Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) traditionally has been withheld from women with breast cancer to minimize their risk of recurrence. However, the benefits of HRT include relief from menopausal symptoms and protection against osteoporosis and possibly heart disease. Focus groups were conducted among 30 women (aged 36-75 yrs) diagnosed with breast cancer to explore how the women approached health decisions, especially regarding HRT, and to identify factors that influenced their decision-making process. Factors identified included relief of symptoms, fear of cancer, side effects of treatment, attitudes toward risk, perception of risk and mastery, and physicians' recommendations. The article discusses these factors and provides suggestions, such as the following, to care providers who counsel women concerning menopause and HRT: Help patients understand areas in which the evidence is solid, address their possibly unrealistic expectations, and help them articulate their feelings and fears.

AB- Two cost-effective one-day workshops presenting either problem-focused or emotion-focused coping strategies for women completing treatment for breast cancer were evaluated for their impact on three robust patterns of coping resulting from a previous factor analysis. A factor analysis was carried out on the Ways of Coping Questionnaire using a sample of 250 patients (mean age 55 yrs) six months after diagnosis. Three factors were found: positive problem solving, escape/avoidance, and seeking social support. These factors were used as dependent variables in a study on the effects of two brief, psychoeducational workshop interventions on coping among 156 women (mean age 51.8 yrs) completing treatment for breast cancer. The women were randomized to either a problem-focused or emotion-focused coping workshop or to a waiting-list. The results indicated that women who were positive problem solvers made gains in this pattern of coping if they participated in the problem-focused workshop, whereas women in the emotion-focused workshop showed a trend to reduce their use of escape/avoidance. The coping pattern of seeking social support was unchanged by either intervention. The workshops were well accepted and cost-effective. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This article identifies differences in mammography-related perceptions between African Americans and Caucasians of differing educational levels and racial differences in beliefs across stages of adoption of mammography among 1,336 women (mean age 66 yrs). African Americans perceived stronger benefits of and lower barriers to mammography and greater self-efficacy regarding mammography than Caucasians did but had less knowledge about breast cancer and stronger cancer fatalism. Within races, the less well-educated women displayed less knowledge and more fatalism. Of seven perceptions, five differed by stage of adopting mammography among Caucasians and three differed by stage among African Americans. For both races, precontemplators had the lowest self-efficacy and knowledge and the highest barriers. However, whereas Caucasian precontemplators perceived the lowest benefits, African-American precontemplators had the highest benefit scores.

AB- This investigation explored the links between coping and psychological outcomes among 57 survivors (mean age 72.40 yrs) of prostate cancer who had been treated with radiation. Analyses revealed that the associations between coping and two outcomes, psychological distress and marital satisfaction, depended on the supportive context in which survivors were coping. Direct associations were observed between perceived support and the use of problem-focused and support-seeking strategies, whereas inverse associations emerged with self-blame, wishful thinking, and avoidance. The association between seeking support and marital satisfaction was strong and positive for men with high perceptions of support but was fairly weak and negative for men with low perceptions of support. Similarly, a high positive correlation emerged between wishful thinking and marital dissatisfaction for men with low perceived support, but a low negative correlation was observed between these variables for men with high perceived support.

AB- Examined demographic, clinical, and psychosocial correlates of adjustment among a sample of cancer survivors (83 females and 26 males, mean age 60.3 yrs). Analyses concerning demographic and clinical variables indicated that being married, having a high income and level of education, and a positive perception of one's health was related to higher levels of adjustment; female survivors and survivors of breast cancer (versus prostate cancer) also reported higher levels of sexual adjustment. Analyses concerning psychosocial predictors of adjustment indicated that survivors who reported higher levels of social support, optimism, and meaning in life, and lower levels of avoidant-type coping exhibited better adjustment. A prediction model of adjustment indicated strong empirical support for a model depicting higher psychosocial adjustment as a function of higher levels of social support and meaning in life and lower levels of avoidant-type coping behaviors. Overall, the findings offer important information for understanding variables associated with adaptation to a cancer diagnosis and provide support for the usefulness of clinical services for survivors that provide social support, minimize the use of avoidant-type coping and help them attain a sense of meaning from their illness.

AB- This study investigated the psychosocial adjustment of 80 school-age children (34 males and 46 females, aged 8-16 yrs) during the first year of a parent's cancer diagnosis. Based on a cognitive model of stress and coping, the aims were to consider within-group variability in children's responses and to identify the strongest factors associated with good or poor adjustment. Mixed methods of data collection (standardized measures and semistructured interviews) were used to facilitate a more sensitive and reliable assessment of the children's experiences. The study was innovative in triangulating the sources of outcome measures and thus obtained self-reported data as well as assessments from parents and teachers. After multivariate analysis, the two main risk factors shown to be independently associated with poor adjustment in children were low self-esteem (p = .002) and poor adjustment in the parent with cancer (p = .01).

AB- Solution-focused brief therapy is proposed as a viable approach to working with families that are experiencing and dealing with the impact of cancer on their lives. The authors provide a brief outline of the structure of solution-focused work and a case example (a middle-aged woman) to illustrate some issues related to the model. They express caution about the use of the "miracle question" with cancer patients and their families and offer suggestions for reformulating or rewording the miracle question.

KP- motivations to & stress & satisfaction from working in peer-led oncology support service
KP- volunteers
SU- Motivation; Neoplasms; Satisfaction; Stress; Support Groups
AB- Notes that peer-led oncology support services are increasingly important as accessible and affordable adjuncts to medical care. Volunteers involved in these programs frequently have experienced cancer, either their own diagnosis or a family member's. This descriptive study explored the motivations, stress, and satisfaction of 85 18–82 yr old volunteers working in such a service. Using a framework developed by A. Omoto and M. Snyder, which identified 3 stages of the volunteer dynamic—the antecedents, experiences, and consequences—this study identified details about volunteers' motivations, their satisfactions, their relationship with the organization, and the effects of the work on them. Differences in motivations and stress were found between volunteers who had had a cancer diagnosis and those who had not. There was a high level of satisfaction and volunteer continuity, although the more veteran volunteers tended to be less satisfied. Key implications include the importance of a supportive work environment that satisfies motivations and attends to needs of the volunteer as well as the clientele. The authors offer suggestions for organizational structures that can promote volunteer continuity and thus effective provision of service. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Explored the issues of personality and knowledge of bone marrow typing in 66 students who participated in a bone marrow typing drive and 47 nonparticipants (all Ss mean age 23 yrs). No differences in personality between the donors and nondonors were found on measures of perceived self-competence, satisfaction with life, and overall fear of medical procedures. However, donors reported greater concern with social desirability and less fear of needles than did nondonors who were aware of the drive. Students who were better educated about the donation procedure were more likely to donate, as were students who had previously donated blood. Nondonors were more likely to identify incorrectly the means by which marrow is typed and to believe that the process is painful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Notes that adolescent daughters of women who are ill have been identified in several studies as the most distressed of all children with an ill parent. Bowlby's attachment theory holds that dependency is a healthy adaptive response at times of significant stress. Although peer support is important during adolescence, a review of research supports the notion that parents play a vital role in helping adolescents at risk. Attachment may be particularly important for girls, Attachment theory, in a context of female psychological development, suggests dyadic or family focused intervention strategies as well as peer support for adolescent daughters of women with cancer. Implications for practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Explored whether social support, depression, and personal characteristics (age, gender, and stage of treatment) were main effects on hopelessness among 113 cancer patients (aged 26–77 yrs) in 3 phases of the illness: newly diagnosed, adjuvant chemotherapy, and recurrence. The instruments used were the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Support, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale. The patients were being treated at an oncological medical center in northern Israel. The main findings indicate a strong correlation between hopelessness and depression. Multiple regression analyses, using hopelessness as a dependent variable and social support, illness phase, gender, and age as independent variables, indicate that patients with a high level of social support felt less of a sense of hopelessness. Phase of the illness had no effect on hopelessness. Additional findings indicate that the older the patient, the less his or her feeling of hopelessness.

Sections in the article focus on (1) improving and expanding financial referrals, (2) increasing accommodation to financial stress and improving mental health, (3) encouraging patients' compliance with care, and (4) providing recommendations for clinicians. The author concludes by recommending 3 financial interventions for gradual biopsychosocial improvement: (1) expand the scope of financial referrals, (2) focus on enhancing patients' accommodation, adaptation, coping, and compliance with care when improvement in the level of financial stress appears to be limited, and (3) educate elderly patients about cost-saving measures that may reduce their financial worries about the burden of future health care needs.

AB- Cancer patients' ability to cope with disease- and treatment-related symptoms depends in part on their internal resources. This study examined the impact of a structured nursing intervention on coping resources. Nurses visited 48 patients (mean age 49.08 yrs) treated with chemotherapy, radiation, or both at their homes biweekly for approximately 3 months. The nurses were trained to assess the patients' symptoms and well-being; advise, guide, support, and educate them; and transfer responsibility for symptom control to them according to the self-care model. The assessments of the patients and a matched control group also included a measure of patients' perception of the intensity of their symptoms, independence, familial support, and knowledge needed for symptom control. The intervention patients' scores on a sense of coherence measure indicated significant improvement in all 3 subcategories (comprehensibility, manageability, meaningfulness), and their focus of control became significantly more internal. These results were associated with reduced intensity of symptoms and increased independence, familial support, and knowledge. The findings strongly suggest that the self care approach improves patients' coping abilities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The majority of studies on the relationship between cancer and well-being have been conducted in the US and other Western countries. Consequently, a bias might exist that ignores the influence of cultural factors on perceptions of cancer, its etiology, and treatment. This investigation, a pilot study using African languages, attempted to explore the impacts of culture on health-related quality of life by using D. F. Celia's FACT-G scales to study 167 rural Zulu, Pedi, and Tswana patients (mean age 47.3 yrs) of extremely low socioeconomic status. Results suggest that cultural factors may exert a significant influence on the experience of FACT-G measured quality-of-life issues for cancer patients. Specifically, cultural attitudes toward accepting fate, a high level of trust and deference to healers, and a highly collectivistic orientation surrounding treatment decisions and procedures may have had an impact on the patient's scores on all four FACT-G subscales.

AB- African American women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than White women but are more likely to be adversely affected. However, little attention has been paid to how these women cope with the disease or whether they differ from White women in coping with breast cancer. Using a comparative design, this study analyzed the differences in coping strategies and use of social support between African American and White women with breast cancer. 102 women (aged 27–91 yrs) with breast cancer completed measures of coping behavior and social support. Findings suggest that both groups tend to seek social support as a way of coping with their breast cancer but differ in their sources of support. Social workers are urged to consider that there may he differences in sources of social support between racially and ethnically diverse populations. These differences may have an impact on the type of support provided and therefore on patients' need for service. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Questionnaires were administered to 234 patients (mean age 67.7 yrs) with prostate cancer to determine their sources of emotional, informational, and practical support and the relationship between their satisfaction with this support and their self-reports of coping and quality of life. 142 of the respondents attended support groups, 92 did not. Attenders were significantly more likely to cite other patients as sources of all three types of support. Furthermore, attenders cited fellow patients as their most helpful source of informational support, whereas nonattenders cited medical staff. Satisfaction with social support was significantly correlated with coping and quality of life. No significant differences were found between attenders and nonattenders regarding coping, quality of life, or satisfaction with the three types of support. The results are interpreted according to individual differences in how the patients satisfied their needs for support. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- personality & subjective well-being after surgery
KP- Ss with colorectal cancer
SU- Colon Disorders; Neoplasms; Personality Correlates; Surgery; Well Being
AB- The present study examined the relationship between a general personality framework (the five-factor model) and subjective well-being in patients with colorectal cancer. Participants were 56 postsurgical patients with colorectal cancer who completed a mailed, self-administered questionnaire that assessed demographic characteristics, personality, and subjective well-being (life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect, and affect balance). Pearson correlations indicated that neuroticism had the highest correlation with life satisfaction, affect balance, and negative affect, whereas extroversion had the highest correlation with positive affect. Moreover, hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that personality explained an additional 20% to 29% of the variance in subjective well-being after important demographic and medical variables were controlled for. The authors concluded that personality, particularly neuroticism, is strongly related to subjective well-being in patients with colorectal cancer and that clinicians should be aware of its implications for patients' functioning.

KP- quality of life
KP- 24–82 yr old leukemia & lymphoma survivors
SU- Leukemias; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Survivors
AB- This study examined quality of life among 53 long-term survivors (aged 24–82 yrs) of leukemia and lymphoma. Analyses of data collected from a standardized instrument designed specifically for cancer survivors and from in-depth face-to-face interviews suggest that long-term survivors experience positive outcomes as a result of their cancer experience along with long-term physical and psychosocial sequelae. The author concludes that quality-of-life outcomes partially may be a function of the cognitive frame or meaning that survivors attribute to their experience. Ensuring adequate care and attention to the needs of long-term survivors requires an understanding of the effects of disease on quality of life as well as the varied ways in which long-term survivors adapt and live the remainder of their lives.

AB- This article explores interest in a support group among 218 individuals (aged 18–82 yrs) tested for a mutation in BRCA1, a breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene. When queried 4 to 7 months after receiving the BRCA1 test results, approximately one-fourth of the participants expressed interest in a hypothetical support group. A mixed-carrier status and multiple family group was preferred over a carrier-only and single family group. The information about interest in a support group among individuals test for a BRCA1 mutation represents an important step in identifying those who are most receptive to psychosocial interventions.

SU- Group Psychotherapy; Neoplasms; Psychoeducation; Supportive Psychotherapy; Treatment Outcomes
AB- Reviews the psychological outcomes of studies that evaluated group interventions using a predominantly supportive or psychoeducational approach as well as studies that made direct comparisons between the two approaches. Studies were identified via a computerized CD-ROM search on MedLine, Psych Lit, HealthStar, Current Contents and CINAHL. Criteria for inclusion in the review were group psychological intervention with adult cancer patients, use of psychometrically validated instruments, randomized or case-controlled design, and publication in English since 1960. 15 studies were found to be acceptable. Results show the majority of findings suggest that patients who attend psychoeducational groups experience greater benefits than do those who attend purely supportive groups. However, the authors state that further well-designed research in this area is needed to identify specific patient cohorts that are most likely to benefit from each approach (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Adjustment; Human Females; Neoplasms; Significant Others; Social Support
AB- Examined the role of the primary partnered relationship as a factor in women's adjustment to cancer. Ss consisted of 40 women (aged 27–48 yrs) that were (1) currently receiving some form of treatment for cancer, (2) had been diagnosed at least 2 mo, but not more than 2 yrs, before the study, (3) were the mother of at least 1 child aged 12 yrs or younger and (4) were currently involved in a primary partnered relationship. Data from semistructured interviews (regarding partners' support and its impact on the primary partnered relationship) and the Mutual Psychological Development Questionnaire (measuring the mutuality of the primary partner relationship, including shared feelings, thoughts, and activity between people in relationships) were used to determine (1) how women with cancer perceive the effect of their illness on their primary partnered relationship, (2) what types of support women receive from their partners during the illness experience, (3) if this support is adequate and (4) the relationship between the mutuality of the primary partner relationship and the support given by the partner. Results indicate that the type of support the partner provides as well as the mutuality of the relationship contribute positively to women's coping.

AB- Reviews literature on interventions that have been developed to help cancer patients' partners through a focus on counseling for couples, counseling for partners and family counseling. The authors conclude that, although interventions targeted at partners of cancer patients have led to improved communication between partners and patients, much more work must be done to develop programs that specifically target the areas in which partners experience the most difficulty. Further, although problem-solving and educational interventions can be useful, interventions that target partners' support and existential needs and foster open communication between partners and patients are likely to prove most effective in alleviating distress in both partner and patient. Suggestions for providing interventions tailored specifically for different populations of partners are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Health; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Survivors; Testes
AB- Retrospectively studied 277 survivors of testicular cancer (aged 18–83 yrs) to determine health-related quality of life 3–13 yrs after treatment. A packet of questionnaires were mailed to Ss. Questionnaires included were: (1) the Swedish Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire, (2) a questionnaire consisting of 18 specific questions or statement concerning the testicular cancer, and (3) The Gothenburg Quality of Life Instrument. Results were compared with an age-matched group of 122 men in the general population. Results show, overall, the health-related quality of life experienced by the survivors is as good as, or even better than, that of the men in the general population. However, men treated with chemotherapy, either as a single therapy or in combination with other treatments, did score less favorably regarding quality of life. Perceived attractiveness, being fertile, having children and living with a partner are concluded to be the most important aspects of good health-related quality of life.

SU- Adjustment; Coping Behavior; Neoplasms; Stress; Threat
AB- Measured and described appraisals of threat among children with cancer through the development of the Threat Appraisal Questionnaire (TAQ), designed to assess threat to self, threat to others, threat of loss, and threat of physical harm to self. Ss consisted of 14 girls and 26 boys (aged 8–19 yrs) and their primary caregivers. Children were asked to complete the measure in response to a medically-related event, a peer-related event, and a family-related event. Additional measures included (1) demographic data, as provided by the primary caregiver; (2) severity of illness, as assessed by a physician's rating on the Karnofsky Performance Scale; (3) the Children's Hope Scale (CHS), completed by child Ss; and (4) the Personal Adjustment and Role Skills Scale III, completed by caregivers to assess the child's competence and overall psychosocial adjustment. The TAQ and CHS were read aloud to the children by the interviewer. Results indicate that the children's ratings of the 4 types of threat vary with the context of the stressful event. The authors maintain that findings provide initial support for a direct relationship between specific dimensions of threat and measures of adjustment.

KP- empowerment perspective on use of music therapy as part of collaborative medicine approach to promotion of healing
KP- oncology patients
SU- Empowerment; Interdisciplinary Treatment Approach; Music Therapy; Neoplasms; Treatment
AB- This article is about healing in the context of the oncology hospital setting. It suggests the benefits of collaborative medicine and its enhancement through music therapy. An empowerment perspective guides its emphasis on the necessity of meeting the psychosocial needs of patients, encouraging participation in treatment, and facilitating a psychologically positive hospital experience through the application of music. A review of the literature and an outline of the specific physical and psychological benefits of music in oncology treatment are provided. The authors argue that psychological symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, which are commonly experienced by long-term hospital patients, can be prevented when oncology care teams follow a philosophy of healing the whole person rather than merely treating an illness. They suggest that researchers and care teams further explore the development of creative arts programs in hospital settings.

KP- impact of diagnosis & coping & adjustment
KP- male vs female partners of patients diagnosed with cancer
SU- Adjustment; Coping Behavior; Medical Diagnosis; Neoplasms; Significant Others
AB- Because the importance of partners' role in determining the adjustment of patients with cancer has become increasingly evident, partners have become the target of studies more extensively in recent years. In addition, partners often suffer more psychological distress from the impact of the diagnosis than patients do. This 2-part review identifies 3 areas of research that have not been integrated in the literature: (1) the impact of cancer on the partner across different stages of the illness trajectory, (2) gender differences in partners' reactions and adjustment, and (3) psychosocial interventions for partners. Part 1 focuses on the experience of cancer patients' partners, how the illness affects them, and how they adjust to and cope with the illness. Part 2 reviews the interventions that have been developed to help patients' partners and concludes with suggestions for providing interventions specifically tailored for different populations of partners.

SU- Adjustment; Breast Neoplasms; Coping Behavior; God Concepts; Religiosity
AB- Explored the role of religious resources in long-term adjustment to breast cancer.32 female survivors (aged 39–67 yrs) were assessed on indexes of religious resources (e.g., God image), nonreligious resources (e.g., optimism), and emotional and spiritual well-being. Results indicated that both relationship with God, or God image, and religious coping behavior were related to the survivors' well-being. However, the relationship of these resources with well-being and other nonreligious resources was complex. Different types of relationship with God (e.g., presence) and religious coping behavior (e.g., religious discontent) demonstrated different associations with aspects of emotional well-being and nonreligious resources (e.g., optimism). For example, women who had a sense of a benevolent God experienced less psychological distress in their current life situation. Finally, religious resources, in general, added to the prediction of emotional well-being for the long-term survivors beyond the contribution of nonreligious resources.

KP- African-American 15–57 yr olds
SU- Genetics; Health Attitudes; Health Screening; Neoplasms; Predisposition
AB- Identification of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 offers individuals at high risk for breast, ovarian, colon, or prostate cancer the opportunity to learn if they are genetically predisposed to these diseases. The Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago Medical Center has a program that provides genetic testing for people with a family history of these cancers. However, African Americans do not participate in genetic testing at the same rate European Americans do. Thus, focus groups were conducted to learn more about the factors influencing the participation of African Americans in genetic testing. Ss included 21 African-American males and females aged 15–57 yrs. The findings indicated that several factors influence their participation, including perceptions about cancer survivability and lack of awareness about the role of genetic testing. The article discusses these factors and provides specific recommendations for improving African Americans' access and response to genetic testing.

KP- development of Reunion Day workshop for needs assessment & support

SU- Health Care Delivery; Health Service Needs; Needs Assessment; Neoplasms; Support Groups
AB- Describes a workshop called "Reunion Day," instituted in 1990 for survivors of pediatric cancer and their families. The objectives of the program were as follows: to provide a supportive forum for former patients and their families to discuss posttreatment experiences, to examine quality of life after cancer treatment, and to assess the former patients' needs by collecting information from them and their parents that would guide the development and expansion of a Pediatric Long-Term Follow-Up Program. 40 former patients (mean age 24.6 yrs) and 44 family members participated. It is suggested that the Reunion Day format can serve as a practical, cost-effective opportunity to conduct a preliminary assessment of survivors' needs while providing a useful service to them at the same time.

SU- Emotional Adjustment; Health Attitudes; Neoplasms; Psychosocial Factors; Risk Perception
AB- Explored the psychosocial morbidity and health concerns accompanying individuals' perceived increased risk of cancer. In a Familial Cancer Program, 78 patients (aged 18–71 yrs) were divided into 2 groups: 39 with and 39 without a cancer diagnosis. Questionnaires completed in the clinic before a risk evaluation included the Trait Anxiety Scale, the Medical Outcome Study Questionnaire, the Bipolar Profile of Mood States (POMS-BI), and an investigator-designed open-ended questions reviewed by a panel of experts. Patients' perception of a high lifetime risk ranged from 16% to 88%. A favorable median global mood score was found on the POMS-BI, whereas a distress-specific question revealed an increased level of stress caused by the person's cancer risk. Trait anxiety correlated significantly with most health and psychosocial variables. Patients identified emotional and family concerns and their uncertain situation most often as being difficult in dealing with their risk, and they identified information, support, and screening most often as being helpful.

AB- Investigated the psychosocial sequelae of radiotherapy and chemotherapy for primary breast cancer. Negative ,and positive affect and functional impairment were measured at 5 intervals between pretreatment and 3 mo after treatment in 78 patients with primary breast cancer (aged 30–70 yrs) who were undergoing radio- or chemotherapy. The radiotherapy patients' negative affect was greatest when therapy began and declined during therapy, whereas chemotherapy patients' negative affect increased during therapy and lasted up to 1 mo after therapy ended. The patients' functional, recreational, and home management activities were disrupted, predominantly during the first half of the treatment regimen and their sleep and rest behaviors became more disrupted as they progressed through the course of treatment. The chemotherapy patients' social interactions and alertness declined significantly during therapy. The results suggest that psychoeducational interventions would be advantageous before radiotherapy begins and at discrete intervals during and after chemotherapy.

KP- biopsychosocial perspective on prostate cancer
SU- Biopsychosocial Approach; Neoplasms; Prostate
AB- The impact of prostate cancer is described from a biopsychosocial perspective. Illness-related demands or stressors, such as symptoms, side effects, and overall life disruption related to diagnosis, staging, monitoring, and treatments are addressed. Although a dearth of psychosocial research exists in this field, there are indications that the sexual sphere—apart from urinary functioning—is primarily affected. Although impotence, urinary obstruction, and incontinence are among the most common complaints from early stage disease on, no statistics have appeared about the prevalence of psychological morbidity. The authors derive salient issues from available evidence; discuss implications for practice, such as the role of and need for psychosocial interventions (e.g., psychoeducation and coping-skills training); and note that age-specific factors may influence the impact of stress associated with the disease.

As they begin fieldwork, students experience a variety of stresses as they are challenged to grow professionally. This Study examined, from 15 students' (aged 23–50 yrs) perspectives, experiences related to 2nd-yr field placement in an oncology setting. The study identified the factors considered to be difficult and demanding as well as helpful in the students' overall adjustment to the setting. The authors discuss the implications for field instructors in oncology social work and offer recommendations for graduate students choosing this specialized area of practice.

AB- Described the development and analyzed the validity of the Cancer Worries Inventory (CWI), which measures the illness-related cognitive concerns or worries of cancer patients. The CWI, containing 60 Likert-like items and 1 open-ended item, was completed by 185 cancer patients (aged 18+ yrs), who also completed 1 of 4 other measures: the Profile of Mood States–Short Form, the Stanford Inventory of Cancer Patient Adjustment, the Revised Impact of Event Scale, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale–General. Factor analysis resulted in a shortened, 24-item CWI that contained 5 factors (death and dying, burden, spirituality, chemotherapy, and treatment) and demonstrated good internal consistencies. Construct validity was evidenced by significant inverse relationships with positive mood, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, quality of life, and intrusive thoughts and by a significant positive relationship with 5 measures of negative mood.

SU- Client Attitudes; Health; Needs; Neoplasms; Psychosocial Factors
AB- Examined the prevalence and intensity of psychosocial and health needs identified by outpatients attending a melanoma clinic. 179 Ss (aged 18–86 yrs) completed the Cancer Needs Questionnaire (G. Foot, 1996; G. Foot and R. Sanson-Fisher, 1995). The questionnaire includes items pertaining to 5 categories of needs: psychological, health information, physical and daily living, patient care and support, and interpersonal communication. 12 melanoma-specific items also were included. The prevalence of individual needs ranged from 14% to 43%, and 6 of the 10 highest-ranked needs concerned health information. Ss' demographic and disease and treatment variables were related to needs within each category. Results show that unmet needs for information persist in this sample of Ss with melanoma. Needs in other domains, such as psychological concerns and problems with health care providers, also were identified in addition to disease-specific needs. The results suggest that more research is needed to measure patients' needs routinely, to identify patient groups with specific needs, and to develop methods to meet their needs effectively.

AB- Focuses on psychotherapeutic interventions specific to women with breast cancer that were published between 1995 and 1998. Following a brief synopsis of psychotherapeutic interventions for women with breast cancer published between 1974 and 1994, the author highlights what is known and elucidates knowledge gaps in the literature. The author suggests that more information about who is best prepared to provide psychotherapeutic care is needed. The author recommends that there needs to be more specific information about therapeutic interventions that are appropriate for each stage of the disease. In addition, identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from specialized interventions will enable clinicians to screen more effectively. By crystallizing the focus of scholarly inquiries about therapeutic research on breast cancer since 1994 and by addressing the most salient methodological issues and knowledge gaps, the article addresses the need to identify the treatment modalities most likely to provide the greatest potential for use by clinicians and facilitates the application of research to practice.

AB- The Breast Health Center at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center in Israel provides medical and psychosocial services under 1 roof. The authors describe a model developed for the special needs of Israeli patients with breast cancer. The overall purpose of this intervention model is to offer a comprehensive supportive program to this particular population of women who are currently in a crucial and highly stressful period in their lives. The model is based on the crisis intervention approach (D. C. Aguilera, 1990). The model includes 3 phases of psychosocial intervention: diagnostic, surgical/hospitalization, and recovery. The underlying assumption is that each phase is characterized by specific stressors, each requiring distinctive adjustment and coping mechanisms. The phasic approach enables the therapist to meet the various needs of the patients. This model has been used for 5 yrs with 600 women at the Breast Health Center. The author reports favorable responses from both patients and staff. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reports a descriptive study on the quality of life and psychosocial concerns of 117 African-American women (mean age 61.8 yrs) who were long-term survivors of breast cancer. Ss completed a questionnaire consisting of standard measures of quality of life, a measure of socioecological context, and new items generated by earlier qualitative research. The questionnaire also included sections on the following: demographic characteristics, breast cancer and other medical conditions, perceived quality of health care, health beliefs, social support, life stress, living situation, health perceptions, partner support; dating, body image, spirituality; and physical, psychological, sexual, and marital functioning. Results showed that the women relied on spiritual faith and family support to cope with their cancer. However, they also reported difficulty talking about the disease on the one hand and lack of adequate emotional and functional support on the other. The results also suggested that the socioecological and cultural contexts of the women's lives may need closer examination when examining health-related quality of life outcomes after cancer.

AB- Although establishing sexual relationships is viewed as an important developmental milestone for adults, sexual functioning has been a neglected area of investigation for survivors of gynecological cancer. This article describes the long-term effects of clear-cell adenocarcinoma, with a specific focus on sexual functioning as a major quality-of-life concern and emotional adjustment of 220 women (mean age 40.6 yrs). The authors hypothesized that Ss with multiple factors that interfered with their sexual functioning would report greater sexual dysfunction, poorer adjustment, and relationship difficulties. Two additional goals were to describe late psychological effects, such as depressive symptoms, and to explore the relationship between health status, coping behavior, social support variables, and depressive symptoms. The findings provide preliminary support for a complex relationship between medical complications, sexual dysfunction, emotional adjustment, and marital/partner relationships: 38% of the Ss reported physical and psychosexual factors interfering with their sexual functioning. Although chronic sexual dysfunction is a legitimate concern by itself, the findings also suggest that sexual difficulties are associated with diverse problems involving mood, quality of life, and adjustment.

KP- correlates of anxiety
KP- 22–57 yr old daughters caring for an elderly parent receiving outpatient cancer treatment
SU- Anxiety; Caregiver Burden; Caregivers; Daughters; Neoplasms
AB- Understanding the factors that increase adult caregiving daughters' vulnerability to poor psychological functioning and thereby threaten their ability to provide adequate informal support and assistance is important to maintaining the chronically ill elderly in the community. On the basis of data obtained from 164 elderly outpatients (aged 60–90 yrs) and their adult caregiving daughters (aged 22–57 yrs), the effect of potential predictors on the caregiving daughters state anxiety scores was estimated using hierarchical regression. The total model suggests that scores of a daughter having a health-limiting condition, a greater sense of filial obligation, and a greater caregiver burden were correlated with higher anxiety scores, whereas having a favorable attitude regarding her caregiving experience, providing care in a greater number of domains of care, and having a higher level of overall satisfaction with the help received in providing care were correlated with lower scores. These findings show the value of considering the situational factors that may constrain or facilitate caregiving when examining emotional distress among familial caregivers.

SU- Coping Behavior; Major Depression; Mother Child Relations; Neoplasms; Stress
AB- Proposed a theoretical model for explaining the potential influences on child adjustment to the complex and often painful treatment regimens required in the management of childhood cancer. The primary psychosocial factors of parental coping beliefs and behavior were explored, both directly and through their influence on family relationships, for their impact on child depression in pediatric oncology patients. The study sample included mothers and 27 children (aged 7–16 yrs) with a variety of childhood cancers, whose treatment protocols were classified as either "more aggressive" (12) or "less aggressive" (15). Results indicated that maternal confidence in coping efficacy was strongly related to the mother's use of approach coping strategies, the overall quality of the family environment, and the child's self-reported level of depression. Few significant relationships were found between demographic and disease variables and the psychological mediator and outcome variables. Parental education and financial status were found to function as personal resources for the mothers. Maternal confidence in ability to cope was found to decrease with time after diagnosis. Recommendations are made for future studies to minimize the limitations inherent in the present small sample size. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- correlates of depressive symptomatology

SU- Client Characteristics; Comorbidity; Major Depression; Neoplasms; Symptoms
AB- As more elderly people experience a cancer diagnosis and live longer, the psychological sequelae of the disease and its treatment increasingly becomes a central concern. Cancer and its treatment are likely to present significant adaptive challenges to the elderly. Knowledge of the correlates of depressive symptoms in older patients may help to identify patients who are at increased risk for co-morbid depression and to inform the development of programs and services that can help reduce depressive symptoms. Data from 169 outpatients with cancer (aged 60–86 yrs) were included in an analysis to estimate a model of patients' depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. The results of regression analyses indicated that a college degree and a lesser impact of the disease on patients' social functioning correlated with lower depression and that feeling separated or set apart from others and a wider range of negative interactions with one's support network correlated with greater depression.

SU- Adjustment; Breast Neoplasms; Relapse (Disorders); Social Support
AB- Explored the reciprocal relations between social support and adjustment following a recurrence of breast cancer. The sample was composed of 30 women (aged 34–80 yrs) who had sustained a recurrence of breast cancer. Social support, coping, and adjustment were measured through telephone interviews on 2 occasions (T1 and T2) separated by 6 mo. Emotional support from a partner and informational support from an oncologist were related to decreased physical problems over time, but were not related to psychological distress over time. Women's use of positive reinterpretation appeared to mediate these relations. Interestingly, psychological distress was related to decreased partner emotional support over time. These results suggest that it is not enough to consider how social support may influence women's adjustment; it is also important to consider how women's adjustment may shape their social support networks.

AB- The purpose of this article is to describe the interaction effects of depression burden (depressive symptoms experienced as a burdensome side effect) with a set of oncology support interventions on social support for women receiving treatment for breast cancer. A repeated measures design was used with measurement occurring at 3 points in time: T1 (baseline after adjuvant medical treatment was initiated), T2 (6–8 wks after T1), and T3 (3 mo after T2). 247 women (aged 25–82 yrs) were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 194) or control (n = 53). The treatment group consisted of women participating in 3 different, but complimentary self-help interventions. Although not significant, the data demonstrated the influence of depression burden specifically on the ability to marshall needed support resources during illness. Women with high depression burden consistently lost more network members than did women who experienced depression but did not rank it among the top 5 side effects.

AB- Empirical evidence supports the conclusion that audiotapes of patient–oncologist consultations are well received by the majority of cancer patients. Patients who have received these audiotapes report reduced psychological distress and improved satisfaction. A pilot study evaluated the impact of giving patients a choice of receiving an audiotape of their primary treatment consultation. The participants in the multicentered, randomized, controlled study were 36 patients (aged 34–79 yrs) with breast or prostate cancer. Measures of decisional role preference, anxiety, satisfaction, recall of information, and perceptions of oncologists' likability and expertise were administered before and after the consultation and 6 wks later. At follow-up, recall of information was significantly greater among patients who chose to receive the audiotape. Furthermore, the patients who, at follow-up, recalled the most information had the highest degree of satisfaction with patient–physician communication. Results suggest that the intervention is a practical, effective, and inexpensive means of enhancing patient–physician communication, facilitating recall of information, and fostering patient satisfaction.

SU- Communication Skills Training; Models; Neoplasms; Pain Management
AB- Significant pain is a problem that always compromises the individual's ability to function. Barriers to adequate pain management are complex and are reinforced by societal attitudes, which are manifested by health care professionals, patients, and caregivers alike. Unrelieved cancer pain is acutely distracting and therefore is inimical to the ability to manage the demands and problems of daily living. The Creativity, Optimism, Planning, and Expert Information (COPE) model, a systematic approach to problem-solving, provides the patient and caregiver with the opportunity to work closely with their health care providers and to learn a variety of skills that result in the management of emotions; a specified course of meaningful, focused action; and the ability to reflect on and measure progress toward physical comfort. This article reviews assessment questions that are essential to a psychosocial and behavioral approach to cancer pain and describes four case studies that illustrate how professionals can use the COPE model to structure communication and help patients (aged 50–77 yrs) solve pain-related problems.

KP- family caregivers of patients with cancer & other chronic disorders
SU- Caregivers; Chronic Illness; Computer Assisted Instruction; Health Education; Problem Solving
AB- Changes in the organization and financing of health care delivery have resulted in increasing the responsibilities of family members who care for people with cancer and other chronic diseases. These family caregivers need to develop skills in problem-solving and in preventing physical, emotional, and social crises at home. For problem-solving education to affect caregiving behavior, family caregivers need ongoing reinforcement of what they have learned about problem-solving. Such support can come from the creative use of technology, such as computer or voice bulletin boards, which offer a wide array of services that are directly available at home for health education or counseling purposes. This article describes two computer-driven sources of information and support: the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) Program and the Telepractice and COPELINE systems, which are specifically designed to reinforce problem-solving learning among family caregivers of people with cancer.

AB- This article describes a cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for teaching mothers of newly diagnosed patients with pediatric cancer to solve their problems, problems related to their child's illness, and the family's emotional reactions to the illness. The authors discuss the challenges and effects of maternal adjustment throughout the various stages of the child's illness, review the characteristics of adult learners, describe a maternal problem-solving therapy program, and provide an overview of the structured educational process, followed by a detailed discussion of a six-step maternal problem-solving therapy intervention. Finally, they describe an inventory that measures the effects of the intervention, which is being tested in a randomized controlled trial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- social problem solving & distress reactions to stressful events
KP- diagnosed cancer patients & females who underwent surgery for breast cancer
SU- Breast Neoplasms; Distress; Neoplasms; Problem Solving; Psychosocial Readjustment
AB- Social problem-solving ability has previously been found to be an important coping mechanism in predicting distress reactions to stressful events in the general population. Two studies evaluate the applicability of these findings to the psychooncology literature by assessing the relationship between distress and problem-solving in two different groups of cancer patients. In Study 1, 105 patients with recently diagnosed cancer completed inventories addressing social problem-solving, symptoms of distress, and cancer specific problems. The results indicated that the patients who were less effective problem-solvers also reported higher levels of anxiety and depression as well as more cancer-related problems. Study 2 involved 64 women who had undergone surgery for breast cancer between 1 and 13.3 years earlier. A self-report of negative life events served to control for the effects of recent stressors. The results of this study indicated that less problem-solving ability was a significant predictor of psychological distress, whereas time since surgery was not associated with cancer-related distress. Together, the two studies provide strong initial support for the existence of an important relationship between social problem-solving and cancer-related distress.

KP- cancer patients
SU- Cognitive Therapy; Mental Disorders; Neoplasms; Problem Solving
AB- Problem-solving therapy is a cognitive-behavioral intervention that has been found to be effective in the treatment of a variety of mental health problems, especially depression. The relevance of this therapy for cancer patients is addressed and is placed within the context of a problem-solving model of stress. This model argues that the likelihood that cancer patients will experience significant and long-lasting emotional difficulties and psychological distress is partially a function of their problem-solving abilities. Research supports this model not only in general but also for cancer patients in particular. A large-scale outcome study is currently underway to evaluate the efficacy of problem-solving therapy with adult cancer patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- mental adjustment to & appraisals of cancer & optimism & emotional functioning

SU- Client Attitudes; Emotional Adjustment; Neoplasms; Optimism; Prostate
AB- This study examined the interrelationships between mental adjustment to cancer (i.e., fighting spirit, helplessness, anxious preoccupation, and fatalism), optimism, appraisals (i.e., harm/loss, threat, and challenge), and emotional functioning (i.e., depression, anxiety, and self-esteem) in a small sample of men (mean age 75 yrs) with prostate cancer. Measures included the Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, the Life Orientation Test, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Various significant correlational findings were obtained, as hypothesized, and several of these results were supported further by conservative hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Specifically, these latter analyses revealed that increased helplessness was related to decreased self-esteem and that increased anxious preoccupation was related to increased depression. Loss appraisals were related to increased depression and threat appraisals were related to increased anxiety. Finally, optimism was negatively related to increases in both depression and anxiety. The findings are discussed within the framework of previous research and the relevance of psychosocial variables to the well-being of patients with prostate cancer.

AB- The increased efficacy of cancer treatments has resulted in greater numbers of older adults who survive cancer. This study examined the psychological well-being of cancer survivors (with no evidence of disease) and their attitudes of medical skepticism toward physicians. The impact of recurrence, a family history of cancer, and physical functioning were examined. Higher levels of medical skepticism toward physicians were reported by survivors of recurrences and may reflect the intense experience of dealing with physicians over the course of two or more episodes of cancer. Because the research has implications concerning the relationship between cancer survivors and their physicians, physicians should consider the potential for medical skepticism and psychological distress among their patients who are cancer survivors.

AB- The Profile of Mood States was used to measure distress in 44 patients (aged 34–81 yrs) with breast cancer at 15 and 34 mo after the diagnosis. Marital satisfaction, measured by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale and completed by both the patients and their husbands, was found to predict change in patients' distress over time. Patients who reported that their marriage was unsatisfactory, regardless of their report of distress 15 mo after the diagnosis, were at greater risk for elevated distress in the future than were those who were satisfied with their marriage. The findings suggest that marital satisfaction could be used as an indicator of a patient's trajectory of distress over time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Although Black women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than are White women, they are more likely to be adversely affected. However, little attention has been paid to how these women cope with the disease or whether Black and White women differ in their beliefs regarding control of breast cancer. Using a comparative design, this study analyzed the differences in health locus of control between 41 Black (aged 38–87 yrs) and 61 White women (aged 27–91 yrs) with breast cancer. The findings suggest that the health locus of control among women in both groups tends to be external. They attributed control of their breast cancer to their physicians, to other people, and to chance to a greater extent than to their own control. The findings point to the importance of assessing women with breast cancer for feelings of powerlessness and providing interventions that help them gain a sense of control regarding treatment decisions and prognosis.

AB- Evidence suggests that younger women who are diagnosed with breast cancer may be at increased risk for poor psychosocial outcomes. However, only limited work has examined the adaptational challenges these younger women confront. As part of a study examining decision-making about pregnancy after breast cancer, 51 women participated in unstructured interviews. The focus of the present thematic analysis was a group of 34 women who were younger than 36 years (M = 30.6 years). These women spoke of the unique issues associated with being a young woman diagnosed with breast cancer. The predominant stressors they described included (1) coping with the untimeliness of the diagnosis, (2) concerns about the impact of the illness on their husbands, (3) sadness about lost opportunities for childbearing, (4) a feeling of being different and isolated, (5) uncertainty about their future, and (6) concerns about their children. Evidence of altered belief systems about themselves and the world ran through their narratives concerning the adaptive challenges their illness posed for them.

KP- communicating the diagnosis of cancer to patients
SU- Communication; Neoplasms; Physicians; Terminally Ill Patients; Therapeutic Processes
AB- How to tell patients they have cancer is an important question in cancer care. The question provokes distress in physicians, and a failure in relating the diagnosis may arrest patients' process of coping with anxiety and reduce their subjective well-being. This contribution to a theory of communicating about the diagnosis is empirically based on an earlier study in which patients with malignant brain tumors were interviewed and is theoretically based on contemporary object-relational psychoanalysis. The authors propose that a beneficial physician–patient encounter can be viewed as characterized by the acknowledgement of the physician as an unconscious protection against death and as a facilitating environment for the patient's reconstructive process. The implications of these propositions are discussed. The authors also propose that the transference from the child–parent relationship to the patient–physician relationship enables physicians to use introspection as a means to improve their skillfulness regarding "How to tell." Thus, introspection may provide physicians with guiding knowledge grounded in themselves. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- stress responses & symptoms of anxiety & depression

SU- Anxiety; Major Depression; Neoplasms; Spouses; Stress Reactions
AB- The relationship between husbands' and wives' individual stress responses (intrusive thoughts and avoidance) and symptoms of anxiety and depression was examined shortly after diagnosis in a sample of 58 patients (aged 29–59 yrs) with cancer (43 women, 15 men) and their spouses. Marital partners' symptoms of anxiety or depression were positively correlated with one another's symptoms; however, the patients' and spouses' intrusive thoughts and avoidance were not correlated. The male patients' avoidance was positively correlated with their wives' anxiety or depression. In regression analyses, patients' avoidance uniquely predicted greater distress in both male and female patients. Male patients' avoidance also uniquely predicted greater distress in their wives. No significant interactions were found between patients' and spouses' avoidance in predicting distress in either partner. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This cross-sectional study examined the role of exercise in alleviating distress and the association between exercise and coping among women with early stage breast cancer (Stages 0-II). 71 women (mean age 57.4 yrs) diagnosed over the previous 12 months participated in assessments of mood, coping, social support, and exercise behavior. Women who exercised at criterion levels recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine were compared with those who exercised irregularly and those who were inactive. After age and stage of disease were controlled for, both exercise groups reported less confusion and higher levels of social support than the inactive group did, and the women who exercised at criterion levels reported greater vigor than did their inactive peers. Cluster analyses used to explore the relationship between coping behaviors and exercise status revealed that the inactive women were less likely than the women in the other two groups to use either behavioral coping strategies or adaptive cognitive strategies. The implications of the study include the need for further exploration of the relationship between participation in exercise and mood and coping among cancer survivors.

AB- Semistructured interviews were conducted with 26 mothers (aged 35–50 yrs) who had one or more children (N = 36) aged 8–12 years when they were diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. Formal methods were used to analyze the content of the data inductively. Mothers identified times during their diagnosis and treatment that were most difficult for their children, behaviors they observed indicating that the child was having a difficult time, and factors that prevented them from helping the child during those difficult times. The data provide a partial basis for developing materials, programs, and services designed to minimize the children's distress and to enhance the effectiveness of parenting when a mother has early stage breast cancer.

KP- self-reported worries
KP- 15–21 yr old long-term survivors of childhood cancer
SU- Anxiety; Neoplasms; Survivors
AB- Examined self-reported worries of long-term survivors (aged 15–21 yrs) of childhood cancer. Three stages of analysis were conducted. Stage 1 included a comparative analysis of long-term survivors and young people without a history of cancer. Stage 2 drew on a hospital-based sample of long-term survivors and a qualitative analysis of the open-ended comments from a panel of 20 additional survivors, to examine the reliability and validity of the results from Stage 1. Stage 3 examined factors that influenced variation in degree of worries among survivors in the first sample. A self-report questionnaire was developed to explore experiences, attitudes, and needs of the Ss. A series of 4-point Likert scale items was used to explore degree of worry. The findings suggest that in several related areas of general health and self-image, the survivors worried less than the comparison sample did. However, in areas related specifically to cancer, the survivors' degree of worry was higher than the degree reported by the comparison sample. These results are discussed in the context of the debate about the prevalence of psychopathology and psychological distress among long-term survivors of childhood cancer.

AB- Determined the proportion of childhood cancer survivors who participated in organized sports and examined demographic, medical, and health-related variables that discriminated between participants and nonparticipants. The authors surveyed 251 12–18 yr olds who were long-term survivors of childhood cancer. Ss were administered a health behavior questionnaire. A significantly greater percentage of the participant Ss had access to a local health care provider and to health insurance than did nonparticipant Ss. Ss who participated also were more likely to engage in other forms of exercise. The findings are discussed in light of interventions that promote health by targeting physical fitness and exercise for survivors of cancer and the resources necessary for them to engage in health-protective behaviors.

AB- The coping resources (i.e. psychological and social resources) and coping efforts of 21 children, 8–17 yrs old, diagnosed with cancer were assessed and were compared with standardized norms. Within-group differences were explored by subdividing Ss by stage of therapy: (1) newly diagnosed, (2) currently in treatment, and (3) off treatment. The results, using a limited sample, suggested that Ss with cancer differed significantly from typical children on measures of coping effort in that they demonstrated relatively more adaptive and efficient coping behavior than did their normative peers. These findings may well be attributed to the multitude of hospital, school, familial, and psychological supports offered to Ss. The data are analyzed and discussed with reference to mediating factors, including developmental stage, gender, stage of illness, and treatment effects.

SU- Measurement; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Oncology
AB- Used the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life (SEIQoL) with an oncology population. The SEIQoL is designed to attain a greater level of individual subjectivity in reports on quality of life than is achieved with standard measures of quality of life. The instrument's feasibility for use in oncology was assessed with a sample of 15 patients with early stage prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy. An overview of its administration, scoring, and depiction of quality of life is provided. The measure also is compared with a standard quality-of-life measure-the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). The authors suggest that the most appropriate use for the SEIQoL is as a clinical assessment tool with relatively healthy patients, whereas standard, brief measures may be more practical for use with large samples of patients or relatively unhealthy patients or when predetermined quality-of-life concerns are addressed.

SU- Major Depression; Neoplasms; Test Reliability; Test Validity
AB- Examined the psychometric performance of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in a heterogeneous sample of 453 newly diagnosed patients with cancer to determine its reliability and validity as a measure of the patients' mental health and distress. The authors implemented recent suggestions made by other researchers for evaluating instruments for use in cancer populations. The evaluation included (1) item-level reliability and validity studies, (2) a principal components analysis of hypothesized dimensions of the construct of depressive symptoms purported to be measured by the instrument, (3) a hypothesis-driven investigation of differences in subscales on concurrently measured demographic and clinical variables, and (4) an exploratory analysis of patterns of scores on the instrument. Interesting differences in gender, race, and marital status in the variation of patterns of endorsements suggested that the CES-D is sensitive to differences in how depressive symptoms present in these patients. The data supported the use of the instrument as a reliable and valid measure of depressive symptoms in recently diagnosed patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

They described 5 principal stressors associated with being an unmarried survivor of breast cancer: pessimism regarding future relationships, fears about disclosing their illness to partners, negative body image and impaired sexuality, pain of rejection by partners, and a sense of isolation and inadequate support. These findings suggest that unmarried women with breast cancer may be a vulnerable subpopulation of women with the disease who may benefit from psychosocial interventions tailored to their particular concerns.

KP- issues & perceptions related to interest in unconventional therapies
KP- survivors of cancer
SU- Adult Attitudes; Alternative Medicine; Neoplasms; Recovery (Disorders)
AB- Examined issues and perceptions related to interest in unconventional therapies in 32 survivors of cancer. Ss were interviewed concerning the motivation for seeking information about unconventional therapies, the decision-making process, the experiences with such therapies, the attempts to communicate with conventional health-care practitioners, and the perceptions of family's and friend's reactions to their interest. Results show that they had a variety of motivations for their interest. Ss consistently portrayed the mainstream cancer care system as tolerating the use of unconventional approaches while essentially remaining disengaged from the subject. Many of the Ss argued that health care professionals should be more interested in, more informed about, and more willing to discuss unconventional therapies. Ss also believed that personal experience was an important source of evidence for considering treatment options and that health care professionals often ignored this evidence, paying attention only to randomized clinical trials. In general, the Ss made a case for a better response from the health care system regarding consumers' needs concerning unconventional treatment options.

AB- The 1st part of this 2-part article reviewed the history and theoretical background of support groups and group therapies and explored the breakthroughs in mental health research showing how these groups enhance patients' quality of life. In Part 2, the author addresses issues regarding group process, group management and leadership, and the curative aspects of groups for patients with cancer. The implication of research is that support groups and group therapies help people with chronic illness and life-threatening disease to heal and possibly live longer. Social work has been ideally positioned to claim its role in having pioneered social group work at the turn of the century. By virtue of its history, values, and education, the profession provides a model for leading and co-leading groups of patients with cancer. When people are confronted with cancer, healing requires both emotional and physical assistance, and support groups can be healing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This pilot study focused on sexual functioning in patients with head and neck cancer, a subject that has received only limited attention. Thirty-six patients whose treatment had ended at least one year before the study completed the Dyadic Adjustment Scale and two questionnaires dealing with sexual functioning. A relatively high rate of refusal to participate in the study suggested sensitivity and discomfort about discussing sexual issues. At the same time, more than three-fourths of the patients who did participate rated their sex life as "somewhat" to "very important," and half reported sexual problems. The findings suggest that sexual functioning is important to patients with head and neck cancer and that the subject should be addressed although the disease site does not directly affect sexual organs.

It was found that donors had significantly more anxiety, lower self-esteem, and more adaptive skills in school than did nondonors, whereas nondonors exhibited significantly more school problems. Among the siblings, minimal explanation of the transplant procedure, loneliness and lack of attention, donors' lack of choice, and need for support groups emerged as major themes.

SU- Breast Neoplasms; Exercise; Quality of Life; Treatment
AB- This retrospective study examined the relationship between exercise during cancer treatment and current quality of life among 167 survivors of breast cancer. The women had been diagnosed within the previous two years and had completed adjuvant therapy. Each participant completed a mailed, self-administered questionnaire that assessed her exercise behavior at three points (prediagnosis, active treatment, and posttreatment); her current physical, functional, emotional, and social quality of life; and her overall satisfaction with life. The results indicated that (1) levels of exercise declined from prediagnosis to active treatment and then increased from active treatment to posttreatment, (2) exercise during active treatment was associated with a higher quality of life and with overall satisfaction with life, and (3) maintenance of exercise across the three time periods was the optimal pattern for enhanced quality of life and overall satisfaction with life. The authors concluded that  cancer treatment has a negative impact on exercise levels but that the women who maintained their exercise behavior during and after treatment reported a higher quality of life one to two years later.

AB- The authors reviewed articles published from 1960 to 1996 that focused on research on psychosocial interventions and factors that affect survival from cancer. In general, they concluded that psychosocial interventions are most effective in the early stages of disease, the strongest predictors of survival are biological, the effects of psychological factors on survival are inconsistent in early stage disease and insignificant in cases of metastatic cancer, sociodemographic variables (high socioeconomic status, private health insurance, and involvement in social networks) are positively correlated with survival, and psychosocial factors are more apparent in patients younger than 55 years.

AB- Describes the practical benefits of 33 studies evaluating the effects of psychosocial interventions on patients' adjustment to cancer. The studies were classified according to methodology: descriptive studies, retrospective and quasi-experimental studies, and controlled clinical outcome trials. The evidence suggests that psychosocial interventions have a positive impact on patients' adjustment and adaptation to cancer. No particular intervention appears to be signficantly more effective than others in helping patients deal with cancer. The methodology of different studies reveals multiple dimensions of psychosocial interventions that cannot be captured by any 1 method alone. Suggestions regarding methodological and clinical factors to consider when evaluating future psychosocial interventions for improving patients' adjustment and quality of life are offered.

AB- Assessed the acceptability of a touchscreen computer survey that assesses levels of physical side effects, anxiety, depression, and perceived needs. 229 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and hormone therapy completed the touchscreen survey while waiting to see their oncologist. After completing the computer survey, Ss completed a pen-and-paper survey indicating their reaction to the computer survey. Despite the fact that approximately 60% of the Ss had no previous experience with computers, the survey was highly acceptable to them. In addition, 96% of the Ss were happy for their oncologist to receive a summary of their results, and 89% said they would be happy to complete such a survey during each visit to the hospital.

AB- Conducted 3 forms of qualitative interviews (key-informant interviews, focus-group interviews, and in-depth interviews) in an effort to gain a better understanding of the psychosocial needs of African-American females with breast cancer. 12 informants (physicians, nurses, and administrators) who had worked in the area of cancer prevention or management for 5–25 yrs participated in the key-informant interviews. 23 38–74 yr old females participated in the focus-group interviews. Eight 38–65 yr old females participated in the in-depth interviews. It was found that most Ss receive inadequate information and support to help them through the initial diagnosis and treatment phases of the breast cancer experience. Many Ss, particularly those with less education and lower incomes, had inadequate medical insurance, received uncoordinated and incomplete medical care, and experienced a poor patient–physician relationship. A primary source of support and coping for these females was their spiritual beliefs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The requisites for a culturally competent approach to practice include the workers' ability to (1) become self-aware and recognize the influence of their own world view on their day-to-day behaviors toward African-Americans, (2) increase their knowledge about different cultures, including their own world views and those of African-American patients are likely to result in different interpretations and styles of coping, and (3) recognize and respond skillfully and effectively to the dynamics of differences. The 3 leading cancers (lung, breast, and prostate) among African-Americans are discussed and the health belief system of African-Americans is outlined.

AB- Presents Part 1 of a 2-part review of support groups and group therapies that provides a perspective on the continuum of groups for patients with cancer. This continuum includes many different types of groups, from open-ended, drop-in groups that provide supportive, educational, or self-help group experiences to time-limited or closed groups such as supportive-expressive group therapy based on the principles of existentialism. Part 1 reviews the history and theoretical background of support groups and group therapies and explores the breakthroughs in mental health research showing how these groups enhance patients' quality of life.

AB- The emotional reactions and concerns of parents of children with cancer who had different prognoses for survival were investigated. Parents (84 mothers and 79 fathers) of 84 children with cancer who were in remission or had relapsed participated in the study. The mothers and fathers of children who had relapsed reported more feelings of helplessness and uncertainty and also reported their fears more often concerning their child's chances of survival than did the mothers and fathers of children whose cancer was in remission. Mothers of children with a relapse also reported more depression and anxiety. The problems of fathers of children who had relapsed were revealed only with the use of an illness-related questionnaire. Time since diagnosis did not change the emotional reactions of any of the parents. The authors conclude that the parents of children whose cancer has relapsed should be carefully monitored.

SU- Breast Neoplasms; Pregnancy; Risk Perception
AB- Increasing numbers of women with breast cancer who have not yet had a child or want more children will be faced with deciding whether to attempt pregnancy after their treatment is completed. Through in-depth focused interviews with 50 women who completed treatment for breast cancer at least six months earlier, the perceived deterrents and incentives to having a child were explored. The principal deterrents were fears that (1) the disease would recur, (2) the child might have a birth defect caused by the chemotherapy or radiation they had received, (3) the child would be born with a susceptibility to cancer, and (4) caring for a child would be too stressful. The principal incentives were the beliefs that having a baby (1) is a cherished part of a life plan, (2) is life affirming, (3) will promote a feeling of normalcy again, (4) would make their husband very happy, and (5) would enhance their quality of life.

SU- Life Experiences; Mental Health; Neoplasms
AB- Forty-six young adult cancer patients aged 22 to 35 years were surveyed regarding life changes and specific problems they had experienced. The majority of respondents were female, college educated, and married. Although nearly three-fourths of the respondents had completed treatment and were free of symptoms, they rated anxiety about their health and recurrence of their disease as their most stressful problems. Most were worried about their children's future and risk of cancer. Other concerns were physical and financial problems and changes in their life goals. The respondents' scores on the Brief Symptom Inventory showed a moderate elevation of psychological symptoms compared with test norms. The authors concluded that young cancer patients, who have little experience with poor health and confrontation with mortality, may need more psychosocial intervention to deal with existential concerns regarding themselves and their children.

SU- Behavior Problems; Cross Cultural Differences; Neoplasms; Siblings
AB- Cross-cultural aspects of siblings' adaptation to childhood cancer were examined in 2 studies as part of a cooperative multi-institutional investigation in Israel and the US. Study 1 compared the behavioral adaptation of 35 Israeli siblings (aged 6–18 yrs) of patients (aged 2–20 yrs) with childhood cancer with 99 matched clinically referred and normal Israeli children. Study 2 compared the behavioral adaptation of case-matched samples of Israeli and American siblings and assessed the contribution of family relations and parental coping to the siblings' behavioral adjustment. Israeli siblings and normal Ss scored significantly lower on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) than the clinically referred Ss, indicating fewer behavior problems, with no differences between the siblings and normal Ss. CBCL scores of Israeli and American Ss did not differ significantly on the Externalizing and Internalizing subscales and the Total Behavior Problem score. Significant correlations were found in both the Israeli and American Ss between the parental coping and family relations variables and the CBCL summary scores, indicating that greater internal family support and emotional expressiveness and lower conflict were associated with less behavior disturbance in the sibling.

AB- Developed an innovative, cost-effective, interdisciplinary educational intervention to address issues regarding the management of advanced prostrate cancer and pain. The intervention was delivered to 107 men using the teleconferencing method. The hour-long program consisted of 3 segments: 25 min of medical information provided by an urologist, 25 min of information about pain management and psychosocial issues provided by a social worker, and 10 min of questions and answers. A posttest was administered by telephone after the intervention, and 57 patients completed a mailed satisfaction survey. The response to the teleconferencing series was overwhelmingly positive. The results of the posttest revealed that patients received up-to-date medical and psychosocial information; Ss also demonstrated a good grasp of the material discussed. Broad participation was achieved in a cost-effective manner. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined the needs of 362 adult cancer patients (aged 28–86 yrs) from 2 distinct geographic areas in Ontario, Canada, who had received curative treatment for a malignancy not less than 6 mo before the beginning of the study. Ss completed a questionnaire regarding access to services, quality of care, need for information, financial needs, employment problems, physical changes, health behaviors, and relationship and emotional support issues. In general, the frequency of survivors who expressed a need in any particular area was lower than expected on the basis of qualitative reports in the literature. In fact, survivors tended to express needs related to modifying life-style behaviors and helping others through the treatment and recovery process. Thus, although there is a general impression that the negative consequences of surviving cancer are frequent, the actual prevalence appears to be relatively low.

KP- development & processes of practical & emotional support group
KP- 30–70 yr old spouses of patients with brain tumors
SU- Brain Neoplasms; Group Dynamics; Spouses; Support Groups
AB- Describes the initiation of a group to provide practical and emotional support for spouses of patients with brain tumors. Approximately 20 spouses (aged 30–70 yrs) attended the group, which lasted for 18 mo. The authors describe the formation of the group, group structure, group processes and group transition, which included coping with death, and group termination. The group helped facilitate the patients' home care and reduced the spouses' anxiety and depression, as conveyed by the spouses' verbal reports and their reluctance to terminate the group. The authors attribute the profound meaning of the group to its members to therapeutic factors that are unique to the interpersonal nature of most group processes. These factors include universality, altruism, information, and the instilling of hope. The authors also attribute the group's success to the fact that it served as a "transitional object" for group members undergoing the process of losing a loved one.

AB- Describes a structured, time-limited group focused on the development of social skills in boys (aged 10–14 yrs) who have a brain tumor. Social support and medical education were additional components. A parallel group for parents focused on relevant issues that arose in the boys' group and on the parents' general concerns about their child's social integration. The uniqueness of this program stemmed from the combination of development of social skills, specificity and homogeneity of the target population, highly structured group interventions, and parallel parent group. The program's efficacy in developing specific social skills was reported by both the boys and their parents. The authors recommend offering similar group interventions to other medically ill children and their parents, extending the model to female pediatric patients with brain tumors, and comparing time-limited versus ongoing groups for children with brain tumors.

AB- The effectiveness of a Coping With Cancer (CWC) intervention program for spouses of cancer patients was compared to the usual services that are offered to the spouses of cancer patients by the Oncology Department of a regional medical center. 66 spouses of cancer patients were recruited and randomly assigned to the CWC program or to usual services. Ss were assessed both before and after the intervention and again 6 mo after the 1st assessment on measures of (1) perceived health status, (2) psychological well-being, (3) social support, and (4) coping behavior. Patients whose spouses received services from the CWC program became significantly less depressed than did patients whose spouses did not. However, no other significant effects of the program were found for patients or spouses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- depression & anxiety
KP- 36–67 yr old female long-term breast cancer survivors who had been disease free for at least 5 yrs
SU- Anxiety; Breast Neoplasms; Depression (Emotion); Remission (Disorders)
AB- Reports the preliminary results of an ongoing study designed to evaluate the emotional status of 52 36–67 yr old long-term female survivors ("survivors") of breast cancer compared with 88 females who underwent low-risk breast cancer screening ("controls"). The survivors had no history of a psychiatric diagnosis and had been disease-free for at least 5 yrs. The Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were administered. Although the mean level of endorsement of depressive symptoms was within normal limits for the survivors, it was significantly higher than in the control group. The incidence of mild anxiety was also higher in the survivor group. The preliminary results show that mild emotional distress persisted in survivors 5 yrs and longer after the diagnosis of breast cancer. Further study is needed to assess the degree to which other psychosocial factors may contribute to this increased emotional distress in breast cancer survivors.

KP- role in assessment of spirituality as coping behavior of patients with advanced cancer
KP- social workers
SU- Coping Behavior; Social Workers; Spirituality; Terminal Cancer
AB- Social workers and other health care professionals often ignore spirituality, which is part of patients' ability to cope with advanced cancer. However, the social work perspective encourages a holistic approach, including engagement with patients about spiritual issues. The authors offer suggestions to practitioners regarding assessment of the contribution of a patient's spirituality to coping, including noting evidence of the patient's religious affiliation and responding to spiritual references and existential pondering. Interventions that support and reinforce patients' spirituality involve active listening and use of self to help patients explore the essentially unanswerable questions regarding life and death. Referral to a chaplain is particularly important when a patient raises questions about theology or religious rituals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- husbands of wives with breast cancer
KP- 1 yr study
SU- Breast Neoplasms; Emotional Adjustment; Health; Husbands; Social Support
AB- The effect of marital support and support from other adults on the emotional and physical adjustment of 121 husbands of women with breast cancer was examined. Role function and satisfaction with health care (SWHC) also were evaluated as predictors of adjustment. Intact data series were obtained at 7–10 days and at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 mo after surgery. At each data-collection point, the Ss completed 4 standardized inventories. Emotional adjustment could be predicted by satisfaction with the patient's response to interactional and emotional needs and by support from other adults. The relationships were significant at concurrent times, across contiguous times, and predictive from the 7–10 day postsurgical period to both the 6-mo and 1-yr end points. Although physical adjustment was predicted by support only at selected times, SWHC was predictive of perceived overall health status at 5 of the data-collection periods. Functional status in vocational domestic, and social roles was significantly related to emotional adjustment at all times with few exceptions and to physical adjustment at selected times. Type of surgery and stage of disease had an effect on selected physical and emotional outcomes over time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- usefulness & appropriateness of self-report checklist measures of coping in studies of adaptation to cancer
SU- Adaptation; Coping Behavior; Methodology; Neoplasms; Self Report
AB- Self-report checklist measures of coping continue to be widely used in research on cancer adaptation. The article considers the appropriateness and usefulness of checklist measures for studying the process of coping in this research. Some deficiencies of the conventional application of checklists are discussed, including the failure of checklist data to provide information on (1) the precise character of coping efforts, (2) the intentions underlying the use of specific coping mechanisms, and (3) the natural history or sequencing of coping efforts. Suggested refinements to the checklist methodology, such as the addition of focused probes to follow up endorsed checklist items, are discussed, and the strengths and weaknesses of two promising alternative or complementary methods, diaries and narrative analysis, are outlined. Finally, impediments to and impetuses for change in the assessment of coping are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

KP- spirituality & experience of cancer

KP- implications for psychosocial interventions
SU- Blacks; Neoplasms; Recovery (Disorders); Spirituality
AB- Examined the role of spirituality in the cancer experiences of 16 African Americans (aged 50+ yrs) living in the southern US. The study was conducted in 2 phases. In the 1st phase, without any investigator-initiated mention of spirituality, Ss referred to 28 categories of spiritual beliefs and practices that were relevant in their experiences with cancer. In the 2nd phase, which specifically explored spirituality, there was greater elaboration on the initial categories, and 7 additional categories were identified. Key findings included (1) the belief in God as the source of healing, (2) the value of prayer as an instrumental practice, (3) a strategy termed "turning it over to the Lord," and (4) the situating of the cancer experience within the larger life narrative. The author suggests that the willingness of care providers to address spiritual and cultural dimensions of cancer may greatly enhance therapeutic relationships and the efficacy of psychosocial interventions.

KP- cognitive behavioral therapy vs social support group
KP- psychological distress & coping style
KP- newly diagnosed cancer patients (mean age 53.4 yrs)
SU- Cognitive Therapy; Coping Behavior; Distress; Neoplasms; Social Support
AB- This article describes a study of 31 newly diagnosed, psychologically distressed cancer patients (mean age 53.4 yrs), 9 of whom were assigned to a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group and 8, to a social support group. An additional 14 patients were allocated to a "decliners" nonintervention group. When the interventions ended after 8 wks, the scores on the standardized scales for patients in both intervention groups demonstrated limited improvements in their psychological states and coping styles. The coping styles of the CBT patients improved significantly over those of patients in the other 2 groups. CBT may enable patients to overcome some of their psychosocial problems and to modify their coping styles. At the 3-mo follow-up no significant differences were observed between the 2 intervention groups, possibly because 2 CBT patients had died. Results suggest that both interventions, unlike a nonintervention, may buffer patients against psychological distress. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- conventional & complementary & holistic approaches to cancer treatment
KP- oncology professionals
SU- Alternative Medicine; Holistic Health; Medical Personnel; Neoplasms
AB- Because increasing numbers of cancer patients are seeking a more holistic approach to care, medical professionals need to integrate the best of conventional and complementary approaches to treatment. Why patients are seeking new approaches, which complementary therapies should be used, what the aims of these therapies should be, who should provide them, and who should pay for them are questions that are open to debate. Patients are not waiting for the debate on the efficacy and scientific rigor of these therapies to be resolved. Instead, they are searching for every possible way to benefit from a variety of alternatives. The realities of contemporary cancer care require oncology professionals to determine which forms of complementary medicine are at least neutral rather than harmful and, when possible, determine which are beneficial. By identifying interventions that are safe and effective, practitioners will be better prepared to respond to their patients' questions about additional therapies while encouraging a collaborative approach that incorporates conventional treatments and complementary therapies.

SU- Medical Patients; Neoplasms; Social Support
AB- To determine the perceptions of the role of cancer patients' companions in medical encounters with oncologists, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 18 patients (aged 20–74 yrs) and 17 companions (aged 23–71 yrs). Companions (most often a spouse) attended a medical encounter to provide support and companionship, increase patients' understanding, ask questions, and furnish transportation. Companions viewed themselves as more active than the patients perceived them to be. Patients perceived that the presence of a companion during an appointment resulted in little change in the content of the meeting. The authors concluded that the companion's presence during a medical encounter was important and satisfying to both patients and their companions.

The program committee is made up of a multidisciplinary team, including nurses, physicians, social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists, plus cancer-survivor volunteers. The "For Kids Only" program was developed to provide children with a safe environment in which they can share their thoughts and feelings and ask questions. Education, support, and screening were established as the goals of the program. The children are given age-appropriate information, and they learn new skills to help them cope more effectively throughout the cancer experience.

AB- 17 adolescents and young adults (aged 11–29 yrs) whose parents had cancer were interviewed before and after the parent's death. They were compared to 17 matched controls whose parents had survived cancer. Ss were divided into 2 groups on the basis of age and measures of psychological adjustment (PSD) used in the study. PSD in the adolescent Ss was assessed with the Youth Self-Report (T.M. Achenbach, 1991) and in the young adult Ss with the Brief Symptom Inventory. The fact that the 2 groups did not differ in degree of anxiety or depression suggests at least short term adaptation to the loss. Adolescents showed more anxiety and depression than did young adults, regardless of group membership. The respondents' adjustment at follow-up was predicted best by their previous adjustment.

AB- Tested the hypotheses that: (1) a number of features of The Children's Inn might be perceived as beneficial to the ill child and family members' emotional well-being; (2) making families responsible for their own daily needs at The Children's Inn would give them a sense of normalcy and a semblance of control over their lives. 102 families (91 parents, 50 patients and 11 siblings [aged 8 yrs and older]) were interviewed. The results supported the stated hypotheses. Nine out of 10 parents reported that The Children's Inn had a positive impact on their child's and their own quality of life. Both parents and patients agreed that staying at The Children's Inn made readjusting to home life easier. In addition, 85% of the parents and patients reported that staying at The Children's Inn made them less resistant to returning to National Institutes of Health.

AB- In a panel study of 125 10–70+ yr old patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong, the patients reported their desire for and satisfaction with the types of support they received throughout the course of their illness from family members, friends, and health professionals. Results showed that the patients' overall desire for social support was not strong during the diagnostic phase, but it became moderately strong during the treatment and posttreatment phases. Among the 3 sources of support, the patients consistently sought support most often from health professionals, followed by family, then friends. The patients' satisfaction with 4 types of support (informational, emotional, instrumental, and affiliational) from the 3 sources was moderately high in all 3 phases of the illness.

AB- Examined, in a home care program in Italy, the concordance between the ratings of 49 48–91 yr old patients with advanced cancer, relatives, and oncologists on a short-form quality of life (QOL) instrument and the concordance between relatives and oncologists on an index of patients' functional independence; and explored the correlations among the QOL ratings provided by the 3 rating sources with a patient-generated QOL instrument and an oncologist-generated rating of patients' performance status. The patients completed the QOL Index (QLI) and the Functional Living Index for Cancer (2–3 wks after admission to the program and 4 wks later), the relatives completed the QLI, and oncologists completed the QLI, Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living and the Karnofsky Performance Status scale. Overall, the QOL completed by the relatives and oncologists were associated with those of the patients. No difference was found between the QLI ratings of patients and relatives, whereas the oncologists rated the patient's QOL as being worse than the patients did.

AB- Investigated the meaning of the cancer experience for outpatients receiving radiotherapy. Data were collected through interviews with 44 male and female Caucasian and African American patients aged 30–89 yrs before treatment was initiated and within 2 wks after its completion 4–10 wks later. The results identified 3 categories of responses: accepting; coping; and experiencing emotional trauma. These labels were chosen to reflect the essence of the sentiments the patients expressed. Analysis of the responses reinforced the findings of other researchers that the experience of having cancer is emotionally challenging, if not traumatic. Majority of the patients were categorized as "experiencing emotional trauma" at the conclusion of treatment. Consistent with the findings of A. P. O'Connor, et al. (1990) and J. F. Miller (1985), many of the patients relied on the spiritual beliefs as a key source of support. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Studied the psychosocial situation of the spouses of patients with brain tumors. 24 male and female spouses of patients (aged 28–73 yrs) with Grade III or IV malignant glioma, who were included in a clinical trial between 1991 and 1993, were interviewed regarding experiences with medical care; knowledge and ideas about the disease; and the impact on the patient, family, work, interests, and future plans. Repeated interviews displayed 3 different crisis trajectories: crisis delayed until the disease progressed, immediate crisis, and crisis delayed until the patient returned home. The trajectories were highly dependent on the patient's overall status. Three clinical implications were suggested: spouses should be viewed as separate people with their own needs, spouses should have a physician of their own; and the concepts of mutuality and personal platform may be useful tools for assessing spouse's distress and means of coping with strain.

SU- Hope; Models; Neoplasms
AB- Attempted to build a model of the determinants of hope using path analysis. These results were based on a cross-sectional survey of 194 outpatients: 96 with ocular melanoma and 98 with head and neck cancer. The resulting empirical model emphasizes the importance of locus of control as either a direct determinant of hope or a factor that buffers distress and buttresses coping. The model also underscores the role that demographic characteristics, specifically, age, sex, occupation, and education, play as determinants of hope. The contributions of coping and physical and psychosocial functioning are named as indirect determinants of hope. Contrary to the literature and the hypothesized model, coping difficulties were not found to have a direct impact on hope. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- An adaptation of the D. F. Cella et al (1993) Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) was administered to 102 cancer patients who were undergoing outpatient chemotherapy. Unweighted scores and scores weighted by patient preference were calculated. Additionally, differences in the importance of the different domains of quality of life to the patient sample were explored. Relationship with Doctor was most important to the patients and Physical Well-being was least important. These results suggest that weighted scores can provide potentially important information to clinicians and researchers that is not available with unweighted scores. The weighting method one might choose to use depends on patient and study considerations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Presents findings from an exploratory study of treatment experiences and preferences of 51 Australian young people (aged 15–24 yrs) with cancer. The objective was to identify their information, support, and decision-making needs and preferences to inform health professionals. A 42-item self-administered questionnaire was developed to collect current and retrospective data. The young people wished to be more involved in treatment decisions. Almost all of them wanted to be informed about bad news, such as ineffective treatment, poor prognosis, and imminent death. Their preferences for involvement with health professionals, family, and peers in different contexts are reported. The qualities of health professionals that facilitated communication, according to the Ss, were the ability to listen, genuine concern, professional expertise, and honesty.

SU- Emotional Adjustment; Neoplasms; Social Adjustment
AB- Investigated cross-informant variance and longitudinal predictive relations among the perceptions of children, parents, and teachers of child adjustment in newly diagnosed pediatric cancer patients. Ss were 64 children (aged 5–13 yrs). Measures of adjustment included assessments of depression, anxiety, behavior, social acceptance, and social anxiety. Assessments were made 3 times over 9 mo for most Ss. Consistent with the general empirical literature on children, the results generally demonstrated small to medium effect sizes (rs of .10–.50) across the 3 groups, indicating the need for cross-informant assessment to determine the quality of life of pediatric cancer patients more adequately. Implications for treatment are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Evaluated 45 bone sarcoma patients (aged 11–24 yrs at diagnosis) who had survived an average of 7 yrs at the time of the study. Ss were assessed with both standardized measures of psychological symptoms and a semistructured clinical interview. No differences were found in the mean psychopathology scores of the 32 treated with a limb salvage procedure vs the 13 treated with initial amputation. Significant differences in psychosocial adaptation were found between the 2 groups. The amputees felt they were not employed at a level appropriate to their skills and training, and they were less likely than the limb salvage group to have married since the diagnosis. Good coping skills protected the limb-spared group, but not the amputees, from having higher scores on the measures of psychopathology, depression, and anxiety.

AB- Interviewed 8 cancer patients, 8 oncology nurses, and 8 other participants to identify nursing practices and characteristics that make a patient feel cared for. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze and categorize responses. Interrater agreement regarding identified behaviors was acceptable, whereas agreement for categorizations was low. The final categorization included 174 behaviors organized under the headings of social, communicative, organizational, medical-technical competence, and contact with relatives. The groups agreed fairly well on which behaviors make patients feel cared for. All groups mentioned behaviors representing the task-oriented, cognitive, emotional, and social aspects of caring, and members of all 3 groups mentioned behaviors specific for their own group.

KP- relationship of hopelessness to physical functioning & age & economic situation & survival
KP- 23-78 yr old hospitalized cancer patients
SU- Age Differences; Hopelessness; Mortality Rate; Neoplasms; Socioeconomic Status
AB- Examined correlates of hopelessness in 253 hospitalized cancer patients (aged 23–78 yrs) who were suffering from various diagnoses and were at different stages of disease. A 14-item Hopelessness Scale was found to be one-dimensional and satisfactory in terms of scalability and reliability. The distribution of the scale was skewed to the left, i.e., most patients displayed low feelings of hopelessness. A multiple regression analysis showed that the patients' physical functioning, age, and economic situation were significantly related to their scores on the Hopelessness Scale. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significant relationship between survival and hopelessness. However, a multiple Cox regression analysis showed that hopelessness was not significantly related to survival when other relevant covariates were controlled for.

AB- Examined the psychological, social, and economic impact of recurrent cancer and its treatment on an initial sample of 268 patients. Structured interviews were conducted at the initiation of palliative radiation therapy and 4 and 8 mo later, with 161 Ss from the original sample. Data were obtained on health status, psychological functioning, personality attributes, social support, health care utilization, and finances. Except for medical transportation, most of the patients' concrete needs did not change over time. Economic issues independently predicted psychological outcomes. Patients perceived stress, role restriction, self-esteem, and total symptoms decreased over time, whereas their dispositional pessimism increased.

AB- In open-ended interviews, 179 parents of 254 siblings (aged 4–18 yrs) of children with cancer evaluated the pre- and postdiagnosis adjustment of their children. 25% of the siblings were asymptomatic both before and after the diagnosis. Behavior and emotional problems were the most frequently reported problems arising after the diagnosis. Before the diagnosis, less than 12% of the siblings had either behavioral or affective symptoms, whereas 26% had such symptoms after the diagnosis. Type of maladjustment was unrelated to sex, birth order, or severity of the patient's illness. On the positive side, parents also reported favorable changes because of the illness in siblings' maturity, supportiveness, and independence. Positive effects were more likely to occur among adolescent and 1st-born siblings and when the patient's prognosis was poorer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined the beliefs of medical and radiation oncologists regarding psychosocial (PS) groups for patients with cancer. The willingness of oncologists to initiate referrals routinely to such groups was also examined. 16 adult-care oncologists completed a questionnaire regarding the harm or benefit they expected from PS groups and their views about appropriate intervention targets and timing. Ss were relatively unfamiliar with PS interventions, and referrals to PS services during usual care were scarce. Ss reported that harm to patients was not a major concern, but they did not anticipate much benefit either. Although 75% of Ss believed that initiating a PS program before a patient had accepted and been shown an oncology treatment plan would be harmful, benefits were expected during treatment and after existing therapies failed. Depression, anxiety, anger, and compliance with treatment were selected as appropriate focuses for PS groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined the long-term impact of children's bone marrow transplants on parents' mental outlook, relationships, and functional activities. A self-report questionnaire that included the Profile of Mood States and the Cancer Patient Behavior Scale was completed by 73 parents whose children successfully completed the transplant between 1–20 yrs prior to the study. The majority of Ss were not experiencing long-term psychosocial problems because of their child's bone marrow transplant. The most difficult period reported by Ss was the child's hospitalization, and the most distressed Ss were those whose child had received the transplant less than 24 mo before the study. Despite a general trend showing a decrease of problems and distress over time, several psychosocial problems remained: concerns about the child, insurance, finances, and the parent's own physical and mental health.

AB- Expanded on the M. L. Stuber et al (see record [rid]1992-20966-001[/rid]) study of the psychosocial impact of bone marrow transplants on 6 young children (aged 3–6 yrs at time of transplant) by examining the interactions between these 6 Ss and their parents. Data were collected from children and parents within a week before the transplant and 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo after the transplant using the Family Interaction Q-Sort with data from 20-min videotapes where parents completed 3 interaction tasks. Data were also collected for 7 control children (aged 3–6 yrs) and their parents. Parental responsiveness (PR) remained stable across time. Less parental education was associated with less responsive parenting. When PR was compared with children's symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), lower PR was associated with fewer symptoms and higher PR was associated with more symptoms. All parents used multiple coping patterns to handle their children's cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined the relationship of medical and psychological factors in mothers with breast cancer to their children's psychosocial adjustment. 19 White women with breast cancer, who had a total of 32 children (aged 3–18 yrs), responded to a semistructured interview and completed the Child Behavior Checklist, the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales III. On average, the children fell within the normal range for emotional and behavior problems and competence. Ratings of more emotional and behavior problems were linked with children whose mothers reported more psychological distress and a lack of serious complications in their illness. Mothers who did not experience serious complications of treatment also reported lower overall competence in their children. Family adaptability appeared to be related to the ability of mothers and children to cope with the mother's illness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined (1) the frequency of depressive symptomatology (DS) in parents of children (mean age 5.5 yrs) who were recently diagnosed with a chronic oncologic or hematologic disorder and (2) the relationship between intrusion and avoidance coping, parental perceptions of support, perceptions of the severity of the child's illness, and DS. Self-report questionnaires on depression, coping strategies, and perceptions of illness and support were completed by 32 parents within 6 mo of their child's diagnosis (Time 1) and by 21 parents approximately 12 mo later (Time 2). 14 parents at Time 1 and 7 parents (all mothers) at Time 2 had scores indicating DS. No significant change in mean depression scores occurred between Time 1 and Time 2. Avoidance coping was the only variable that significantly predicted DS at Time 1. Neither parents' perceptions of support nor perceptions of the severity of the child's illness were significant predictors for DS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Neoplasms; Professional Supervision; Social Work Education; Oncology
AB- Examined supervisory issues that arise when working with social work students who are placed in an oncology setting. 10 female hospital oncology supervisors were interviewed in a focus-group setting. Three main themes emerged during the interview. First, oncology social work is different from and perhaps more difficult than social work in other settings, and supervision of beginners differs from supervision of beginners in other specialties. Second, the problems in oncology are difficult to grapple with, and a certain type of student is required to do the work well. Finally, gaps in the curricula of schools of social work have a negative impact on the total learning experience of students in oncology and other medical settings. Concerns that students brought to supervision included somatic reactions, dissynchrony with peers, and countertransference. Recommendations for adequately preparing students for work in an oncology setting are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Investigated the relationship between coping strategies and self-reports of psychological adjustment among parents of children with cancer. 17 sets of parents who had a child in active treatment for cancer (CTC) and a control group of 32 sets of parents whose child had the flu completed the Coping Strategies Inventory, the Social Support Questionnaire, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. CTC parents rated their satisfaction with medical staff, and medical staff rated parents' coping styles and their appropriateness. Higher medical staff ratings of parental adjustment were correlated with more years of parental education. Among controls, engaged coping was related to less anxiety and depression and greater marital satisfaction; this relationship was not observed in CTC parents. Disengaged coping was related to greater levels of maladjustment for parents in both groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Conducted a cross-sectional study to explore the coping and adjustment process of breast cancer sufferers and their husbands. 36 breast cancer patients and their husbands provided information about how each recalled coping with stress during a course of radiation therapy. Spouses also reported on one another's coping efforts and provided information about their own current psychological adjustment and marital satisfaction. Wives engaged in more extensive and varied coping efforts than their husbands did, and the coping strategies that husbands and wives used were largely independent. Self-reported coping related to an individual's own outcomes. Significant crossover associations were found between the coping reports of one spouse and the marital satisfaction and mental health of the other; husbands' outcomes were more strongly correlated with their wives' reports of their own coping than vice versa.

SU- Coping Behavior; Emotional Adjustment; Neoplasms; Rating Scales
AB- Extended and refined the scope of the Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MAC) scale (M. Watson et al; see record [rid]1989-03649-001[/rid]), a self-report measure designed to give a rapid assessment of coping style. 573 cancer patients (aged 18–75 yrs) in either early or advanced stages of the disease completed a questionnaire containing the MAC scale and an additional 26-item research scale. A rigorous factor analysis procedure was used to determine the items that would be retained for a new scale: the 29-item Mini-MAC. The scope of the original MAC scale was widened to include items relating to avoidance (an important psychological response), and original response items were clarified and refined. Results suggest that the Mini-MAC should be a useful tool for obtaining a rapid, reliable, and economical assessment of coping style. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- 32–56 yr old oncologists
SU- Family Members; Neoplasms; Physicians; Therapeutic Processes
AB- Interviewed 12 oncologists (aged 32–56 yrs) to determine physicians' perceptions of the effects that the companions of cancer patients have on physician–patient communication. Ss estimated that 75% of their patients brought companions with them to consultations and said that these consultations were more complex for the physician. The behaviors of the companions varied from domination to passive note taking, and the companions who were young professional men or older women who accompanied their husbands were the most assertive and asked the most questions. All possible coalitions were observed during medical visits. Ss perceived that companions and patients often had different agendas and noted differences in the companions' behaviors according to their gender and whether they lived in rural or urban areas.

AB- Examined breast cancer patients' satisfaction with their medical and psychological care at the time of surgery and 1 yr later. Interviews were conducted with 162 patients the day before surgery, and 237 follow-up interviews were conducted 1 yr later. Ss reacted more positively than negatively to the service they received. Before surgery, complaints were positively correlated with the fighting spirit or anxious preoccupation style of coping and with anxiety and depression and were negatively correlated with denial and stoic acceptance and with age. Ss in lower SES groups complained less than did those in higher SES groups. A year later, complaints were positively correlated with overall distress scores. Ss with cancer plus other illnesses or with recurrent cancer complained the most. The complaints that were recorded suggest aspects of service that need to be improved, especially regarding physician–patient communication.

SU- Nervous System Neoplasms; Psychopathology; Psychotherapy; Social Adjustment
AB- Describes the psychiatric and psychosocial impacts of neurooncologic illness and its treatment on patients, families, and staff. The psychiatric and psychosocial impacts of CNS cancer and its treatment are unique, primarily because of their direct effect on the brain and thus on the mind, personality, memory, and concept of self. Patients can undergo dramatic changes in mood, cognitive integrity, and ability to function independently. The impact of these changes affects not only the patient but also the spouse, family, hospital staff, and other caregivers who are called on to provide an exhausting level of care. Psychotherapeutic interventions for patients and group interventions for spouses and hospital staff are also described. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The patients' complaints of marital difficulties, loss of functioning, exacerbated emotionality, and reactivation of feelings of victimization were treated in individual, couples, or group therapy. Individual or couples therapy was provided to husbands who were overprotective or withdrawn, with or without depression and anxiety. The outcomes of therapy, the criteria for deciding whether to refer patients and husbands for therapy, and the need for a female or male therapist are discussed. In addition to interventions involving the important aspects of support and behavior applications, traditional therapy can be used. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined potential sex differences in how parents cope and adjust when a child is diagnosed with cancer. 17 couples whose child had cancer and was in active treatment or follow-up were compared with 32 couples whose child had the flu. Findings did not support the main hypotheses that (1) fathers of cancer patients would use more maladaptive coping strategies and different social support systems than mothers and would be less anxious and depressed and (2) both parents would be more psychologically distressed than the controls. No significant sex-specific differences were observed in the experimental group: The parents appeared to be adjusting well and coping appropriately but were more anxious than the controls. Mothers in both groups reported more engaged coping styles, slightly more depression, and more use of social support than did fathers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined the responses of 16 partners and close family members (aged 27–57 yrs) who were bereaved when a partner or family member died of AIDS. Special emphasis was placed on the patterns of bereavement and possible signs of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the 2 groups of Ss. Ss who had lost lovers or family members to AIDS focused on the positive aspects of death and dying; most of them described loneliness and feelings of emptiness as their worst encounters with bereavement. The format of funerals appeared to encapsulate their feelings about the dead loved one and reactions to the loss. Self-euthanasia also generated ambivalent feelings. Ss received the most support from friends, support groups, or professional counselors rather than from family members. Most Ss showed little or no concern about their own future with regard to HIV or AIDS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Advance Directives; Client Attitudes; Health Personnel Attitudes; Neoplasms
AB- Examined how health care providers and patients believe information about advance directives (e.g., living wills) should be presented, noting that the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) of 1990 requires hospitals to tell patients about their right to complete an advance directive. When focus groups of 15 providers and 8 patients from a regional cancer center were held, nurses expressed more comfort with the requirements of the PSDA than did physicians, who were particularly concerned about the effect of the PSDA on their ability to treat patients in critical situations. Although patients were in favor of advance directives, they felt that admission was not the best time to learn about them. Testing the effectiveness of distributing written information to patients before admission and using specially trained personnel to discuss advance directives may be worthwhile.

SU- Distress; Empathy; Neoplasms; Self Disclosure; Therapeutic Processes
AB- Explores interactions between distress, empathy, and self-concealment in oncology work. Oncology staff and patients, like all people faced with stressful situations, are confronted with the dilemma of whether to conceal or reveal the distress they are experiencing. For both staff and patients, self-concealment as a coping response increases stress and simultaneously diminishes the likelihood of helpful, empathic responses from others. It is concluded that oncology staff must find safe contexts and confidants for sharing their inevitable fears, self-doubts, and uncomfortable feelings and must help patients resolve the distress-disclosure dilemma that attends the cancer experience.

AB- Discusses development of a computer-based support system to help women cope with breast cancer. The system, called Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS) contains integrated information, referral, decision, and social support programs. Two preliminary versions of CHESS were tested extensively by 10 younger women (mean age 51 yrs; 1st pilot study) and 20 older women (mean age 57 yrs; 2nd pilot study). Ss suggested several content enhancements and user-friendly aids for the developing system. User surveys indicate that CHESS was easy to use and would be valuable to other women with breast cancer, their partners, and their adult children. The Ss reported that they experienced more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions as a result of using the system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Laughter; Neoplasms; Nursing
AB- Discusses the physiologic, communicative, social-interactive, and psychological benefits of humor in the health care setting. While laughter therapy is not a curative treatment, much suffering has been alleviated through its use. The appropriate use of laughter for health care is discussed, as is initiating humor in the health care setting and developing a humor program. Nurses can assess the laughter needs of patients and interject humor into their nursing care plans. Positive emotions engendered by hospital humor can enhance prescribed medical treatment. One successful approach to introducing humor into a hospital setting is a hall-roving "Laugh Mobile." Its humorous novelties, books, and films help divert the attention of suffering patients to lighter thoughts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Models; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Rating Scales
AB- Compared the view of quality of life (QOL) derived from 2 different conceptual measures of QOL: the Ontario Cancer Institute (OCI) scale and the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS). The OCI scale, a functional living model, focuses on detecting physical and psychological distress and dysfunction. In contrast, the QOLS focuses on the meaning of the experience of illness for the patient, particularly patient beliefs and relationships. 38 cancer patients (aged 29–89 yrs) completed both questionnaires. The QOLS indicated greater dissatisfaction on the pain and depression items, information, and global QOL than did the OCI. No significant correlations between the 2 measures were found for the 3 non-function-specific psychosocial domains of family relationships, information, and social life. The QOLS produced more information on the 3 domains. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- roles & interventions in medical care
KP- parents of children with cancer
SU- Medical Treatment (General); Neoplasms; Parental Role
AB- Some parents deal with the medical and psychosocial challenges of childhood cancer by playing an active and assertive role in the medical treatment process. In this study involving 116 parents of children with cancer, 56% reported intervening at some point in the treatment process to prevent or correct a medical mistake. The nature of these interventions varied, but prominent among them were behaviors intended to (1) prevent or correct erroneous administration of drugs, (2) remind the staff of correct or incorrect procedures, (3) alter intravenous procedures, and (4) mediate the staff's style of interacting with ill children. Parents with fairly high levels of income and education and those who were active in a local self-help group reported that they intervened more often. Moreover, parents who reported less satisfaction with the emotional support they received from staff reported intervening more often. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Goals; Irrational Beliefs; Meaningfulness; Neoplasms; Optimism
AB- Examined 2 hypotheses about factors that would make it easier or more difficult to see one's life as meaningful after a major life stressor. 79 cancer patients (aged 31–82 yrs) and their spouses participated. It was predicted that greater meaning would be associated with positive interpretational styles (optimism and low endorsement of irrational beliefs) and a focus on internal rather than external goals. Results support the hypotheses: Greater meaningfulness was associated with optimism, few irrational beliefs, and endorsement of internal goals, even when physical functioning and depression were controlled for in a multiple regression analysis. Patients reported significant changes regarding irrational beliefs and internal goals subsequent to the diagnosis of cancer. Current beliefs and goals predicted meaningfulness, but reports of prediagnosis beliefs and goals did not. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Death Attitudes; Distress; Neoplasms; Spirituality
AB- Examined the relationship between transpersonal development and psychosocial distress of cancer patients. The study was based on a theoretical model of transpersonal development conceptualized as a relationship between one's personal perspective on death and one's level of spiritual awareness. 116 Ss (aged 18-83 yrs) with cancer completed a brief questionnaire concerning demographic and oncologic information, the Transpersonal Development Inventory, the Death Attitude Profile, and the Brief Symptom Inventory. A significant negative correlation between level of transpersonal development and level of psychosocial distress supported the major hypothesis. 24% of the variance in psychosocial distress was explained by normalization of death (13%) and age (11%).

SU- Family Relations; Neoplasms; Psychological Stress; Self Concept; Spirituality
AB- In a path analysis for 42 cancer patients (aged 31–75 yrs) and 32 spouses (aged 42–77 yrs), sense of coherence (SOC) was the only significant direct predictor of psychological stress. However, spiritual resources and family strengths had significant indirect paths through SOC as the mediator. Refined path models eliminated spiritual resources as a predictor for spouses but retained spiritual resources as an indirect predictor through SOC for patients. The variable of accumulated demands was not a direct predictor of stress for either patients or spouses. This result was contrary to a hypothesis in H. I. McCubbin and J. M. Patterson's (see record [rid]1984-12026-001[/rid]) Double ABCX model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The kinds of causal attributions that pediatric cancer patients and parents make about cancer were systematically examined to determine whether different types of attributions were associated with different coping strategies. 20 pediatric oncology patients (aged 4 yrs 10 mo to 19 yrs 5 mo) were interviewed to determine the kinds of attributions they made (if any) about their cancer. The parents also were interviewed concerning their causal attributions of their child's cancer and completed the Strategies for Coping with Illness—Parents' Scale to determine their coping strategies. Pediatric oncology nurses rated the children's coping strategies. Findings indicate that both patients and parents who made external types of attributions coped significantly better than did those who made internal types of attributions or accepted the physicians' advice that the cause of pediatric cancers (no attributions) was unknown.

SU- Age Differences; Emotions; Medical Personnel; Neoplasms; Therapeutic Processes
AB- Measured the processes and outcomes of emotional support in interactions between adult cancer patients and health providers. The patients included 21 young (aged 19–40 yrs), 22 middle-aged (aged 41–55 yrs), and 21 older (aged 56–75 yrs) adults. Emotional support processes were assessed as desired support, received support, and congruence. Outcomes were assessed according to patients' evaluative reactions and changed positive mood. During interactions with health care providers, older patients felt that intimacy was most important, whereas young patients felt that being able to ventilate their feelings was most important. In addition, the older patients received less emotional support from providers than did middle-aged patients, but young patients were more inclined than the other 2 groups to feel that the emotional support they received was not congruent with the support they desired.

SU- Adjustment; Breast Neoplasms; Marital Relations; Mastectomy
AB- Explored the marital adjustment and interactional patterns of 14 married couples 2–3 yrs after the wife had undergone a single mastectomy for Stage I or II breast cancer. Neither husbands nor wives were found to be psychologically symptomatic, and both had adapted well to the wife's illness. Measures of marital adaptation, however, showed significant differences from norms on cohesion and consensus, with marked patterns of enmeshment and fluidity of adaptation. Such findings generally indicate serious marital pathology. Measures of individual adjustment and the clinical presentation of spouses did not support that conclusion, however. Instead, the authors suggest that the findings regarding marital adjustment indicate a normal reaction to life-threatening events rather than a pathological process.

AB- Describes an innovative, open-ended support group with educational and recreational goals designed to meet the needs of patients and their families participating in prostate cancer research protocols at the National Institutes of Health. Weekly meetings alternated between didactic presentations and recreational outings. The group was developed and led by a social worker and a therapeutic recreation specialist. Guest speakers from many other disciplines contributed to the depth of programming offered. Evaluation of this approach after 4 mo showed that the program was beneficial for these patients, who would not participate in a more traditional support group.

AB- A questionnaire survey of 37 parents of childhood cancer survivors (median time from diagnosis = 11 yrs) was conducted to address their concerns. Parents whose child had completed cancer treatment still had pervasive concerns about their child's future health complications and feared the possibility of relapse. This group of parents showed no definite psychopathologies and in general seemed to derive the majority of support from their partner, with mothers receiving significantly more peer support than fathers. An overwhelming majority of these parents expressed a desire to maintain contact with health care providers for psychosocial support and education.

The process of decision making is explored as it applies to a representative case in clinical oncology. Psychological factors that complicate, and at times confound, ethical decision making also are examined. Finally, a point–counterpoint method is presented to help identify psychological and personal values that can obstruct ethical decision making.

The 2-yr project involved a physician from each of 3 wards, a psychologist, a contact nurse on each ward, and a resource group (e.g., a dietician, a medical social worker, a physical therapist). Methods developed for prevention or early detection and treatment of complications associated with chemotherapy included a structured interview at admission, a genogram, problem-mapping lists, a nutrition sheet, and symptom diaries. Patients' relatives also were included in the care efforts. When the results of the project were compared with the results of an evaluation conducted before the initiation of the project, a number of improvements were observed.

AB- Kids Can Cope is a group intervention designed to help children and teenagers (aged 5–18 yrs) who have a parent with cancer. The program is intended to (1) help these young people learn about cancer and its treatment, (2) provide them with opportunities to share their feelings in a safe environment with others in similar situations, and (3) increase their repertoire of coping strategies. Three themes that emerge consistently during the sessions are the universality of the group members' experiences, misconceptions about cancer, and themes specific to developmental age. Specific situations encountered in running the group and how those situations have been resolved are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Compared the self-concept of 62 children (aged 6–18 yrs) who had completed treatment for childhood cancer with that of 120 healthy children (aged 6–27 yrs). Global self-concept (the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale) was found to be similar and within normal limits in both groups. However, the cancer survivors reported more positive feelings about global self-concept than did the comparison group, and they received higher scores on 5 of 6 self-concept subscales. Furthermore, children in the survivor group reported feeling significantly better than the comparison group did about the self-concept aspects of their intellectual and school status, behavior, and overall happiness and satisfaction. The cancer self-concept profile that emerged from this study contributes to the recent literature on the normalcy and healthy psychological status of children who have a chronic illness.

AB- Described a study that qualitatively assessed the frequency of loss and recovery themes in a group of long-term survivors of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Surveys of 135 adult survivors of BMT (survival at least 6 mo and not in life-threatening relapse) compiled medical and demographic information and responses to a number of closed-ended and 9 open-ended questions, designed to bring out themes of loss and recovery. 350 themes of loss and 320 themes of recovery were identified in the comments. Classification of the respondents based on these themes revealed that 51.8% had a balanced view of their lives, whereas 26.7% focused more on loss, and 21.5% more on recovery. No strong pattern of relationships between the frequency of loss themes and survivor characteristics was found; the frequency of recovery themes was often associated with survivor characteristics.

SU- Attribution; Breast Neoplasms; Emotional Adjustment; Social Adjustment
AB- Explored the extent to which causal thinking and perceptions of control were associated with the psychosocial adjustment of women with breast cancer. 195 Ss completed a causal attributions interview, questions about perceived control, and 2 questionnaires about adjustment. Perceived loss of control was the most important factor in predicting overall adjustment, and thinking about "why me?" was the 2nd most important factor; thinking about "why me?" was 1st and perceived loss of control was 2nd in predicting psychological distress. The findings indicated that clinicians who work with cancer patients should be alert to adjustment problems in patients who express concern about "why me?" that feelings of loss may be a valuable feature in assessment, and that education about the growing effectiveness of therapies for breast cancer are especially important for coping.

AB- Attempted to replicate the findings of A. D. Davies et al (see record [rid]1988-30052-001[/rid]) by assessing various stressors in the lives of 74 patients waiting for a diagnostic evaluation for suspected head and neck cancer. Ss completed the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, a computerized questionnaire on alcohol use, the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, and the Global Assessment of Recent Stress, as well as an interview with a clinical social worker. 38% of the cancer Ss were pathologically anxious and 40% were depressed. However, patients with benign lesions were equally emotionally disturbed. Findings are consistent with the report of Davies et al of a high rate of depression among Ss with head and neck cancer before the biopsy but do not support their report that prebiopsy depression, but not anxiety, is higher in cancer Ss than in those with benign disease.

SU- Caregivers; Neoplasms; Pain; Questionnaires; Test Construction
AB- Reported on the evaluation of the Family Pain Questionnaire (FPQ) to measure family caregivers' experience with and knowledge about cancer pain. 85 patients (aged 26–95 yrs) with cancer pain requiring analgesics were identified. The Ss' primary caregivers were identified and were interviewed, using a demographic data tool, the Profile of Mood States, the Caregiver Burden Scale, the FPQ, and the Family Pain Survey. Caregivers' weakest areas of knowledge involved giving low doses of medication for fear of not having medicine available later, fear of respiratory depression from medication, and fear of addiction. Strongest areas of knowledge involved giving medication before pain was severe and believing in nondrug approaches for pain management. The study identified the impact that cancer pain has on caregivers and their need for education in pain management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- 44 newly diagnosed oncology outpatients (mean age 58.3 yrs) completed self-report forms that assessed their mood state and types and levels of psychosocial concerns at 3 points (at entry and 3 and 6 mo later) during their initial 6 mo of treatment. The levels of their psychosocial concerns were further assessed by auditing their medical records. The data analysis focused on how these measures of psychosocial concerns were related to stage of cancer, type of treatment, and levels of mood disturbance and psychosocial concerns. Stage of disease did not correlate with the levels and types of psychosocial concerns, whereas treatment modality and mood disturbance did.

Psychosocial adjustment was assessed with the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale. Data reveal that interactions with family members were important in determining whether a patient had adjusted effectively. Frequency of interactions and emotional support provided in the interactions were important discriminating variables of effective adjustment. Honesty and discussion of unpleasant topics were not identified as important discriminating variables. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Interviewed 9 camp directors, 10 camp counselors, 8 campers with cancer, 3 siblings of cancer patients, and 16 parents of cancer patients about the appropriateness of holding remembrance programs for deceased campers at a camp. The majority of campers and parents and the counselors who either had had cancer or had a sibling with cancer were in favor of holding remembrance programs at camp. They were in substantial agreement that older children should be involved in the decision whether to hold a remembrance program. Counselors who had no personal experience with cancer were uncertain about the beneficial effects of a remembrance program. Results are discussed in terms of the need to educate staff about the psychological and ethical aspects of including children in decision making.

AB- Examined the participation in 2 support groups of 154 cancer patients treated at a large cancer center. Ss most likely to participate were educated, younger, unmarried participants in other voluntary associations, and help seekers who had consulted mental health professionals. Social support had a complex relationship to participation. Ss with inadequate social support were especially likely to participate, but Ss with high scores on family support and cohesiveness were most likely to attend. Open-ended interviews reveal that the participants' major motivations for attending were to compare their own emotional and physical progress with others, learn more about their illness, and share concerns with other patients.

AB- 50 cancer patients (aged 38–79 yrs) and their spouses were asked to assess their current marital relationship and how they remembered it as being before the cancer diagnosis. Marital quality was assessed by interactional style, level of intimacy, and coping with problems. Personality was assessed by measuring stage of ego development: preconformist, conformist, or postconformist. Affiliation with the spouse had the highest correlation with the patients' quality of life, whereas coping with problems had the highest correlation with the spouses' quality of life. Patients who were at the postconformist stage of ego development were most likely to report that their marital relationship had become stronger over the course of their illness. Results are pertinent to the structuring of differential psychosocial interventions for patients and spouses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Emotional Adjustment; Hemophilia; HIV; Medical Treatment (General)
AB- Hemophilia, which had become a manageable chronic illness in the 1970s with the advent of coagulant factor concentrates, became a condition often shrouded in secrecy in the 1980s with the advent of HIV infection and AIDS. To help hemophiliac patients and their families manage the hemophilia and HIV infection, treatment providers must be aware of the variety of secrets that may have an impact on patients, parents, and the health care team. Some secrets, if not properly managed, may interfere with optimal medical care and the patient's subsequent emotional adjustment. Because secrets and their sequelae often become increasingly complicated over time, 2 case examples (males diagnosed with HIV infection at 8 and 10 yrs of age) are presented to illustrate the potential ethical, practical, moral, and legal difficulties that can arise.

AB- Describes the development of the Satisfaction with Life Domains Scale for Cancer (SLDS-C), a self-report instrument for assessing the subjective quality of life of patients receiving aggressive cancer treatment. The SLDS-C asks respondents to rate their satisfaction with 17 areas of life using 7 faces (3 smiling, 1 neutral, and 3 frowning). The instrument has the following advantages: It is acceptable to patients, is easily understood, and allows different degrees of either positive or negative responses. Evidence is presented of the reliability and validity of the scale based on the responses of 109 long-term cancer survivors who had received bone marrow transplants.

AB- Evaluated the prevalence and correlates of conditioned nausea (CN) in 39 relapse-free men 13–75 mo after completion of chemotherapy for testicular cancer. Ss completed the Eysenck Personality Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Autonomic Perception Questionnaire. 66% of Ss reported CN during the 1st 12 mo after treatment, but less than 50% of Ss reported it for more than 12 mo. Relatively high autonomic perceptivity and neuroticism were associated with the prevalence and slow extinction of CN. A history of motion sickness was linked to CN, but extroversion was related only to its prevalence. Ss who had experienced CN had received a greater number of chemotherapy cycles, and those with persistent CN also reported more profound vomiting during chemotherapy. Antiemetic treatment with high-dose metoclopramide during chemotherapy did not prevent development of CN but did tend to contribute to its faster extinction.

Psychotherapeutic methods that have proven to be effective involve direct confrontation of fears; expression of affect, including negative feelings; provision of social support; and training in self-hypnosis for analgesia. Possible mechanisms for this psychosocial effect on progression of disease include changes in diet and exercise, better use and provision of health care, and positive effects on the sensitivity of the endocrine and immune systems to stress.

AB- Describes the obstacles of people with cancer involving schooling, military service, employment, and insurance that hinder a full life after cure and suggests strategies for supporting a partnership consisting of the medical team, the patient and family, and peer organizations to overcome these obstacles. The goals of this partnership are to create educated, empowered, competent survivors of cancer who can participate effectively in life. These strengths can be built through acquisition of survivorship skills, which are gained through education and information programs during treatment, continuing information after treatment, and networking with peers and advocacy organizations. Opportunities for patients and families to demonstrate their competence include informed consent procedures, monitoring of medications and other home-based tasks, and dialogs with the medical care team.

AB- Describes the historical development and current focus of the Parent Advocate Program (PAP) within the Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The PAP is under the auspices of the organization called CURE: Counseling, Understanding, Research, and Education. Responsibilities of parent advocates (PAs) include meeting parents of all pediatric hematology/oncology patients, reporting to appropriate medical or psychological staff situations that arise during visits with parents, and explaining support services available through various community agencies and organizations. The authors discuss potential pitfalls such as emotional involvement with families on the PA's part and present ingredients for the development of a successful program, including careful selection of people who can interact successfully with staff and learn the professional role of PA.

The recent development of a unitary measure that combines length of survival and quality of life may be helpful in weighing the outcome of different primary treatment options. Also addressed is the possible interaction of psychological, endocrine, and immune function variables in cancer morbidity and mortality. Findings may show that interventions based on psychophysiological interactions can have salutary effects on cancer treatment. Patients' responses to holistic programs and coping styles are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Reviews literature on family adjustment to cancer and identifies the factors that consistently predict the extent of psychosocial problems experienced by family members. A conceptual model is applied that views the degree of family strain as being determined by the objective factors of the illness itself and family context variables. Regarding objective factors, the degree of family strain is affected primarily by the severity of the illness and the patient's own level of distress. Contextual variables such as age, gender, and health of family members; their other life stressors and previous psychological problems; family stage and relational bonds; and social supports of family members contribute to the psychosocial impact of illness on the family.

SU- Death and Dying; Death Attitudes; Grandparents; Grief
AB- 56 children (aged 8–12 yrs) and 19 pairs of their parents were interviewed after the death of each child's grandparent. The children were asked questions about (1) their former relationship with the grandparent, (2) how they learned of the death, and (3) their mourning rituals and reactions. Many of the children's comments seemed straightforward and mature, suggesting a level of insight and self-awareness not usually attributed to children, whereas the parents' comments revealed a lack of awareness regarding their children's thoughts and feelings about the death. Parents who share their insecurities or hesitancies with children, acknowledge their inability to alleviate all the discomfort surrounding a death, and help the children formulate questions rather than attempt to supply them with ready answers may be more effective in helping children develop and in providing them with lasting comfort.

AB- Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) causes patients significant distress, and their families are expected to play a major role in how patients adapt during hospitalization. The authors initiated a prospective study of 160 significant others to examine the family as a social resource and evaluate family members' psychological functioning. To date, families have provided data about the impact of medical information, their decision making about BMT, the physician's influence, and their belief that treatment will be successful. Preliminary data suggest that families need education before the BMT and may need psychosocial intervention afterward. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- 32 women (aged 33–87 yrs) with gynecologic cancer who had been treated with a radical hysterectomy, a vulvectomy, or total pelvic exenteration and were currently disease-free were studied. The patients' average score on the Functional Living Index—Cancer was 124 (i.e., most reported a good quality of life). Their scores on the SCL-90 (Revised) reflected moderately elevated levels of psychological distress that were comparable to levels of breast cancer patients who had participated in an earlier study (C. S. Roberts et al, 1991). The authors found a strong negative correlation between age and psychological distress; younger Ss appeared to be more at risk for psychological problems after radical gynecologic surgery.

Data were collected from 14 families participating in a weekend retreat program (the Massachusetts We Can Weekend). Those families who communicated frequently and used a variety of coping strategies reported less difficulty coping with cancer than did those who used fewer strategies. Findings suggest that participating in interventions such as the We Can Weekend can enhance family members' ability to cope by increasing their use of communication and social support.

In addition, the authors provide a framework for the approach and suggest strategies for involving not only administrators and members of the medical team but also survivors themselves in developing effective programs and overcoming potential service barriers.

SU- Coping Behavior; Neoplasms; Parents; Support Groups
AB- A pilot project called "Bear Essentials" was developed at Missouri Baptist Cancer Center in St. Louis for 30 young children of 21 cancer patients (aged 25–48 yrs) to help families (1) understand how children perceive illness, separation, and loss, (2) discuss the concerns of patients, spouses, and children in a supportive environment, and (3) develop coping strategies to better manage the emotional difficulties caused by a parent's illness. Children and parents met separately in concurrent monthly support groups led by a team composed of a social worker, nurses, and a chaplain. This article examines the literature on the children of cancer patients, describes the process of developing the project, and discusses the content, assessment, and outcomes of the project. It concludes with recommendations for replication, with specific emphasis on the use of an interdisciplinary team approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Neoplasms; Physical Treatment Methods; Sexual Function Disturbances; Social Casework
AB- All cancers affect body image and self-image and thus have the potential to diminish sexual functioning and feelings of sexual attractiveness. Nevertheless, patients and health care professionals often avoid discussions about changes in sexual functioning and intimacy. The oncology social worker is in a unique position to use a portion of the routine biopsychosocial assessment to inquire about changes in sexual functioning and intimacy. The authors review the common psychosocial problems associated with these changes, the timing of the assessment, the oncology social worker's role, and approaches to intervention with patients and their partners. In addition, 2 case examples of 2 women with breast cancer are provided to illustrate these approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Although often sensationalized in the media, addictive behaviors and co-dependency cause painful dilemmas for millions of Americans. Unfortunately, many people with these disorders also are diagnosed with cancer or have a family member with cancer. Addiction and the problematic coping style associated with it are rarely addressed by oncology staff. However, data collected through the Johns Hopkins Cancer Counseling Center indicate that 21 of 36 patients referred for long-term counseling were addicts and that 15 were co-dependent. The authors address the problem of identifying patients and families with these disorders and describe appropriate methods of helping them cope with the added distress caused by the diagnosis of cancer.

Results suggest that psychological coping styles and distress should be included as prognostic indicators for BC patients. Better outcomes in the quality of life of BC patients have been noted among women who take an active role in monitoring their health while undergoing diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. Active involvement includes problem solving, the expression of emotion, and restructuring one's lifestyle. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Eight veteran colostomy patients who were motivated to serve as volunteer counselors for new patients received a 10-wk group training course. The goal was to train group members to help patients adjust and achieve an independent, self-help body. Training was conducted under the guidance of a social worker and a stoma-training nurse. During the 1st yr, the volunteers met with 38 patients. Based on the volunteers' descriptions of their activities, the program appeared to have met its goals.

AB- Reviews clinical and research literature on family problems during 6 phases of cancer: diagnosis, hospital, posthospital, adjuvant treatment, recurrence, and terminal. The results extend the data on problems and phases identified by L. Northouse (see record [rid]1985-23011-001[/rid]) in an earlier review. It is suggested that family members need to be included in social service planning from the onset of the patient's illness. Family problems, which often mirror those of patients in both scope and depth, are still too often ignored. By more adequately meeting the variety of psychosocial needs that caregivers and patients encounter at each phase of illness, the service system can help reduce both the immediate and long-term emotional costs for all family members.

AB- 118 children (aged 8–16 yrs) who had survived cancer and 120 of their parents were interviewed. 47 children commented positively on surviving cancer, in a variety of ways, including denial, and 71 stressed the negative impact. Negative responses concerned worries about health, problems with late effects, anger at having been ill, and family interaction. 92 of the parents' responses were positive and 95 negative. Positive responses concerned support systems, new values and attitudes, and marital adjustment. Negative comments concerned health worries, marital problems, and attitudes such as anger and guilt. The findings support the need for continued clinical intervention for both these populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Interviewed 21 children (aged 10–21 yrs) on their experiences as siblings of children with cancer. The Ss almost universally expressed worry and distress about the illness. Home life was typically disrupted, and an atmosphere of sadness prevailed. The Ss generally expressed a wish to care for the ill sibling and often seemed to be aware of the stresses their parents experienced. Some noted that they had attained greater maturity and coping ability. Suggestions for parents and professionals are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined the utility of the Omega Screening Instrument (OSI) for predicting subsequent emotional distress in patients newly diagnosed with cancer. 100 patients in the rural southwest, diagnosed with cancer within the previous month, completed the OSI and the Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) scale of the Profile of Mood States. Ss who were able completed the TMD again after 3 and 6 mo. The OSI was helpful in predicting which patients would develop emotional distress over time, but not as accurately as in an earlier study in a northeastern city (see J. W. Worden, 1983).

Reliability was examined in a study involving 237 college students, convergent and discriminant validity in data from 96 cancer patients (mean age 58.3 yrs), and correlations with quality of life and locus of control scales in, respectively, 47 male colostomy patients, and 26 adolescents (aged 12–21 yrs). A 2nd analysis of factorial validity involved 51 additional patients (mean age 61.6 yrs). The CMT was reliable, and the 4 scales discriminated between cancer patients and nonpatients and between lung cancer and colorectal cancer patients.

AB- Examined 412 cancer patients' (aged 21–91 yrs) knowledge and willingness to use agency-based services as part of a survey documenting the prevalence of the daily living needs of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. In addition, the efficacy of classifying the patients' readiness to use agency-based services along the stages of change dimension of a model of behavioral change, the transtheoretical model (e.g., J. O. Prochaska and C. C. DiClemente; see record [rid]1983-26980-001[/rid]) was explored. Most Ss reported no past contact with formal service providers. More than two-thirds never used a community resource for instrumental or administrative assistance in daily living, nearly 50% did not know about available services, and 10–22% said they would be unwilling to use such services in the future. The characteristics of Ss who knew about available services or were willing to use services differed as a function of the domain of daily living activities.

Gender, surgical variables, and the extent of the patient's social support predicted the use of esophageal speech. Preoperative visits by fellow laryngectomees predicted later quality of life. Poor psychological adjustment was related to the length of time spent in the hospital after surgery, dissatisfaction with social support, and changes in lifestyle after surgery. Changes in identity also were predictive of both psychological adjustment and quality of life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Explains how the Nowotny Hope Scale (NHS) by M. Nowotny (1989) can be used to assess patients' hope. The NHS assesses 6 components of hope: confidence in the outcome, relationships with others, belief in the possibility of a future, spiritual beliefs, active involvement, and inner readiness. The subscales of the NHS provide a framework for the development and implementation of strategies to maintain, reinforce, and facilitate hope. Sources of hope as well as conflicts between the hopes of health care providers and cancer survivors are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Presents the personal perspective of a 40-yr cancer survivor. The author's medical and personal histories lead to a discussion of the fear and secrecy that once shrouded the cancer experience and its survivors. Communication, hope, and support are seen as integral elements of survival. By taking responsibility for oneself, one has the potential to achieve balance and to integrate the physical, emotional, spiritual, intellectual, and social aspects of one's life.

Scores on the 4 CMT scales (terminal pessimism, future optimism, natural disaster, foreign intruder) did not correlate significantly with CA or occupational status, and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated no significant ethnicity-by-scale interaction, with the Chinese Ss scoring higher than Americans on future optimism and lower on natural disaster. An analysis of the individual metaphors rated most and least appropriate indicated both substantial differences and similarities between ethnic groups and gender.

Ss were divided into 3 groups. 24 Ss and their relatives received systematic information about the disease; 22 Ss were given the same information, but their relatives did not participate; and 25 Ss received normally dispensed information. Congruence and type of information had an important influence on Ss' psychosocial adjustment, as mediated by a number of variables related to how information was given (systematically and sequentially) and how the effects of the information were evaluated (short- vs long-term effects and personal vs interpersonal effects).

AB- Used a case-study quasi-experimental design to examine 50 pediatric cancer patients' (aged 7–16 yrs) perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of peer relationships developed at a 1-wk camp for pediatric cancer patients. Results of questionnaires and interviews show that Ss went to camp to make new friends and have a good time. Most Ss established relationships that lasted after the camp ended. Ss believed that empathy, understanding, and acceptance were the major benefits of friendships with other young patients. One difficulty in having relationships with other cancer patients was the reminder to Ss that their own disease might return. Ss also wanted to develop and maintain relationships with healthy peers.

AB- Art therapy can be a powerful tool to facilitate the emotional expression of children with cancer and their healthy siblings. Three structured art therapy techniques are described: (1) the mandala (color–feeling wheel), (2) the change-in-family drawing, and (3) the "scariest" drawing. A letter-writing technique also is discussed. The structured aspect of these methods allows the therapist to ask highly focused questions and to interpret the drawings within the context of the individual child's reality. The techniques can be adapted for individuals ranging from age 3 yrs to adulthood and can be used in individual, family, or group psychotherapy.

Variables examined across the studies include demographic factors, stage of disease and treatment, the types of social support patients received, and how the support was measured. An attempt is made to evaluate the relationship between stages of the disease process and the type of social support best suited to the individual patient and her family.

AB- Examined coping as an interpersonal process by assessing psychological distress, marital cohesion, marital satisfaction, marital history, and use of several coping strategies of 22 breast cancer patients (aged 30–70 yrs) and their husbands. Measures included the SCL-90 (Revised). Husbands' coping behaviors and ratings of the relationship were the best predictors of wives' psychological distress, whereas husbands' distress depended on a combination of their own and their wives' coping behaviors. Results suggest that interpersonal variables are equal to, or more important than, individual variables in the effectiveness of coping. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- role of self esteem & use of Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale
KP- cancer patients
SU- Neoplasms; Rating Scales; Self Esteem
AB- Discusses the role of self-esteem in cancer research. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE), developed by M. Rosenberg (1965), is described, and results of 16 studies (published 1979–1989) that have used this measure are reviewed. No definitive picture of self-esteem in cancer patients has emerged because of differences in scoring the RSE. Global self-esteem, as measured by the RSE, may not be the only aspect of self-concept that is relevant to cancer patients. Self-esteem, although routinely considered to be an outcome variable in cancer research, also can be conceptualized as a causal agent. The relationship between hypothetical mechanisms of how self-esteem is involved in adapting to cancer and possible interventions is addressed.

Problems in the desire, excitement, and orgasm phases are discussed in addition to special considerations that apply when cancer patients need sex counseling or sex therapy.

AB- In Study 1, a cross-sectional study of 81 adult patients, the Ss perceived high levels of social support, but those who communicated most about cancer had the lowest self-esteem. The data suggest that communicating with significant others about the disease may damage a patient's self-esteem even when the others are perceived as generally extremely supportive. In Study 2, 99 adult patients were assigned to standard information, enhanced information, and shared information conditions. In the 1st condition, the inverse relationship between communication and self-esteem was replicated. In the 2nd, no relationship was found between self-esteem and communication. In the 3rd, higher levels of communication were associated with greater self-esteem. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- Great Britain & Europe vs US
SU- Experimentation; Neoplasms; Psychosocial Factors; Quality of Life; Oncology
AB- Surveyed British and European research groups to review current research on quality of life and psychosocial oncology. 28 groups responded. Active areas of research include (1) methods of assessing quality of life (validation studies, instrument comparison and translation, new scales, cross-cultural comparisons), (2) integration of quality-of-life measures into clinical trials, (3) the coping process, and (4) rehabilitation and supportive care. In contrast, US researchers focused on the more pragmatic aspects of psychosocial oncology, especially the psychosocial sequelae of a cancer diagnosis. This divergence in approach may relate to cultural characteristics as well as differences in the research funding process. Most of the survey respondents were enthusiastic about pursuing cooperative research with North American investigators, and the review identified many areas for potential collaboration.

AB- Examined 53 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and 53 controls to determine whether the family environment of the patient who drops out of chemotherapy treatment is worse than that of the patient who completes treatment. Ss were interviewed in their homes. The majority of Ss in both groups said they had been accompanied to the clinic during treatment (research group, 31; control group, 33). No proof was found that family environment influences cancer patients to drop out of treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Interviewed 24 male and 20 female pediatric oncology patients (aged 6–18 yrs) to assess behavioral coping strategies during invasive medical procedures. The behavioral strategies of 42 Ss were subsequently categorized into information seeking, information avoiding, and mixed coping styles (COSs). COS was unrelated to age and gender but was significantly related to measures of disease chronicity and number of previous procedures. No differences were found among Ss who had different COSs on subjective ratings of anticipatory fear and degree of pain experienced or on behavioral observations of distress during invasive procedures.

SU- Blood Transfusion; HIV; Neoplasms; Psychosocial Factors
AB- The diagnosis of transfusion-induced infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 5 pediatric patients (aged 3–20 yrs) at a cancer institute had a widespread and powerful psychosocial effect. The effects of these diagnoses on patients infected with HIV with and without symptoms, on patients still at risk, on patients' families, and on members of the health care team are discussed. The helplessness everyone experienced evoked memories of pediatric cancer treatment more than 25 yrs ago and stimulated reflections on the assumptions, motivations, and satisfactions of caregivers in a pediatric oncology setting. Suggestions for limiting anxiety and maximizing open communication are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Explored the relationship between various facets of adaptation to cancer and psychosocial outcome variables assessed in survivorhood. 44 children (mean age 10.34 yrs) and their parents were assessed 2–7 yrs after the children had completed treatment. Parental reactions to the Ss' illness were related to a variety of psychosocial variables (e.g., perceived financial burden concerning the costs of the illness and its treatment). Most important, parental coping was associated with the long-term adjustment of both parents and the Ss. The amount of emotional distress that parents experienced was related to their ability to establish and maintain socially supportive ties with other people.

Considerable interindividual variation in psychosocial response to cancer was found, but the variation was not associated with the site of the disease. Breast cancer Ss tended to adapt more effectively to their illness than did the others. Age, marital status, time since primary treatment, and prognosis were not significantly associated with psychosocial status, but severity of physical impairment and discomfort were powerful predictors of psychosocial status.

Fighting spirit was related reliably to better psychosocial adjustment, and coping by avoidance was related reliably to poorer adjustment. Denial was not related reliably to any of the adjustment measures. Similarly, reliable relationships were not found between either disease status or duration of illness and adjustment to the illness.

The unique vulnerabilities and needs of this population are illustrated in a discussion of 7 women who exhibited unusually intense grief and anticipatory grief reactions. Six of the Ss had been sexually abused by their fathers and 1 S had been sexually abused by her stepfather. The literature on the long-term psychosocial impact of sexual abuse in childhood and to normal and complicated grief is reviewed. Two case studies are followed by a discussion of the intrapsychic and interpersonal processes that maintain complicated patterns of grief. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- pain associated with cancer & diagnostic & treatment procedures
KP- 2–19 yr olds
SU- Medical Diagnosis; Medical Treatment (General); Neoplasms; Pain
AB- A survey of 77 child and adolescent outpatients (aged 2–19 yrs) at a cancer clinic and their parents showed that many children suffered pain from the cancer, the diagnostic and monitoring procedures, and the treatment. Alternatives to painful diagnostic and treatment procedures are recommended, including the evaluation of analgesic regimens, the development of more efficient and effective psychological techniques, and the development of treatment protocols with fewer invasive tests.

Although a better awareness of cancer pain has resulted in major advances in the ability to manage the problem, research is needed on the natural history and management of other symptoms associated with advanced cancer, some of which can be more distressing and more difficult to manage than pain.

Discussion includes the evolution of the concept and its potential application to the evaluation of outcome, both for individual patients and for clinical trials. These concepts and applications are examined in 4 parts: conceptual foundations (components and operational characteristics), the design of measurement tools, the conduct of trials, and the interpretation of results.

AB- Examined the coping responses of 11 nurses in a bone marrow transplant unit who were exposed to a stressful series of events. Ss completed an assessment battery of 6 instruments. Significant differences in reactions to stress were observed; these differences were related to factors such as coping strategies, job involvement, role conflict, and home–work conflict. Further analysis included comparisons of the unit data with a large normative sample of nurses at the same hospital. Results support the usefulness of a transactional process-oriented model in addressing the issue of stress in oncology settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Health Education; Neoplasms
AB- Describes an approach to promoting wellness in people with cancer which is broader than a skill training model. It combines popular stress-management techniques with a set of 8 beliefs (e.g., responsibility, hope) that are useful for cognitive restructuring. These beliefs, modified with qualifiers introducing appropriate realism, constitute a wellness doctrine that can serve as a basis for intervention with a variety of common clinical problems. Case examples (including a 61-yr-old male with prostate cancer) are presented, and 4 subtypes (realists, opportunists, zealots, and fighters) of patients who present for wellness promotion are described.

AB- Tested the hypothesis that cancer patients who are more debilitated receive less social support than do others. A structured interview, including 3 social support measures, was completed for 707 newly diagnosed cancer patients (aged 45–90 yrs). Several characteristics of the disease were associated with lower levels of social activity: pain, perceptions of a poor prognosis, impaired functioning, and number of days recently spent in bed.

AB- 52 male and 103 female undergraduates read 1 of 3 descriptions of a breast cancer patient that were identical except for the degree of relationship (mother, neighbor, or family friend) they were to imagine that they had with the patient. They then completed a 12-item questionnaire concerning their perceptions of and reactions to the patient. For all instances in which a significant effect for condition emerged, the neighbor or the family friend received more negative reactions than did the mother. Males were less likely than were females to believe that the patient could return to work within 3 mo after hospitalization and to fear they would get cancer after visiting the patient.

Results obtained from 85 men who had been treated for Hodgkin's disease indicate that more sedentary activity patterns are positively correlated with scores on the fatigue subscale of the Profile of Mood States (POMS), whereas more active patterns are positively correlated with scores on the POMS vigor subscale, self-reports of energy level, and self-ratings of health status. Perceived energy levels interact with activity patterns at leisure but not at work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Knowledge of the impact that breast cancer has on self-esteem and well-being has been limited, conceptually, by the failure to consider potentially positive outcomes after diagnosis and treatment and, methodologically, by an overall lack of focus on well-being. Sixty-four women with breast cancer and 64 age-matched women without cancer completed three measures of self-esteem and five measures of well-being. The results supported the theoretical notion that the potential impact of breast cancer on a woman's self-esteem and well-being can be positive as well as negative. The results also highlighted the importance of considering the full impact of cancer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Discusses the collaboration between hematologists and mental health professionals on a bone-marrow transplant team and suggests that such a collaboration reflects the recognition that emotional stress is a significant component of life-threatening diseases. This new professional relationship relieves the pressures on the physician and nursing staff, provides psychological continuity in patient care, broadens the scope of the team's knowledge of patients and their families, and allows for preventive intervention. The cases of a 7-yr-old boy and a 25-yr-old woman illustrate the collaboration. (8 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- regular practice of breast self examination & immediate vs delayed seeking of treatment for symptoms of breast cancer
KP- female breast cancer patients
SU- Breast Neoplasms; Health Behavior; Health Care Utilization; Human Females; Prevention
AB- Examined the relationship between breast self-examination (BSE) and delay in seeking treatment in 129 female breast cancer patients, who were interviewed in their homes for 90 min. Ss were divided into 2 groups with respect to BSE: those who examined their breasts at least once a month (n = 57) and those who did so less frequently or not at all (n = 72). Results show that the regular practice of BSE was unrelated to the immediate seeking of treatment for symptoms of breast cancer. Ss who practiced BSE and delayed seeking treatment were older than other Ss who practiced BSE, and they were more likely to have had a family member who had experienced prolonged or painful deterioration because of breast cancer. Both BSE and delay were significantly associated with the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis, and Ss who practiced BSE and sought treatment quickly were most likely to be diagnosed at an early stage.

AB- Discusses the use of psychoactive medication to treat psychopathology in pediatric oncology patients, noting that psychoactive medications are often required to treat anxiety, depression, pain, and psychotic-organic brain syndromes. In general, the most familiar psychoactive medication, prescribed at the minimal effective dose, should be used for short-term relief of symptoms. Psychoactive medications may be the most useful in conjunction with other forms of therapy. (10 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Two studies examined the attitudes of Laetrile patients and their physicians. In Exp I, 12 patients (mean age 56 yrs) who elected to receive Laetrile were matched and contrasted with 12 patients (mean age 58.8 yrs) who agreed to undertake Phase II treatments (i.e., therapy that is endorsed by the medical community). Results suggest that the Laetrile patients were more skeptical and alienated from the medical establishment than were the Phase II patients. In Exp II, a survey of 8 physicians and 2 nurses revealed that they had a general skepticism toward Laetrile and a tendency to perceive patients who took Laetrile as more depressed and anxious than patients who undertook more conventional treatments.

AB- Examined characteristics of 53 female and 42 male participants (n = 36) and nonparticipants (n = 59) in a self-help group for parents of children with cancer. Ss were interviewed for approximately 90 min to assess the nature of the diagnosis, the course of the illness, problems the family encountered, social support, and experiences with medical staff. Results show that participants and nonparticipants did not differ on the bases of gender, education, income, or attitudes toward the medical system. However, parents who lived closer to the hospital, whose children had been diagnosed 1–4 yrs previously, and who reported a high degree of stress from their child's illness were more likely to participate in the group. The importance of self-help groups as a resource for parents of children with serious and chronic illnesses is discussed. (72 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- validity of emotional control as personality trait
KP- females with breast cancer
SU- Breast Neoplasms; Emotional Control; Human Females; Personality Correlates
AB- Investigated emotional control in 30 breast cancer patients and 27 women who had attended a breast-screening clinic and had no evidence of a malignant breast tumor. Stress was manipulated experimentally through the use of 3 videotapes (2 emotionally challenging tapes and 1 emotionally neutral tape). Measures of personality (e.g., the State-Trait Personality Inventory), behavior (Ss' behavioral responses were videotaped throughout the stress manipulation), and mood state (linear analog scales) were taken. Ss completed the personality measures and one of the analog scales before viewing the tapes. After viewing each tape, Ss completed the 2nd analog scale and a questionnaire on their reactions to the tape. Results support the hypothesis that the breast cancer patients would be more emotionally inhibited. Self-report measures indicated that although the patients tended to control or repress their emotional reactions, they were more anxious and disturbed as a result of the stress manipulation than were the controls. Findings are discussed in relation to current theories of emotion and to psychobiological models. (30 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Interviews with 78 29–78 yr old breast cancer patients were analyzed to document perceptions of changes in their relationships with their children. The significant others of 63 of the patients were also interviewed. Results show that although the majority of mother–child relationships were reported to have stayed strong or to have grown stronger following breast cancer, deterioration was evident in 12% of the relationships. Problems with children were more likely when the patients had a poor prognosis, more severe surgery, poorer psychological adjustment, and, to a lesser extent, more difficulty with radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The mothers' relationships with their daughters were at a significantly greater risk than were the relationships with their sons. The fear of inheriting breast cancer and the mother's demands on the daughter for support were judged to be major contributing factors to the difficulties with adolescent and postadolescent daughters.

AB- Examined the relationship of patients' physical health status and social environment to depression in 21 White lung cancer patients (mean age 61.8 yrs) and 18 of their spouses. Psychosocial and physical data on the patients and spouses were gathered for 6 mo after the patients' diagnosis to determine the relationship of the social environment and the patients' physical status to depressive symptoms (the Profile of Mood States) in patients and spouses. It was found that physical status was related to depressive symptoms in patients but not in their spouses. The spouses' depressive symptoms were independent of the patients' physical status but were related to a measure of involvement in the social environment (the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale). Findings highlight the importance of screening spouses of cancer patients for psychosocial impairment and the fact that such impairment cannot be predicted from the patients' physical status.

SU- Distress; Neoplasms; Outpatients; Oncology
AB- Assessed the level, nature, and prevalence of psychological distress in a heterogenous group of 141 patients attending a major Canadian oncology outpatient clinic using the SCL-90. For purposes of comparison, a psychosocial profile was plotted for the psychiatric outpatient norm group reported by L. R. Derogatis (1977). Ss' reported levels of psychological distress were elevated in comparison to the psychiatric outpatient norm group but fell within normal limits. The distribution of scores, however, suggests that about one-third of all oncology outpatients can be expected to experience a high and clinically significant level of psychological distress. Results are discussed in relation to other studies, the limitations of the present study, and the need for better methods of identifying patients in distress. It is concluded that it is important for clinicians to provide patients with a realistic description of the psychosocial sequelae of cancer.

SU- Coping Behavior; Hospice; Medical Personnel; Occupational Stress
AB- Analyzed the responses of 93 22–64 yr old staff members at 3 hospices in relation to 2 outcomes—emotional distress and role fulfillment—that were considered manifestations of occupational stress. Data were obtained from self-administered questionnaires completed at the work site. Results show that Ss called on different resources for coping with various selected problems. Such psychological characteristics and internal resources as self-esteem and a sense of mastery were effective in sustaining Ss against the emotional distress that arose in their work situations. External resources—help and support from others—and cooperative efforts contributed to Ss' feelings of role fulfillment. It is concluded that the special nature of hospice work requires a structured form of interaction among workers who perform similar functions.

KP- principles of intervention
KP- assistance for expression of inner experiences & concerns about illness & death
KP- seriously ill children
SU- Death and Dying; Death Attitudes; Interpersonal Communication; Physical Illness (Attitudes Toward)
AB- Outlines 7 principles of intervention to help seriously ill children express inner experiences and their concerns about serious illness and death, arguing that the perceptions of this population should be ascertained as part of treatment. It is noted that children often use symbolic language to communicate their worries and commonly fantasize that they are responsible for their own illness. Seriously ill children's trust in their parents must be maintained and supported, and their self-esteem can be promoted through mastery. In approaching a child with cancer or any other serious illness, the caretaker should attempt to be free of assumptions so as to be open to what each encounter can teach. Examples of caretakers' interactions with children affected by cancer are provided. (40 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- assessment of psychosocial needs
KP- 11–20 yr old cancer patients
SU- Medical Patients; Needs Assessment; Neoplasms
AB- Nine 11–20 yr old cancer patients in a pediatric oncology program participated in a 3-mo support group led by a pediatrician and a clinical nurse-specialist as part of an assessment program to determine Ss' psychosocial needs. 12 1½-hr sessions were conducted. The topics discussed included the behavior of physicians and nurses (including retaliatory actions), the physician–patient relationship, the reactions of peers and parents to the cancer patient, and reintegration into school and social life. Ss stressed the need for physicians to share personal information with patients and for patients to have positive attitudes toward recovery, to be included in decisions about treatment, and not to be allowed to use their illness. It is concluded that the behavior of health care providers can influence the ability of adolescents to cope with malignancy or chronic illness.

SU- Knowledge Level; Medical Patients; Neoplasms; Peer Relations; Physical Illness (Attitudes Toward)
AB- Administered a 50-item questionnaire to 65 classmates of 11 12–18 yr old cancer patients to study whether patients' feelings of being rejected, avoided, and misunderstood by their peers (classmates) were consistent with reality. Data show a high level of knowledge about cancer and generally positive attitudes and behaviors among peers of patients. These Ss expressed a desire to support and help cancer patients, and they supported the idea of a visiting program for teenagers hospitalized with cancer. Although the question of the discrepancy between cancer patients' and their peers' perceptions needs further investigation, it is suggested that patients' perceptions of rejection by their peers may be biased by depression and the effects of the disease on self-concept.

AB- Investigated the major sources of stress in the work roles of hospice staff members. 93 Ss, aged 22–64 yrs, from 3 hospices participated. 75% were registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and licensed vocational nurses; 25% were social workers, psychologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and directors of volunteers. 92% had some college education. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Findings indicated 3 major stress-producing areas—staff support issues, emotional concern for patients and their families, and management of the disease process. Lack of staff support proved to be the greatest overall producer of stress. (10 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Conducted a study of 145 parents of children who were treated for cancer or blood disorders at a large urban pediatric hospital and who subsequently died, to examine the differences in the parents' experiences. 90 of the Ss were mothers and 55 were fathers; together they represented 92 families. 95% were White, 88% were married, and 65% were employed outside the home. Data were collected either by questionnaire (n = 58) or by interview (n = 87). Both mothers and fathers reported many problems that were unique and could be attributed to their differential roles in the family. Women reported such problems as shielding others, marital problems, concern for the child's morale, and emotional strain. Men reported such problems as feeling responsible for both work and family, exclusion from family, and wife's overinvolvement with the ill child. Implications of the qualitative and quantitative analyses of the data are discussed in relation to the influence of gender on parents' social construction of reality and to anticipatory and postdeath mourning.

SU- Academic Achievement; Blacks; Human Sex Differences; Tobacco Smoking
AB- Conducted a 2-wave study among urban Black adolescents to investigate the link between school achievement and smoking. In the late 1960's (mid-1967 to mid-1969), data were collected from 668 Black teenagers. Six to 8 yrs later (in 1975 and 1976), 536 of the original sample, aged 18–23 yrs, participated in the 2nd study. The 156 Ss who reported smoking at the 1st contact were eliminated from analysis, leaving a pool of 209 males and 171 females. The hypothesis that poor school achievement would have significant influence on the onset of smoking was confirmed. Results indicate that psychogenic variables (worry about school performance) significantly increased the risk of smoking among females but not among males and that perceptions of one's social opportunities, an indicator of differential socialization, added significantly to the risk of smoking among males but not among females.

SU- Human Females; Mastectomy; Rating Scales; Social Adjustment; Test Validity
AB- Tested the discriminate validity of E. Heimler's (1975) social functioning scale by comparing the social functioning scores of 136 women who had had a mastectomy with those of a sample of 147 healthy women. The Ss, aged 25–75 yrs, were administered Heimler's scale of social functioning, a coping response scale, and the Social Readjustment Rating Scale. Ss who had had mastectomies were interviewed from 1 wk to 2½ yrs after surgery. 75% were married, 44% were employed, 28% had regional lymph node involvement at the time of surgery, and 80% had a 2-step procedure. Results show that the Ss who had had mastectomies perceived their social functioning to be less satisfactory than did the controls. They also used more maladaptive coping mechanisms and experienced more life changes, providing evidence of the discriminate validity of Heimler's scale in differentiating mastectomy patients from healthy women.

Particular attention needs to be paid to issues such as depression and anxiety, loss of interests, and damage to self-image. Oncotherapists should be skilled in family therapy techniques and be able to improve communication among family members, incorporate medical staff in therapy when appropriate, and educate family members about the hospital systems they depend on. The importance of leadership skills and issues related to the termination of treatment are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Attempts to sensitize mental health professionals to the special needs of Hispanic families confronted with a diagnosis of childhood cancer. This diagnosis can be especially devastating to the family that lives in another country or in Puerto Rico and brings the child to the US for treatment. Hispanic family structure, culture, and belief systems are discussed using illustrative case vignettes. The Spanish-speaking mental health professional in a cancer-care setting can help the family adjust to its new surroundings by (1) enlisting friends and members of the extended family as sources of emotional support and concrete assistance and (2) educating other staff about the need for flexibility when dealing with the family. Early intervention can help these families adapt to the requirements of the medical institution, cope with diagnosis and treatment, and adjust to a new living environment.

AB- Discusses the uses of hypnosis in the treatment of cancer patients. Four basic methods for the management of pain by hypnosis are outlined: hypnotic analgesia, modification of the painful stimulus, displacement of pain, and dissociation from pain. The value of hypnosis in controlling the physiological concomitants of treatment and the negative psychological effects of cancer are also examined. Hypnotic imagery can be used to induce relaxation, reduce anxiety and distress, and to control anticipatory nausea in chemotherapy. Positive mental imagery helps patients detach themselves from the constant obsession with cancer, allows them to engage in positive goal-directed behavior, and encourages them to think of a more pleasant future. Hypnosis can also bring about changes in perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs that will enhance self-esteem. (22 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- noncategorical approach
KP- psychosocial research of chronic disease
SU- Disorders; Experimentation; Neoplasms
AB- Argues that the attempt to understand the meaning of a disease in the lives of patients and their families requires an approach that considers the commonalities among disease entities rather than the character of the specific disease. The limitations of the disease-specific model are especially noticeable with respect to the psychosocial effects of chronic disease. Several studies of chronic disease in children have indicated that diagnostic groupings provided little information about psychological and social outcomes and that such outcomes were related to the uncertainty or ambiguity of the condition. It is suggested that a noncategorical approach to psychosocial research is necessary to generate the numbers of cases necessary to perform sophisticated analyses of the data.

AB- Describes the development and validation of a screening instrument for predicting the level of emotional distress that newly diagnosed cancer patients may experience 2–6 mo after diagnosis. The initial evaluation consisted of a semistructured interview, psychological testing with the TAT and MMPI, and use of rating scales such as the Profile of Mood States with 120 adult oncology patients. A multiple regression analysis was used to identify the best predictors of emotional distress. After the instrument was developed and calibrated, it was revalidated in a subsequent study of 381 cancer patients, 86% of whom were correctly identified in terms of the predicted level of emotional distress. The limitations and clinical usefulness of this approach are discussed. (10 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Inventories; Needs Assessment; Neoplasms; Test Reliability; Test Validity
AB- Describes an initial study evaluating the psychometric properties of the Cancer Inventory of Problem Situations (CIPS), a newly developed instrument for documenting the psychosocial and physical problems of cancer patients. The CIPS was completed by 306 cancer patients (mean age 60 yrs). 71 Ss completed a 2nd CIPS 1 wk later; 87 Ss completed the SCL-90-R, an index of psychological distress; and 22 Ss participated in a comprehensive interview. The CIPS had excellent test–retest reliability and also correlated highly with the SCL-90-R. Agreement in the types of problems identified by the CIPS and a trained interviewer was also excellent. The CIPS was more sensitive than the interview for assessing problems in 7 categories, including pain, activity, and significant relationships. Content validity was reevaluated and shown to be excellent. The items in the CIPS were factored into subscales of problem categories with alpha coefficients indicating internal consistency. The study indicated that the CIPS is reliable and valid and can be used in clinical settings to assess the problems of individual cancer patients and in research settings to begin documenting the day-to-day problems of patients with different types of cancer.

SU- Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Rating Scales; Self Evaluation; Test Validity
AB- The Anamnestic Comparative Self-Assessment (ACSA) is a method by which cancer patients numerically express their overall subjective level of the quality of life. A personal scale of well-being is constructed around the patient's memory of the best and worst periods in his/her life experience. The method was validated in a pilot study of 65 16–81 yr old patients with various malignancies. The ACSA was sensitive to performance status, prognosis, level of anxiety, and the aggressiveness and results of treatment. The scoring to the ACSA is illustrated via the case of a 59-yr-old male, and the advantages of the ACSA are discussed in terms of its avoidance of observer bias and the comparative nature of the evaluation it provides of the impact of the disease and its treatment.

AB- Presents a conceptual model that maps out the process of coping with the psychosocial stresses of oncology care. The model is taken from crisis theory and is initially presented in a form that describes patients coping with the crises of physical illness. A translation of the model describes the processes involved in coping with the psychosocial stresses of treating physical illness. Emphasis is placed on the adaptive tasks that confront oncology professionals and the coping skills they must use to meet the demands of these adaptive tasks. The tasks are framed in an interpersonal context with the relationships among the self, patient, family members, and other staff as the principal elements. Social support and the development of support groups are defined as the most powerful tools for coping with the ongoing psychosocial stresses of oncology care.

Common physiologic disorders in patients that present as psychosocial distress and questions about mental status that are important in detecting organic mental disorders and the differential evaluation of depressive symptoms are addressed. Issues involved in the use of psychotropic drugs are also summarized. The psychiatrist is placed in the context of a multidisciplinary team and the specific psychiatric contribution to the overall management of cancer patients is described.

AB- 67 32–69 yr old women treated for breast cancer completed a battery of psychological tests to examine which psychological variables contributed most to several indexes of adjustment. Measures included the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale and the Buss-Durkee Hostility-Guilt Inventory. An avoidant style of coping was associated with poorer adjustment on several different indexes, and an active coping style was associated with better adjustment on several indexes. Denial was related to poor adjustment on only 1 index, orientation to health care. Day-to-day stresses were an important predictor of both psychological and domestic adjustment. Health locus of control and the stage and duration of cancer were not related to any adjustment indexes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

Perceived satisfaction with socioemotional support was assessed at treatment onset and at its completion 6 wks later. Ss' responses were used to develop an index of sustained social support. Distress associated with depressive symptoms was assessed at the completion of treatment and 2 mo later using the SCL-90 (Revised). Depression at 2-mo follow-up was not significantly related to level of support after controlling for depression when treatment was completed.

AB- Condensed information about health-related quality of life for patients with breast cancer, obtained using linear analog self-assessment (LASA) scales, into 4 summary scores using factor analysis. Ss included 35 women with histologically established benign breast disease receiving postsurgical follow-up and 60 breast cancer patients undergoing treatment. Three factor scales, incorporating 16 LASA scales related to general health, have been designated Physical, Emotional, and Social Health; the 4th factor scale, Disease-Related, incorporates 11 LASA scales related to breast cancer and its treatment. These factor scales were compared with the Duke-University of North Carolina Health Profile and performed satisfactorily. The factor scales provide a compromise between attempts to condense results into a single overall score and the reporting of results for each LASA scale.

SU- Client Characteristics; Demographic Characteristics; Medical Students; Neoplasms; Student Attitudes
AB- Investigated whether incoming 1st-yr medical students have more negative attitudes toward cancer patients than toward other patient groups and whether their attitudes vary with respect to patients' prognosis, age, and sex. The relation of attitudes and previous experience with cancer was also examined. 323 1st- and 2nd-yr students were administered a description of a patient, with different key words. Five independent variables were manipulated: 4 characteristics of patients and Ss' class year. Evaluative attitudes related to the degree of professional distance that Ss preferred to maintain with different types of patients were assessed on a 6-point Likert scale. Factor analysis of the scale yielded 4 factors used in the data analysis. ANOVA demonstrated Ss' overall preferences for maintaining greater professional distance from cancer patients than from heart patients, and from psychiatric patients than from cancer patients. The analyses also showed that Ss preferred to maintain greater professional distance from patients with a poor prognosis than from patients with a good prognosis and from male patients than from female patients. After 1 yr of medical school, Ss perceived cancer patients as easier to manage. Previous experience with cancer was related to an increased desire to work with cancer patients, but it was also related to a perception of cancer patients as more difficult to manage.

KP- attitudes & behaviors concerning cancer prevention & management
KP- general practitioners vs family practitioners vs internists
SU- Family Physicians; General Practitioners; Internists; Neoplasms; Preventive Medicine
AB- Surveyed 752 primary care physicians in the New York/New Jersey metropolitan area to determine the attitudes and behaviors of different physician groups concerning cancer prevention and management. Results are presented for 165 general practitioners, 177 family practitioners, and 190 internists. Focus was on the cancer prevention behaviors of these Ss in relation to providing advice and literature on smoking cessation, teaching breast self-examination, and instructing patients about the 7 warning signs of cancer. Ss' attitudes about cancer screening and aggressive treatment were also evaluated. In general, a lower percentage of general practitioners provided information about cancer prevention to patients than did family practitioners and internists, although this difference was small in relation to the high level of cancer prevention behaviors reported by all Ss. General practitioners also had significantly more negative attitudes about the efficacy of cancer screening and the value of aggressive treatment for cancer. The possible reasons for these differences are discussed in the context of other group differences, and the implications for cancer prevention programs targeted to the public are reviewed.

AB- Used regression analysis to assess how marital status affected the emotional recovery of 652 mastectomy patients (average age 52 yrs) of different ages. SES, employment, and parental status were used as controls to permit a clearer understanding of how marital status affected Ss' coping with this life crisis. Ss were interviewed and administered the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale 1 yr after undergoing mastectomy. Results indicate that although younger Ss were more likely to fear recurrence of the disease and to worry about disfigurement resulting from surgery, they apparently had resources that protected them against depression. The status of being married, generally believed to be a buffer against stressful life events, was found to afford limited protection at best. Never-married Ss were significantly less likely to worry about recurrence and experience less depression. (58 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes the obstacles to compliance with treatment among cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Some forms that failure to comply may take include delay in seeking treatment, refusal of treatment recommendations, premature termination of treatment, and loss to follow-up after treatment. The possible factors that give rise to difficulties at each stage and the means by which these difficulties may be prevented or managed, including patient education and orientation, attention to patient–staff relationships, awareness of the behavioral and psychological changes that seriously ill patients and their families undergo, accessibility of psychiatric intervention, and use of community resources, are considered. Three case histories of women in their late 50's and 60's are provided, which illustrate typical problems and methods of identifying patients at risk for noncompliance before problems develop.

SU- Adjustment; Client Characteristics; Demographic Characteristics; Family; Neoplasms
AB- Evaluated the records kept by home health agencies on 447 home-bound married cancer patients with breast, lung, or cervical cancer to determine the types of psychosocial problems experienced by the families in home care. Data were collected in a 2-stage record-auditing procedure. The 1st stage consisted of the gathering of relevant sociodemographic and medical data. In the 2nd stage, 2 coders completed the Psychosocial Problem Data Sheet for each S. Results show that families of older male patients with lung cancer felt more overwhelmed and depressed than other families, and families of younger female patients with cervical cancer were more likely to have interpersonal frictions and difficulties in the role shifts mandated by the illness. Implications for intervention based on these findings are discussed. Agencies should provide home services that decrease isolation and increase the sense of support of these families.

KP- fieldwork research with families trying to cope with social & psychological dislocations of serious illness
SU- Coping Behavior; Data Collection; Disorders; Family; Methodology
AB- Discusses fieldwork done with families trying to cope with the social and psychological dislocations caused by serious illness. It is suggested that observing families as they live through this process can provide vital information about what they need at different stages of the process and how the current system for delivering care affects the quality of coping. The fieldwork approach is to begin gathering data soon after the crisis-initiating event (e.g., a diagnosis or an exacerbation of symptoms) and to continue until some event, either in the course of the illness itself or in the family process, signals that a resolution has occurred. Each member of the family is included in the study, as are the primary providers of care. Data are collected both during hospitalization (preferably in the hospital) and at home after discharge. Methods for gaining access, managing the necessary interactions, and handling the postdischarge phase are described. It is concluded that the best data in a family field study are obtained when family members become active participants in the research process. Researchers and their Ss must work to develop mutual understanding and trust, and ways in which researchers can help foster this trust are described.

SU- Drug Therapy; Hospitalized Patients; Neoplasms; Relaxation Therapy; Side Effects (Drug)
AB- 10 42–67 yr old women receiving highly emetic cancer chemotherapy received an experimental clinical relaxation program designed to diminish nausea and vomiting. The experimental protocol consisted of pretreatment education-counseling and use of slow-stroke back massage, guided imagery, and progressive relaxation in concert with continuous attendance and coaching by the investigator during the chemotherapy experience. Results indicate that duration of emetic response, frequency of vomiting, intensity of episodic effort, and volume of emesis were reduced substantially when compared to the known clinical course for patients receiving these agents. Further, a pattern of emetic response characterized by 3 phases was identified. This may provide criteria allowing for more precise patient assessment and improved anti-emetic regimen evaluation. In addition, data gathered provide a base for development of an emetic response rating scale. (37 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Patient visitors bring a special perspective to the increasingly popular spectrum of self-help programs for cancer patients. There is little empirical research; however, of the efficacy of these interventions. The present author contends that research should examine the role of volunteers; locus of responsibility for program coordination; and guidelines for recruitment, screening, training, and continuing education. Findings can be used to develop standardized protocols to ensure that volunteers will be held accountable for their performance. Some benefits and costs of professionally directed patient visiting programs for both cancer patients and volunteer counselors are discussed.

AB- Explored factors predictive of risk of institutionalization in 121 cancer patients (aged 65 yrs or older) referred for visiting nurse services at time of discharge from 3 acute care teaching hospitals. Data on physical condition, psychological, mental, and social variables were collected at discharge and again 4 mo later. Analysis focused on the relationship between medical and psychosocial factors and the risk of rehospitalization or institutionalization in an extended care facility. The speculation that physical disability, psychological and mental factors, community resources, and social support would all influence an elderly cancer patient's risk for institutionalization in a long or short-term care facility was supported. The key factor identified related to the rapidity of physical and functional deterioration. (15 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Studied the effects of family environment on the psychological adjustment of 54 women (average age 54.5 yrs) with metastatic carcinoma of the breast over a 1-yr period. Family environment was assessed using the Family Environment Scale (FES) and a descriptive checklist, and adjustment was measured using the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Ss described their families as supportive and relatively free of conflict, and their spouses or other family members agreed moderately with them. S's mood disturbance during the year was made the dependent variable in a stepwise multiple regression analysis, with FES subscale scores at the beginning of the year and other control variables as predictors. Better adjustment was predicted by more expressiveness and less conflict and moral-religious orientation in the family. Findings indicate that the family is a crucial factor in patient adjustment and that "conspiracies of silence" in the family may be harmful. A clinical illustration is presented.

AB- The development of an integrated body of knowledge and theory in any field of inquiry requires a progression of research studies. The sequence can be conceptualized as proceeding from descriptive studies (usually sparked by clinical insights at the earliest stage of the investigation) to correlational research and then to predictive studies. The present author illustrates this sequence of research stages using an example from psychosocial research in oncology concerning self-help groups of cancer patients. It is concluded that the psychosocial oncology clinician should carefully choose the research design that is appropriate given the state of existing knowledge on the issues being investigated.

AB- A review of the literature indicates that evidence both supports and rejects the view that psychological factors and/or stress are related to increased risk of cancer incidence, relapse, and mortality in humans. Issues relating to genetics and to stress are addressed. Reasons are given why one should be cautious in generalizing to the human case from animal data on stress. Present evidence, including demographic data, suggests that if psychological factors and stress do have an effect on incidence of cancer in the human, it is small. The relationship of psychological factors and stress to cancer prognosis is felt to be more likely. Theoretical speculations about recent relapse and survival findings and associated hypotheses are provided. (85 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Whenever possible, records were obtained for 5 consecutive years: from 1 yr before diagnosis until 3 yrs afterwards. Although patients from both centers had a high rate of absenteeism throughout the 5-yr period, they missed the most days during the year of diagnosis (mean 43 days). However, even 3 yrs after diagnosis, Ss missed significantly more school than did other children in the 2 states. (14 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Among the problems that are increasingly recognized as impediments to clear and effective communications about oncology treatment are the lack of readability of informed consent documents and difficulties in communicating complicated medical instructions orally. Among the techniques for increasing the readability of written communications such as consent forms are the use of short words, simple declarative sentences, and analyses of readability using standard assessment approaches. Strategies for improving patient recall of orally presented information include using specific, definite advice rather than abstract, obscure suggestions and dividing information into 5 distinct components. It is concluded that steps can be taken to increase patients' understanding and comprehension of both written and spoken medical information during oncologic treatment and that findings from psychosocial studies can point out specific guidelines for more effective physician–patient communication.

AB- At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, data were collected on 15 patients who were self-referred for a clinical trial of laetrile. As a group, they appeared to be typical middle-class people: They lived in urban areas, were above average in education, had stable job histories, and had well-developed social-support networks. Some data suggest, however, that this group of patients differed from typical cancer patients in several ways. A substantial proportion did not comply with the recommended treatment; expressed ambivalent, noncommittal, or negative feelings about conventional medical care; and had a history of emotional difficulties. Implications for clinicians are noted. (12 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- The application of principles of behavioral psychology to treat aversion reactions to chemotherapy, fear of medical procedures, and psychosomatic symptoms in adult and pediatric cancer patients represents a broadening of psychosocial oncology's domain. The authors discuss these applications, focusing on theoretical premises of behavioral medicine and on specific clinical examples. Attention is also given to the integration of behavioral medicine within comprehensive cancer treatment. It is argued that this new area of psychosocial oncology provides an effective means of treating previously unaddressed problems and is compatible with other approaches.

AB- Anticipatory grief is a process in which an individual confronted with impending loss initiates the grieving process in anticipation of that event. It is assumed to be a positively adaptive response to expected loss because it provides a person with an opportunity to rehearse the bereaved role and begin working through the profound changes that typically accompany loss, thereby mitigating the trauma associated with actual bereavement. The authors critically review the empirical literature on anticipatory grief and highlight the inconsistent findings about whether the phenomenon exists and whether its effects are beneficial.

AB- Conducted a needs assessment survey among 200 former patients who had been treated for diverse types of cancer to develop a support program for cancer survivors. 45% of Ss were aged 40–60 yrs. Ss reported the greatest level of concern about their (1) general physical health and recurrence of the disease, (2) ability to plan for the future, (3) finances, and (4) general frame of mind. Resources that Ss reported using included family, friends, and hospital professional staff at all levels. 32% of Ss had received no help or information from any source. Results indicate that former cancer patients desire and need additional services and their projected use of such services is high. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Problems resulting from the supposed stigmatizing effects of cancer were reported by fewer than 10% of Ss. Many Ss reported closer family ties and a more positive outlook on life.

Hope should be recognized as crucial to survivorship, and procedures for instilling a sense of hope should be included in the interdisciplinary plan of care. The nursing process (assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, evaluation) is used as a logical, data-based, problem-solving approach to the provision of high quality health care for the patient–family system.

AB- Assessed the relationships among patient satisfaction (SAT), psychosocial status, medical status, and patient-initiated changes in physicians in 128 adult patients who had been recently diagnosed with cancer. Ss were administered the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire, the Profile of Mood States, and the Brief Symptom Inventory. SAT was independent of demographic, clinical, and other psychosocial variables. Although Ss' emotional status changed markedly over time, their SAT with their medical care and treatment remained constant and at high levels. The construct SAT may provide a meaningful measure of patients' adaptation or well-being and may predict undesirable behaviors in cancer patients.

Although significant variations were found in the QLI scores by type of cancer, all Ss scored highest in the support category. The QLI is useful in identifying patterns and areas of need, rather than in making decisions about the care of individual patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Ss' responses to a questionnaire regarding their perceptions of and reactions to the patients revealed more negative perceptions of women with breast or lung cancer compared with heart attack victims. Ss perceived both cancer patients as more depressed and likely to need counseling than the heart attack victim.

AB- 34 females and 16 males who had lost a parent through death during adolescence (mean age 14.9 yrs at time of parental death) were interviewed. All deaths had occurred within 5 yrs and not less than 6 mo before the study was initiated. Half the Ss were members of a peer-support group. All Ss were administered a battery of psychological tests, and answered questions concerning help they received in dealing with their loss. Ss descriptions of helpfulness was scored using a modified version of Gottlieb's (see record [rid]1979-23439-001[/rid]) classification system for informal helping behavior. When asked to describe the types of help received during their bereavement and to rate the usefulness of such help, most Ss reported that a peer (40%) or surviving parent (28%) had been most helpful, primarily through emotionally supportive behavior. The source of support had often influenced the style of support and Ss' perceptions of its value. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined feelings of loneliness in various life situations among young adult cancer patients. Ss (aged 19–45 yrs) were divided into the following groups: 27 patients diagnosed within the previous 3 mo, 33 patients diagnosed from 1–3 yrs prior to the study who were in remission and not receiving treatment, and 38 controls. Ss completed a brief demographic questionnaire and the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale and responded to an open-ended question about loneliness. Unmarried Ss expressed higher levels of loneliness than did all other Ss. Approximately half the patients felt lonely in illness-related situations, whereas no healthy S expressed that reaction. Implications of the study for psychosocial professionals who work with cancer patients are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Adjustment; Coping Behavior; Neoplasms; Social Support
AB- Investigated social support (SP), sense of control (SC), and coping behavior (CB) in relation to patients' adaptation to cancer, as well as relations between SP, and several variables: SC, CB, characteristics of the illness, and severity of noncancer-related stressors. Among 369 Ss (aged 35–85 yrs) 168, 51, and 75 were breast, lung, and colorectal cancer patients, respectively. Ss were administered the following measures within 3–6 mo after the diagnosis of cancer: a modified version of the Interview Schedule for Social Interaction; a 5-item scale to assess Ss' sense of mastery; items that reflect reliance on religion; cognitive restructuring items; and a mental health inventory. Results indicated significant independent associations between SP and SC and adaptation that underscore the need to examine SP and SC within an overall structure of coping with serious illness.

SU- Neoplasms; Occupational Adjustment; Quality of Work Life; Testes
AB- 74 patients with cancer of the testis (aged 19–59 yrs) who had completed treatment 2–20 yrs before the study completed a work-related questionnaire, a scale to measure work satisfaction, the profile of mood states, and a scale to measure whether patients believed that men should conceal emotions. The cancer experience did not seriously disrupt their ability to work, job mobility, or career plans. Work may serve an important psychological function after treatment and for a subgroup of survivors, it may provide a means of managing depression and anxiety.

AB- Investigated the ability of the Family Adaptability-Cohesion Evaluation Scale (FACES II; D. H. Olson et al, see record [rid]1980-27831-001[/rid]) to predict in 80 families of cancer patients (aged 14–63 yrs), those families likely to engage in conflict with medical staff (sensitivity) and those families not likely to engage in conflict with staff (specificity). 40 families were involved in a retrospective analysis, and 40 families were involved in a prospective analysis. Following a patient's discharge or death, staff judged whether a family had demonstrated any of 6 behaviors likely to lead to conflict with staff during the patient's hospitalization. FACES II demonstrated sensitivity superior to its specificity. Although FACES II predicted all families that actually came into conflict with staff, it also predicted that more than twice as many families would generate conflict.

KP- 20–70 yr old females with early breast cancer
SU- Breast Neoplasms; Choice Behavior; Emotional Adjustment; Mastectomy; Surgery
AB- 59 women (aged 20–70 yrs) with early breast cancer were offered the choice of a mastectomy, lumpectomy plus radiotherapy, or entry in a trial in which the allocation to either type of treatment was randomized. Other patients, for whom it was decided that a mastectomy was the only viable treatment on medical grounds, were offered breast reconstruction. Psychosocial adaptation was measured using tests of anxiety, depression, marital adjustment, body satisfaction, self-esteem, sociability, and life change. It was found that Ss who rated high in the degree of concern about appearance (i.e., the younger patients) tended to choose conservative surgery or reconstruction when a mastectomy was necessary. Generally, the adjustment to treatment was good in all the groups. Tailoring the treatment to Ss' preferences resulted in low psychological morbidity.

SU- Emotional Adjustment; Neoplasms; Radiation Therapy; Treatment Termination
AB- Compared the psychosocial status of 15 patients (aged 18–45 yrs) with early-stage Hodgkin's disease who had completed radiation therapy within the previous 2 yrs with the status of 28 age-matched patients with early-stage disease who had completed the same treatment more than 2 years earlier. Measures used include the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale, and the SCL-90. The 2 groups differed on attitudes toward their interpersonal relationships with their physicians. The impact of the cancer experience may have had a subtle effect on patient's psychosocial well-being (based on uncertainty about long-term survival) lasting long after treatment has ended. Conceptualization of the long-term survivor is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined the role of employment in coping with a chronic illness by administering a questionnaire assessing mood states and coping strategies to 104 men diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia. Comparisons were drawn between Ss who were employed, had left the workplace voluntarily, and had left the workplace involuntarily. Tensions and depression proved to be significantly higher in the involuntarily unemployed work group than in the other 2 groups, and these Ss tended to use emotionally focused coping strategies more often than the others. Findings suggest that the denial of the opportunity to work after a diagnosis of cancer may affect patients' overall adjustment to their illness.

AB- Examined the effects of attributed control over personal health and experienced meaning of personal status on anxiety and self-esteem in 57 advanced cancer patients (aged 21–79 yrs). The extent to which Ss attributed meaning to their situation was a significant predictor of both higher self-esteem and lower anxiety. However, neither externalized control nor longer experience with cancer predicted levels of either anxiety or self-esteem. Results suggest that a sense of meaning in late-stage disease is an important focus for therapeutic exchange. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Presents a conceptual model that maps out the process of coping with the psychosocial stresses of oncology care. The model is taken from crisis theory and is initially presented in a form that describes patients coping with the crises of physical illness. A translation of the model describes the processes involved in coping with the psychosocial stresses of treating physical illness. Emphasis is placed on the adaptive tasks that confront oncology professionals and the coping skills they must use to meet the demands of these adaptive tasks. The tasks are framed in an interpersonal context with the relationships among the self, patient, family members, and other staff as the principal elements. Social support and the development of support groups are defined as the most powerful tools for coping with the ongoing psychosocial stresses of oncology care.

AB- Reviewed the literature to identify coping issues and factors associated with family functioning when a family member has cancer and to relate these to specific issues that arise when breast cancer occurs. The approaches to assessment and intervention also were examined. Most studies placed primary emphasis on the patient's problems rather than on the family's, and assessment and intervention models were generally aimed toward chronic illness and all cancers. There is a need to understand how the specific factors affect families and to identify high-risk families who cannot adjust successfully. It is concluded that further research should compare families who enhance their lives by coping well with those who cope dysfunctionally. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Studied the relationship between level of social support (SS) during a life-threatening health crisis and subsequent amelioration of psychological distress (i.e., the stress buffering hypothesis). 181 patients (aged 18–83 yrs) who had recently been diagnosed with cancer and were about to undergo radiation therapy were followed through 2 mo posttreatment. Perceived satisfaction with SS was assessed at the onset of treatment and at its completion 6 wks later. Ss' responses were used to develop an index of sustained SS. Distress associated with depressive symptoms was assessed at the completion of treatment and 2 mo later using the SCL-90 (Revised). Depression at the 2-mo follow-up was not significantly related to level of SS after controlling for depression when treatment was completed.

AB- Reviews the identification and management of 2 common psychiatric disorders in cancer patients: delirium and depression. Physical consequences of cancer and its treatment can account for disorders of mood, thought, or behavior that appear indistinguishable from psychological, social, behavioral, or existentially mediated distress. Recognizing a medical basis for psychosocial distress is important because (1) the impairment often has a specific, treatable cause and (2) the failure to treat may lead to premature loss of function. Common physiologic disorders in patients that present as psychosocial distress are reviewed, and issues involved in the use of psychotropic drugs are summarized.

Three of these factor scales, incorporating 16 LASA scales related to general health, were designated Physical, Emotional, and Social Health; the 4th factor scale, termed Disease-Related, incorporated 11 LASA scales related to breast cancer and its treatment. These factor scales were compared with an established instrument for assessing health status, the Duke-University of North Carolina Health Profile, and were found to perform satisfactorily.

KP- literature review
SU- Literature Review; Neoplasms; Psychodynamics
AB- Reviews recent empirical literature on childhood cancer, especially the data-based psychological studies published during the past 5 yrs. Studies are delineated into 4 primary areas: psychosocial functioning of the child and his or her family, adherence to therapeutic regimens, nausea and vomiting, and pain from diagnostic and treatment procedures. It is suggested that future research should involve large-scale prospective longitudinal studies, based on the collaboration of many cancer centers, that utilize multivariate statistical procedures.

SU- Early Experience; Family Planning Attitudes; Marriage Attitudes; Neoplasms; Recovery (Disorders)
AB- Compared interview data from 263 adult survivors of childhood cancer and 369 adult sibling controls regarding their decisions to marry and have children. The survivors were more likely to report not marrying for health reasons. Although the long-term survivors did not have significantly more documented or suspected infertility problems, they were less likely than controls to have been pregnant or involved with a pregnancy and were more likely to have been advised by a physician to avoid a pregnancy. When the frequency of birth defects among 253 offspring of the survivors was compared with the frequency of defects among 595 offspring of controls, the outcome of pregnancy among survivors and controls proved to be equally favorable.

KP- concepts & assessment of depression
KP- cancer patients
SU- Major Depression; Neoplasms
AB- Discusses 2 types of disordered mood, both called depression, and emphasizes the need to distinguish between them to provide effective therapy. The 1st type is psychogenic and can be understood through knowledge of the person's personality and past and present experiences; this type can be treated with counseling and psychotherapeutic approaches. The 2nd kind is biogenic; this is an illness to be considered within the medical context and that usually responds to antidepressant drugs but is resistant to psychological treatment. It is suggested that distinguishing between the 2 types is particularly difficult in instances of chronic, painful illnesses. The use of depression rating scales and mood disorder scales is discussed as an aid in distinguishing between these 2 types of depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Investigated 26 pairs of mothers and fathers of pediatric cancer patients to explore the relationship between parental communication patterns and parental psychological well-being and possible differences between the communication styles of mothers and fathers. Results indicate that, for mothers, open and frequent communication had a positive effect on emotional well-being, and spousal communication was particularly important. In comparison with fathers, mothers had significantly more positive perceptions of the family's overall emotional climate, evaluated the patient as significantly better adjusted, and communicated significantly more often and openly with the patient.

AB- Reviews the literature (over 200 clinical papers and research studies) published between 1966 and 1986 that focuses on communication dimensions of the cancer experience. The review analyzes communication issues from 3 perspectives: the patient, the health professional, and the family. The literature indicates that the major communication issues for patients are related to maintaining a sense of control, seeking information, disclosing feelings, and searching for meaning. For health professionals, the primary communication issues center on imparting information, communicating hope, and sharing control. Major issues facing family members pertain to the concealment of feelings, acquiring information, and coping with helplessness. A methodological critique of the literature is also provided.

Employers' practices toward employees who develop cancer and in hiring former cancer patients are addressed, and health care providers' practices regarding employment of survivors are noted. State and federal laws provide a potential source of help for the person who does develop problems. The authors postulate that improved survival rates and current publicity and openness about cancer are serving to ameliorate the cancer patient's employment problems.

AB- Interviewed 78 breast cancer patients and their significant others to assess perceptions of social support following a diagnosis of cancer. Results indicate that supportive close relationships during and after an episode of cancer were associated with positive patient adjustment. The evidence suggested that most cancer patients can expect that support to be forthcoming. Approximately three-quarters of the 78 patients in the present study reported that their relationships, including those with family and friends, continued to be warm and helpful after the cancer episode. The remaining one-fourth had at least 1 troubled relationship, and many more experienced isolated instances of rejection or withdrawal. Strained communication was a common problem in this group, particularly when the patient felt that her fears were discounted by those close to her.

AB- Investigated 25 adult cancer patients and 32 healthy control Ss to determine the impact of living with incurable cancer on psychological distress, sleep, physical abilities, quality of life, marital distress, patterns of daily living, and fund of illness-related information. It was hypothesized that cancer patients would have higher levels of psychological distress, more impaired physical abilities, poorer quality of life, and more marital distress than would the healthy controls because of the deleterious effects of cancer. It was also hypothesized that the cancer patients would be less physically active, spend more time alone in passive activities, and spend less time in work and recreational activities. Findings show that, although the results indicate considerable support for these hypotheses, the patients appeared to be less distressed and more active than anticipated.

AB- Administered psychological tests and structured interviews to 42 survivors of childhood cancer to assess their psychosocial adjustment. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) was administered to each survivor, and the Personality Inventory for Children was administered to the parents. The Q-sort technique was used to assess the degree of psychopathology of each MMPI profile. 33% of the survivors exhibited clinical evidence of at least a moderate degree of emotional difficulty. The structured interviews and MMPI test results revealed agitation, restlessness, social withdrawal, and passivity as frequent behavioral difficulties. Parents' reports of their children's personalities were highly correlated with the survivors' MMPI profiles. The development of age-appropriate independent tasks appeared to be most difficult for survivors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Describes childhood cancer as a series of chronic, uncontrollable, and stressful life events that may have lasting impact on survivors and their families. Several risk factors are discussed that increase the child and family's vulnerability to maladjustment: (1) the severity and spacing of medical and other life stresses; (2) iatrogenic physical impairment; (3) social stigma; and (4) an interrelated cluster of poverty, ethnicity, and a single-adult family structure. Three sources of invulnerability to maladjustment (individual coping style, family functioning, and social support) may increase resiliency in the face of stress and thus reduce the risk of long-term dysfunction. The risk of psychological maladjustment points to the need for preventive family-focused intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Studied psychosocial effects of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) among 15 pediatric patients (aged 2 and a half to 16 yrs) and their families. Assessment procedures proved to be acceptable to patients, parents, and siblings, and the research methods proved to be feasible. Before BMT, the majority of the parents showed depressive symptoms, whereas most of the children were relatively well adjusted. During treatment, patients exhibited behavioral and emotional changes. Since some family members were separated from the family in all families, the parents' and siblings' ability to cope was affected. New behavior problems occurred far more frequently among siblings who were bone marrow donors than among the other siblings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- female breast cancer patients
SU- Breast Neoplasms; Decision Making; Mastectomy; Surgery
AB- 43 women with breast cancer received either mastectomy or lumpectomy plus radiotherapy. Whenever medically feasible, the Ss were allowed to choose their own treatment. When they needed help in deciding, an informal decision analysis based on the principles of Bayesian decision analysis was conducted to help them choose. Those who needed a mastectomy were offered breast reconstruction. Tests of anxiety, depression, body satisfaction, marital adjustment, self-esteem, sociability, and life change were administered to the Ss before surgery and at intervals up to 1 yr after treatment to assess their psychological adaptation to treatment. Psychological adaptation has been good in all groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Discusses the use of hypnotherapy in conjunction with psychotherapy to ameliorate disease- and treatment-related symptoms in 12 adult cancer patients. Reasons for S referral were nausea, vomiting, anxiety, depression, anorexia, and pain. Hypnotherapy included trance induction, total body relaxation, visualization, and use of hypnotic suggestion to facilitate removal of noxious symptoms. The mean number of psychotherapy sessions was 9, and the mean number of hypnotherapy sessions was 4. Nine Ss received hypnotherapy because psychotherapy and other modalities had failed to relieve their symptoms; 3 received it for relief of symptoms and supportive therapy. Most of the Ss were terminally ill. Hypnotherapy was successful in relieving symptoms in 8 of the 12 Ss. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Neoplasms; Prediction; Psychometrics; Psychosocial Factors; Testes
AB- Reviews several representative studies that attempt to predict the onset or progression of testicular cancer from psychological variables and reviews the psychometric and conceptual issues they raise. Assessment measures discussed include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Personal Orientation Inventory, and Derogatis Sexual Functioning Inventory. It is argued that this research strategy, although sometimes interesting from a scientific perspective, consists of the implicit adoption of the medical model into psychosocial oncology research. The utility of this model from the perspectives of the researcher and the patient is questioned. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Investigated depressive symptoms of 53 newly diagnosed adult cancer patients receiving radiation therapy and the relationship of these symptoms to P. M. Lewinsohn's (1974, 1982) behavioral model of depression. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Over 75% of the Ss were not depressed. Analyses were consistent with Lewinsohn's model. Unpleasant and pleasant events cross-products accounted for a significant amount of variance in BDI scores. The subscales of unpleasant events most strongly correlated with depression were (1) perceptions that others were dissatisfied with them, (2) perceptions that others were infringing on them, and (3) concerns over poor work performance. The subscales of pleasant events that inversely correlated most strongly with depression were feelings of good health and leisure-time activities.

Nutritional support was maintained by intravenous hyperalimentation (IVH) at home, which seemed contraindicated. However, the S had 18 mo of totally uneventful IVH, with good weight gain and a quality of life that was fully acceptable to him and his family. This case is discussed in the light of 2 differing perceptions of IVH.

KP- moral conflicts in cancer treatment
KP- role of physicians & patients
SU- Morality; Neoplasms; Therapeutic Processes; Treatment
AB- Asserts that moral disagreements in cancer care are operationally similar to moral disagreements in the care of patients with other diseases. Conflicts between individuals tend to reflect the morally pluralistic character of the environment where health care is provided. By engaging in moral analysis or reflection, these conflicts may be better understood and perhaps resolved. Thus, ethics may engender mutual respect and clarify points at which disputants agree, resulting in a continual clinical relationship. Three case vignettes illustrate how conflicts grounded in moral disagreement can arise in the care of people who have cancer, and how fundamental moral differences can affect clinical relationships.

KP- social desirability & impact on quality of life assessment
KP- 34–75 yr old chemotherapy patients with advanced colorectal vs bladder cancer
SU- Bladder; Colon Disorders; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Social Desirability
AB- 81 patients (aged 34–75 yrs) undergoing chemotherapy for advanced cancer (41 Ss had colorectal cancer, 40 had bladder cancer) participated in a comparative study of social desirability (SOD). Among other psychometric tests, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCS) was used to assess SOD. A 2-sample t-test showed no significant difference in mean MCS scores between the 2 groups, but both mean scores were substantially higher than those found in samples of the general population. It is suggested that since the ages of Ss in the present study clustered around the median of 60.6 for colorectal cancer and 62.5 for bladder cancer, it is probable that the high SOD observed was due in part to advanced age but also in part to having cancer.

Results show that support was significantly related to psychological distress as well as to change in distress. The coping strategies of wishfulfilling fantasy (WFF) self-blaming denial, and emotional expression were significantly related to greater distress; WFF was significantly related to change in distress. Results indicate that the spouse's support serves a beneficial function for lung cancer patients in ameliorating psychological distress and that WFF is a detrimental strategy for coping with psychological distress.

AB- Assessed the needs of 71 acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients and 7 family members for psychosocial services, the extent of their use of such services, and the level of their satisfaction with services received from community-based service organizations. Patients expressed the need for many kinds of services, including those that provide medical information, medical referrals, and practical help as well as support groups and individual therapy. Although most patients were satisfied with the services they had used, they were most satisfied with individual therapy and with services that provided transportation, food, and clothing. Results show that community organizations that serve AIDS patients should provide a wide range of psychosocial services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Sex-role theory was used to explain how factors related to the male role complicate men's adjustment. Ss placed a high priority on their wives' adjustment but kept their own feelings at bay. Ss' adoption of a "protective guardian" role during their wives' hospitalization fostered denial and later blocked communication between spouses. Questionnaire data indicate that support group members became significantly more communicative with spouses about mastectomy issues than did control group members. These quantitative findings parallel clinical observations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer are increasingly given the choice of mastectomy or lumpectomy and radiation therapy as primary treatment. It is suggested that high-quality provision of health care should include attention to psychosocial as well as medical issues during this decision-making process. Six case examples are used to demonstrate the importance of exploration of feelings during this period to facilitate a decision that may be satisfactory psychologically as well as medically.

AB- Reviews the literature regarding the following choices that cancer patients make about treatment: (1) to continue with recommended regimens, (2) to comply with those regimens or seek other opinions from within the health care system, or (3) to try unproven methods of treatment. It is noted that clinical research is needed to establish the prevalence of patient noncompliance and use of unproven treatments as well as to ascertain the reasons behind patients' actions. Understanding the cancer patient's motivations for decisions can contribute to more effective clinical practice and to modification of the cancer care system so that it is more responsive to patients' needs.

AB- Nausea and vomiting that occur before or during a chemotherapy infusion is called conditioned or anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV). The 3-systems model of emotion is proposed as a heuristic device for the development of assessment procedures for ANV and chemotherapy-related anxiety; this model could facilitate the matching of the response patterns of individual patients with available treatment interventions. The construct of anxiety is discussed, a mode-by-method matrix for classifying assessment procedures is introduced, and current assessment procedures for ANV are reviewed.

AB- Presents a conceptual framework for studying the impact of childhood cancer on the psychosocial and social functioning of the patient and the family. A literature-based model about coping with stress, and 2 psychosocial theories of human behavior—attribution and social comparison theory—are presented. The model (1) describes problems people experience when confronted with a threatening situation; (2) provides a classification of problems that has a manageable number of categories to which problems can be assigned; and (3) gives insight into some important coping strategies that children and their parents use to lessen the impact of those problems. The problem categories and coping strategies of the model are illustrated from findings described in the literature and from information obtained during interviews with patients and parents.

Three examples are presented to illustrate the effect of the family's organization on the process of adaptation and the appropriate clinical responses to 2 types of families—the enmeshed family and the disengaged family. The principles of clinical intervention with a family in which a member has cancer are summarized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- 53 patients (mean age 62 yrs) with inoperable lung cancer were interviewed 1 and 2 mo postdiagnosis to obtain data on their level of symptom distress, as well as on selected psychosocial and demographic variables. Ss were then followed for about 4 yrs, at which time 45 had died of lung cancer, 2 had died of other causes, 4 remained alive, and 2 were lost to follow-up. Ss' postdiagnosis symptom distress score was the most important predictor of survival (from among 8 variables considered) after adjusting for age, functional status, and personality traits. Thus, the magnitude of symptoms that patients report soon after diagnosis may influence how long they live. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examined 3 questions via 2 studies with 225 undergraduates and 612 nurses (aged 23–75 yrs): (1) Do people make different causal explanations for cancer than for other illnesses? (2) Are the causal explanations people make related to other perceptions of the patients? (3) Is blame for an illness associated with other perceptions of the patient? The students judged cancer to be caused less by person-related factors than are some other illnesses, although they linked personal responsibility with other negative perceptions of the cancer patient and reported a greater inclination to avoid cancer patients whom they perceived to be responsible for their illness. The nurses indicated a similar pattern, except they did not link personal responsibility for etiology with avoidance of cancer patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

Ss met weekly in group sessions led by therapists in a manner designed to address each category of psychosocial problems. The major outcome variables measured were affect and pain. As compared with women who did not receive intervention, group members experienced significant reductions in mood disturbance and in the reactive component of pain, although the frequency and duration of pain attacks were similar in both groups.

KP- psychological distress & coping
KP- female vs male patients receiving definitive radiotherapy for cancer
SU- Coping Behavior; Distress; Human Sex Differences; Neoplasms; Radiation Therapy
AB- Assessed psychological distress in 181 patients (aged 17+ yrs) who were receiving definitive radiotherapy for cancer to determine whether there was evidence that men and women differ in initial psychological need and the effectiveness of their coping in the absence of any programmatic intervention. In repeated psychometric assessments, patients reported significantly less depression and anxiety after treatment, although depressive symptoms were still higher than nonpatient norms for both sexes in the 3-mo period between the onset of treatment and second follow-up interview. There were no apparent differences between the men and women in reduction of psychic distress, which indicates that the men and women were equally effective in coping with their disease and treatment.

KP- compliance with dental fluoridation program
KP- patients irradiated for head & neck cancer
SU- Dental Treatment; Neoplasms; Radiation Therapy; Treatment Compliance
AB- Describes a 2-yr randomized trial to compare the efficacy of fluoride gel and fluoride toothpaste. 220 patients irradiated for head and neck cancer had an overall compliance rate of 93% with the dental program. Though the difference was not significant, the fluoride gel group had a slightly higher compliance rate than the fluoride toothpaste group. The compliance behavior is interpreted using the health belief model and learning theories, and suggestions are offered for future research. It is concluded that new health behaviors that can be incorporated into existing habituated stimulus-response sequences are likely to result in long-term maintenance of those behaviors and yield high compliance rates among patients.

SU- Grief; Group Counseling; Immunologic Disorders; Male Homosexuality; Social Support
AB- Explores the issue of psychosocial support for persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) by describing experiences with a group that offers support to persons with AIDS and to their significant others. 32 men (aged 32–64 yrs) attended the grief recovery group (GRG) under the auspices of the AIDS Project Los Angeles over an 18-mo period. Most had lost a partner to the effects of AIDS. Although feelings of grief are similar among all people experiencing a loss, the unique needs of this population became obvious. Social stigma, homophobia, fear of contracting the disease or of being a carrier, and special reentry and dating problems are only a few of the concerns that complicate their grief. Traditional and nontraditional grief groups are compared, and the authors' experiences from the GRG are described. It is concluded that to become more effective, caregivers must be willing to recognize and resolve their personal feelings about loss and homosexuality.

KP- aspects of denial
KP- patients with cancer
KP- treatment implications
SU- Client Attitudes; Denial; Neoplasms; Treatment
AB- Discusses the concept of denial in cancer patients and considers ways of establishing its presence and distinguishing it from other mechanisms. An exploratory study of 15 cancer patients (mean age 65.7 yrs) exhibiting extreme denial resulted in the delineation of 4 major aspects of denial: (1) denial of the physical manifestations of the disease; (2) denial of the diagnosis; (3) denial of the implications of the illness; and (4) denial, or isolation, of affect associated with the illness. Since denial can be adaptive or maladaptive, specification of the type of denial a patient manifests and its adaptive or maladaptive functions aid in the decision to try to reduce or modify the denial. It is suggested that denial be viewed from the standpoints of its relationship to help-seeking behavior, compliance with medical treatment, psychological well-being vs mood disturbance, and the capacity to sustain needed social support.

AB- Assessed the emotional and psychosocial status of 102 patients (aged 20+ yrs) who had a recurrence of 1 of 6 types of cancer: breast, colon, lung, gynecologic, Hodgkin's disease, or malignant melanoma. Ss contrasted their current experience with their experience at the initial diagnosis. Test scores, personality inventories, and common clinical characteristics such as stage of disease were also used in the comparisons. Although recurrence is an ominous development, no research evidence was found that it is actually more distressing and menacing than the 1st diagnosis.

KP- implications for health education
SU- Anxiety; Health Attitudes; Human Females; Knowledge Level; Neoplasms
AB- Measured anxiety about cancer, prior experience with cancer, knowledge of cancer, attitudes toward health, and intentions to engage in preventive behavior in 479 Dutch women who, because of their age, had been invited to participate in mass screenings to detect cervical cancer. The Dutch version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to validate the fear-of-cancer measure. Ss with a low level of fear of cancer knew more about the disease, had greater intentions to behave preventively and a lesser estimation of their chance of getting the disease, and felt that cancer was less threatening than did those with higher levels of anxiety. Prior experiences with cancer were related to a greater knowledge of the disease and Ss' higher estimation of their chance of getting it. Health educators may have a more difficult time reaching persons who have a low educational level and a high level of anxiety about cancer because these 2 factors seem to inhibit the acceptance of information about health.

SU- Breast Neoplasms; Early Experience; Emotions; Mother Child Relations; Uterus
AB- A consecutive series of 72 women (31–70 yrs old) presenting symptoms suggesting cancer (26 breast lumps and 46 abnormal uterine bleeding) completed the Family Attitude Questionnaire (FAQ) on the day they were admitted to the hospital. The total cancer group had lower scores than the total benign group on the following scales: Closeness to Parents, Demonstrativity, Good Paternal Relationship, Paternal Demonstrativity, and Good Maternal Relationship. When the patients were separated according to tumor site, the uterine cancer group reported lower scores on the Closeness to Parents, Good Paternal Relationship, and Paternal Demonstrativity scales than did patients with benign lesions. Unlike the controls, the breast cancer patients showed negative attitudes toward the mother only (Good Maternal Relationship and Maternal Demonstrativity subscales). It is concluded that some complex association exists between cancer and the affective and emotional climate in the family during early childhood.

SU- Interviews; Needs Assessment; Neoplasms; Rehabilitation; Screening Tests
AB- Describes a comprehensive approach to needs assessment for cancer patients that was developed to provide specific rehabilitation interventions. 24 patients (aged 25–73 yrs) were evaluated independently using a comprehensive, structured interview and the Cancer Inventory of Problem Situations (CIPS) by R. L. Heinrich et al (see record [rid]1985-00151-001[/rid]). General content areas and specific items from both instruments were compared for each patient, and a rate of agreement between the 2 instruments was calculated. The instruments showed a high rate of agreement for physical and treatment-related problems; however, the rate of agreement was lower for more personal and sensitive areas such as marital distress, finances, and sexual dysfunction. Overall, the CIPS appeared to be a more sensitive screening instrument for rehabilitation needs, but the personal interview provided useful background information and can be used as a companion to the CIPS.

KP- psychosocial & demographic characteristics & extent of surgery & therapy
KP- esophageal or electrolaryngeal speech or nonverbal methods of communication after laryngectomy

SU- Demographic Characteristics; Larynx; Oral Communication; Recovery (Disorders); Surgery
AB- Identified variables that discriminated among methods of communication, using 60 patients (primarily aged 54–65 yrs) who had experienced total laryngectomies from 5 mo to 3 yrs 6 mo earlier. Data were collected on support from family, friends, and other laryngectomees; characteristics of the voice therapy experience; extent of surgery; time since surgery; and demographic characteristics. Support from family and friends and time spent practicing esophageal speech made significant contributions to differences among all 3 methods: esophageal or electrolaryngeal speech and nonverbal methods. Ss using nonverbal communication had the most extensive disease and were discriminated on the basis of the time since surgery. (29 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

KP- cancer-prone families
SU- At Risk Populations; Family; Health Care Services; Neoplasms; Preventive Medicine
AB- Describes a clinic and research service operating since 1981, designed primarily to provide genetic and medical information that will facilitate primary as well as secondary prevention of cancer among individuals who are at greater than average risk for developing the disease because of a family history of cancer. The services provided by the clinic are discussed from 3 standpoints: (1) the clinic population and the structure of the clinic service, (2) specific informational and psychological needs or concerns that clients present and how the staff addresses those needs, and (3) psychosocial barriers that interfere with the clinic's goals and suggestions for circumventing those barriers. The suggestion is made that the clinic's structure could be adapted for health maintenance organizations where the emphasis is on prevention and where multiple disciplines are already represented among the staff.

SU- Breast Neoplasms; Client Characteristics; Emotional Adjustment; Ovaries; Social Support
AB- Explored the role of social support in ameliorating the stressful effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment in 357 patients, aged 20–54 yrs, with female reproductive cancer. Ss were asked (1) what types of supportive persons were available (e.g., spouse, friends, relatives, children) and the level of support these persons had provided since the cancer had developed (social support network), (2) whether various socioemotional and instrumental tasks were beneficial (social support), and (3) whether Ss were experiencing marital difficulties or felt isolated or lonely (effects of stress). Results indicate that the husband was the most important member of the support network for married Ss and that relatives were the most important member for single Ss. Few felt isolated or lonely or reported stress in their marriages because of the cancer. The most beneficial type of support activity was socioemotional—listening to or talking with the patient about the disease. Other beneficial social support behaviors varied according to marital status, age, and socioeconomic factors. (45 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

The most prevalent symptoms were anxiety and somatic concern, followed by depression, substance abuse, and hypomania. Symptoms seemed to be associated with basic personality structure. Data do not support the hypothesis. (6 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Hospital Programs; Hospitalized Patients; Neoplasms; Play Therapy
AB- Discusses the therapeutic play group program developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"s 42-bed pediatric unit that is used to educate the patients (aged 2.5–12 yrs) about their illness and treatment; to enhance their compliance with the medical treatment; and to help them cope with their diagnosis, treatment, and hospitalization. The program focuses on prevention, involves co-leadership by a social worker and a nurse, and integrates what is learned in the group into the patients" care plans. The approach to play therapy utilized in this program places equal emphasis on (1) teaching and education, (2) addressing the children"s perception of their illness by dealing directly with the symbolic content of play, and (3) establishing an atmosphere of normality for the children. Common clinical issues encountered in the groups are discussed, and case examples are presented that illustrate the important functions of play in the intellectual and emotional lives of children.

SU- Coping Behavior; Hyperthermia; Neoplasms; Pain Perception; Physical Treatment Methods
AB- Discusses hyperthermia, which is the artificial inducement of abnormally high blood temperature designed to cause tumor tissue to retain heat and which has additive or synergistic effects with radiation and chemotherapy. Because of the clinically administered high temperature, cancer patients often experience pain and discomfort. 30 cancer patients, aged 24–70 yrs, undergoing hyperthermia treatment as part of their overall cancer care were administered the Millon Behavioral Health Inventory to determine which of them were able to tolerate the hyperthermia regimen. It was found that the Ss who were more hopeful about the future, less sensitive, more cooperative, more forceful, less responsive to pain, and less emotionally reactive were more tolerant of the hyperthermia treatment. The data also suggest that Ss who were less anxious and relied on coping styles characterized by a greater locus of internal control were able to tolerate discomfort better. It is suggested that any intervention that reduces anxiety (e.g., cognitive reinterpretation) also reduces the subjective intensity of pain.

Five months later (Time 2), 29 of the 45 surviving Ss and their spouses again completed the instruments on family role, marital communication, and family environment. It was found that families who used achieved rather than ascribed role-assignment methods before the onset of cancer, families with older children who could adopt expanded role functions, and families with more interspouse communication experienced less disruption, less role conflict, and less role strain over time. Recommendations for helping cancer patients and their families cope more effectively with the stress of cancer and its treatment are presented.

SU- Emotional Adjustment; Immunologic Disorders; Self Esteem; Social Adjustment; Social Support
AB- Studied the psychosocial status of 21 homosexual or bisexual male outpatients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex and measured their self-reported demographic characteristics, social support, self-esteem, mood state, and psychosocial needs. Ss manifested a marked mood disturbance, and one-third reported low self-esteem. Ss also indicated that the devastating effects of AIDS on their work life were secondary to their great fatigue, the effects of the medical treatment, and the effects of the illness on their physical appearance. In addition, they reported diminished social interactions since the onset of their illness, but they did not report any relationship disturbances with family members. Profound illness-related psychosocial stress was also reported. Further research may reveal that there are psychosocial and physical phases of the illness of AIDS, as there are in cancer, and that premorbid psychosocial characteristics of Ss may help discriminate those who are at risk for developing emotional distress during the illness.

KP- sociodemographic characteristics & length & context of interviews
KP- scores on depression scale & responses to attitudinal questions
KP- females who had vs had not undergone mastectomy
SU- Depression (Emotion); Human Females; Interviews; Mastectomy; Measurement
AB- Discusses the reasons for the conflicting results of a study of the recovery of 652 women (mean age 52.4 yrs) who had undergone a mastectomy, in which the respondents' mean score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES—D) was 3 points lower (indicating less depression) than the mean score of a sample of 433 women (mean age 45.8 yrs) from the general population interviewed as a comparison group. The social and demographic characteristics of the 2 groups were similar, as were the Ss' responses to other attitudinal questions. In addition, patterns of association between variables were similar in both populations. Because the only difference between the 2 groups of Ss was in their responses on the CES—D, the authors conclude that the answers of the mastectomy Ss were influenced by the point at which the CES—D was administered during the interview. However, the data suggest that the better-educated Ss were less affected by the context of the interview and that the difference between the responses of the 2 groups was less on items that called for a more direct report of behavior and feelings.

AB- Reports on the initial results of a longitudinal study of 54 cancer patients and their families. The study focused on the impact of cancer on the family's reallocation of roles and on the psychosocial environment by applying a developmental model to the analysis of roles in the family throughout its life cycle. Instruments included the Washington Family Role Inventory, Marital Communication Inventory, Family Environment Scale, and interviews conducted to evaluate substages of the family life cycle. Results indicate that the spouses' communication patterns strongly influenced how well roles were enacted, the amount of role strain and role conflict, and the level of cohesion and conflict in the family. The method that the family used for reassigning roles also significantly influenced how well roles were performed and the level of cohesion in the family.

KP- psychological profile as pretreatment indicator of survival after chemotherapy
KP- males with testicular cancer
SU- Client Characteristics; Endocrine Neoplasms; Prognosis; Testes; Treatment Outcomes
AB- Prior to chemotherapy, 26 males with testicular cancer (mean age 24.9 yrs) were given a battery of psychological tests, including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Personal Orientation Inventory, and Derogatis Sexual Functioning Inventory. Results reveal that these men had a narrower range of sexual experiences than the test norms. In addition, their psychological profile was indicative of an adolescent identity crisis. The 19 long-term survivors (alive 7 yrs after testing) had a lower self-regard and more emotional symptoms, were more introverted, and tended to express more anxiety, depression, and hostility than did the 7 short-term survivors (who died within the 1st yr). Data suggest the possibility of a psychological profile of testicular cancer patients that may be used as a pretreatment indicator of probable long-term survival after chemotherapy. They also indicate that the sometimes annoying behavior of long-term survivors can be viewed as successful coping mechanisms. (17 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)
