AB- Rapid changes in health care services and delivery suggest an upcoming paradigm shift in the field of mental health. Recent national reports, health care policy changes, and growing evidence support a shift toward prevention-focused mental health care. The social work profession is uniquely positioned to act as leaders in this shift as the profession’s values, goals, and hallmark practice approach are consistent with preventive care. Most social work students, however, do not receive training in prevention practice. The author’s development, implementation, and evaluation of a prevention-focused master of social work elective in the area of mental health is presented as an example of integrating prevention content into clinical social work practice courses. Implications for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

One of the most complex and contentious sociopolitical issues of our time has been civil rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons. This teaching note considers how we, as LGBT instructors, may respond to students’ comments about LGBT-related issues when such comments are representative of ideas that challenge our personal identities.

AB- Practice incorporating policy and political social work is a key component of the social work profession and an area in which students would benefit from exposure during social work education. Field education presents a significant opportunity for students to develop policy and political practice skills; however, individual and structural barriers may prevent students from developing practice experience in this area. Based on a survey of bachelor of social work and master of social work field directors in the United States, this field note examines the current state of policy and political practice field opportunities and examines barriers to offering such opportunities more widely. Ideas to facilitate these field opportunities, including curriculum-wide education about policy practice, relationship building, creativity, and identifying diverse placement sites, are presented.

AB- Researchers surveyed licensed social workers from 5 Mid-Atlantic states to explore their perspectives on the current state of mental health and service delivery for military service workers, families, and contractors. Social workers identified needs in the following areas: mental health, physical health and wellness, social and environmental, interpersonal and family, and military-specific needs. The majority of needs were most critical during the postdeployment stage. Education related to the observed needs was reported; social workers were most interested in learning about military culture and how to coordinate resources within the community to support the total military community. Suggestions for social work education and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The purpose of this article is to report on findings from a follow-up study that examined the relationship among social work education programs, postgraduate professional development, and school social workers’ perceived levels of cultural competence in practice with urban minority youth. The initial study demonstrated that African Americans perceived a higher level of cultural competence than their Anglo American counterparts did. Findings highlight the need to understand the processes by which practitioners become culturally competent for urban school social work practice. Underscoring the importance of professional development, the authors determined that geographic location of practice may serve as a factor that influences how practitioners anticipate the need for culturally competent practice with diverse populations. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study explores the reactions of social work students in a course on trauma treatment and how those reactions changed over time. Consensual qualitative research methods were used to analyze 17 participant journals submitted at 4 times during the course. Findings indicate that students experienced a range of responses to traumatic material, including both positive and negative emotional, cognitive, behavioral, physical, and relational reactions. Student survivors of trauma reported reactions related to their own trauma. Although student reactions became less acute over time during the course, recommendations for the pedagogy of trauma are offered, including curriculum related to the management of vicarious and secondary trauma reactions as well as the development of evidence-based practices for self-care.

AB- Bachelor-level social work students (n = 198) at a midsized Midwestern public university were surveyed to evaluate their attitudes toward those with mental health concerns. Additionally, students were surveyed regarding their willingness to seek treatment for their own mental health needs. Results of the analyses suggest that the majority of students do not hold stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness. Students who believed mental health work is rewarding were less likely to be afraid or uncomfortable around people with mental illness. In addition, these students were more likely to report attitudes that acknowledge the capabilities of people with mental illness and were less concerned with others knowing their own mental health status. Implications for social work education and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Although technology can empower African Americans to adopt healthy lifestyles, the gap in usage between African Americans and Whites undermines the potential power of health Internet technology (IT) to ameliorate health disparities. This study describes the development, implementation, and outcome of a health informatics intervention by a university–community partnership to increase awareness and use of health IT resources among African Americans to address the problem of their underuse of online health resources.

AB- Professional schools are developing conceptual frameworks that can be used to assess and improve implicit curricula. Students’ professional empowerment, defined to include perceived professional competence and identity, may be considered a vital outcome of these efforts. Our study evaluated measures and tested a path model that included perceptions of characteristics of implicit curricula (i.e., faculty and staff diversity, supportive faculty, opportunity role structure, and access to information) and mediating variables (i.e., participation, sense of community, and feeling valued by the school) as predictors of professional empowerment. Respondents were students (N = 423) of a school of social work in the northeast. Results supported the validity of the scales and fit of the hypothesized model. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The perceived wisdom in the social work education community, based on empirical research from the 1990s and the early part of this century, says that the master of social work (MSW) degree is not competitive with the master of business administration or the master of public administration to obtain top-level administration jobs in nonprofit agencies. This article reviews recent information on hiring preferences of board chairs that provides new hope that the MSW degree with a concentration in management or administration is perceived as a viable and useful degree for top-level positions in human services agencies. Thus, current board chairs are more inclined to value the MSW than administrators and academics from years past. The reason is that the values of social workers are seen as quite valuable in the current environment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In 2008 the Council on Social Work Education identified field education as the signature pedagogy of social work. In doing so, it designated field education as the synthetic, integrative curricular area in which students are socialized to the profession. This article examines challenges and opportunities this designation presents. How field education can be designed and delivered as social work education’s signature pedagogy is discussed from a learning theory framework. A learning contract is described that integrates class and field in attainment of the core and advanced competencies. Use of this integrated learning contract by the field instructor and student serves to structure the field experience in a manner consistent with a signature pedagogy. The teaching role of the field instructor is recognized as a key component of the signature pedagogy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Micro social work practice can be understood in the context of its historical professional traditions and dialectics as well as the environmental pressures and demands placed on the profession. In becoming a profession, social work relied heavily on principles drawn from medicine and science. Although these bodies of knowledge provided the profession certain credibility, their application may have clouded social work’s distinctive social purpose and professional identity. In its search for a distinctive function and identity, the profession of social work has struggled with numerous dialectics, as discussed in this article. These help us to better understand the profession’s search for its distinctive identity and status and the importance of including this content in social work education.

AB- In recent years, the concept of transformation has become more prevalent in the social work literature; however, its use is quite varied. In this article, I attempt to disentangle some of these uses. I then propose a conceptualization of transformation and discuss its relevance for social work education. In this conceptualization, transformation is considered an orientation to learning and knowing rather than about particular content or an end state. I conclude with some ideas about how this conceptualization might be integrated into social work education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Graduate programs of social work have been challenged to define how the advanced generalist concentration differs from the generalist training at the baccalaureate level. This teaching note likens the generalist to a bricoleur, or skilled handyman. A role-based portrait of the advanced generalist is offered, which describes how skills of the bricoleur are transcended. Examples suggest how these definitive skills can be realized in a graduate program. The portrait is then found to be compatible with a set of advanced generalist practice behaviors and an advanced generalist exam required for licensure by several states.

It articulates the rationale and tactical approaches for aligning mission statements with the operational realities of university contexts. Within 1 school of social work, doctoral students with diverse orientations to social justice came together to articulate a vision for social justice education that expanded the educational contract between students and the institution by enhancing their respective opportunities and responsibilities in the areas of scholarship, teaching, and service. This article shares 30 learning objectives emergent from an incremental change process for enhancing social justice education at the doctoral level and reflects on the strengths and limitations of this approach to advancing social justice priorities.

AB- Although admission criteria such as GRE scores and undergraduate GPAs (UGPAs) have been shown to moderately predict success in graduate school for students in other academic disciplines and in MSW programs, no published research has examined factors associated with success in social work PhD programs. This article reports the findings of a pilot study in a Midwestern university that examined the relationship between common admissions variables and success in the doctoral program. Results indicate that GRE quantitative score, first-year doctoral GPA (DGPA), and age at admission were associated with successful completion of the doctoral program. Verbal GRE and UGPA were significantly correlated with first-year DGPA. Limitations and implications for admission and retention of students are discussed.

AB- Throughout U.S. higher education, non–tenure track faculty (NTTF) are experiencing tremendous growth. Traditionally part-time instructors, increasing numbers of NTTF are full-time faculty but have lower salaries, fewer benefits, and less integration into their schools than tenure-track peers. Although this general trend is reflected in schools of social work, information regarding this phenomenon specific to schools of social work is scarce. This article examines reasons driving the trend by comparing national patterns with 1 school of social work’s current project that aims to develop guidelines regarding job promotion for a diverse cohort of NTTF. We highlight factors contributing to the creation of NTTF promotion materials, and we discuss the strengths, challenges, and costs of this process.

Findings indicate great diversity in all 3 categories. Bachelor’s degrees of social work are offered in 83.3% of the programs, and 38.8% of the programs offer master’s degrees. Department affiliation varies, with only 42.7% having an independent department or school of social work. Most social work programs were started after 2000. This review indicates a rapid growth in social work education in mainland China. However, the lack of advanced degrees and standardized affiliations may hide the effect and the image of the programs.

This study assessed a required writing course with a sample of 49 baccalaureate students. From online pre- and posttest surveys, 2 student outcomes improved significantly: self-reported scores for writing self-efficacy and competence in course objectives. On-demand writing samples improved significantly based on anonymous ratings by the course instructors; however, blind ratings found gains but not at a significant level. Improved outcomes were not associated with demographic or background characteristics. We discuss limitations of the study and implications for social work education.

AB- Experiential learning is recommended as a way to increase critical thinking and engagement, enhance theory-informed practice, increase preparedness, and improve multicultural understanding for students involved in social work education. The purpose of this study is to validate the Experiential Learning Survey (ELS), which measures students’ perceptions of experience-based educational instruction. Five hundred and fifty-three students enrolled in human service courses completed a multidimensional survey. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the use of 4 subscales. Each subscale and the global scale had good reliability, and the overall model fit was acceptable. Evidence of convergent and discriminant construct validity was established. Results from this validation study reveal that the ELS is a valid and reliable tool for assessing various characteristics of hands-on learning.

AB- In this article, we report the findings from a study exploring the effects of a problem-based learning (PBL) approach to teaching and learning on learning outcomes for master’s of social work (MSW) students. Students who participated in a PBL pilot project were compared with students who did not participate in 5 outcome areas: social work knowledge, values, and skills; confidence in practice skills; confidence in learning skills; motivation to engage in deep learning and use deep-learning strategies; and satisfaction with their MSW education. PBL and non-PBL approaches were equally effective in helping students learn social work skills, knowledge, and values and in developing learning skills; the non-PBL group reported a significant shift to a more situational approach to their learning.

AB- There is a decades-old debate in social work regarding the appropriateness of the use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) by clinicians in this profession. Despite often contentious perspectives, there has been very little study regarding clinical social workers’ experiences, attitudes, and beliefs about the use of the DSM in their work. In this qualitative inquiry, 20 clinical social workers who had recently completed master’s of social work coursework and were working with children were interviewed using grounded theory methods. Results of the inquiry are presented and implications for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article describes the development of self-care practices of social work students who were part of a larger study of students’ experiences in a graduate course on the treatment of trauma. Consensual qualitative research methods were used to analyze 17 participant journals submitted at 4 times during the course. Findings indicated that students benefited from being introduced to evidence-based practices for mediating the stress of trauma education, including journaling and mindfulness-based stress reduction. Although students reported struggling with developing effective self-care practices, they demonstrated an ability to integrate self-care into their professional practice behaviors. The authors review recommendations for research and pedagogy of self-care practices in courses on trauma treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Incorporating material on professional self-care into social work course content is valuable to the education of neophyte social work practitioners. This article presents a review of the literature on professional burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion fatigue, including the risk factors associated with the experience of these conditions. The literature suggests that students are particularly vulnerable to these conditions as they enter their field placements due to their lack of professional practice experience. To address this educational need among social work students, this article provides suggestions for incorporating material on professional self-care into both micro and macro course offerings and includes a sample case study that links self-care to the current Council on Social Work Education social work competencies and practice behaviors.

AB- This article explores competencies and methods for their assessment in higher education and in social work’s accreditation standards. Many contemporary policy and educational accreditation efforts employ the model of competency assessment. The current emphasis on accountability in higher education, including the Council on Social Work Education’s 2008 and draft 2015 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards, is contextualized through a short history of this movement and its purposes. A multipart definition of competencies is offered based on McClelland’s pivotal conceptualization of competency assessment. Within this competency model, several methods of assessing competencies in social work education are described and critically examined. The importance of identifying an appropriate and complete list of competencies is also addressed. Several issues regarding how to assess professional competencies are identified for future professional discussion. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study used qualitative in-depth interviews and focus groups to examine the role of spirituality at end of life (EOL) in Nova Scotia’s Black community. We also examined data from another research project that examined health issues in the Black community. The purpose of this research was to examine the issue of spirituality from the perspective of family caregivers, and spiritual leaders who have cared for someone who has died. More specifically, we explored how spirituality is expressed and how it serves as a coping mechanism during times of suffering and hardship at the EOL. Principal findings include the need for health providers to be aware of the spiritual needs of families of African descent and to include spirituality as a part of the EOL care plan.

AB- The profession of social work has deep roots in organized religion. While courses on spirituality have recently been on the curriculum in some schools of social work, religion is not incorporated into social work programs. In spite of a decline in church attendance in Canada, religion continues to be a salient force in the lives of many people particularly when they are nearing the end of life. Social workers working in palliative care need to be knowledgeable of religion and have sensitivity to religious practices. This requires a familiarity with religious language and skills in supporting people who look to religion for answers to the meaning and purpose in their lives and their deaths. It is frequently in times of crisis and uncertainty that people’s faith becomes central. Social workers need the skills to support them on the end of life journey.

AB- Spirituality’s relevance to the field of social work has grown through its expansion in literature, research, and practice over the past two decades. While studies in spirituality of diverse human groups abound in social work literature and research, there is a dearth of reported investigations on spirituality in the Deaf community. In this article, results of a mixed method research study that explored the spiritual director’s spiritual and technological experiences, coupled with an examination of the spiritual directees’ experiences, are presented and discussed. Based on findings from thematic analyses of the study, language, and culture were two relational features of spirituality that was congruent with the literature review in Deaf studies. Implications for the social work profession with its holistic approach and emphasis on cultural competency with clients are discussed. While the spiritual and technological experiences of the spiritual director and spiritual directees provided insight that may impact professional practices in the helping professions in the field of deafness, it is suggested that research in social work continue to study spirituality in the Deaf community in order to better understand their spiritual needs and develop culturally appropriate and spiritually sensitive practices.

AB- This article proposes the Reinsmith-Jones model as a spiritually based treatment model for treating people diagnosed with Body Dysmorphia Disorder (BDD). The model is based on research conducted with transsexual people while in transition from one gender to the opposite. It is proposed that understanding, knowledge, and practice wisdom, gained in the study of the spiritual journeys of transitioning transsexual people, might be effective and applicable to people with BDD. This article concludes that clinicians working with those diagnosed with BDD should pay close attention to the spiritual component of clients and the nexus of self-image and spirituality during the treatment process.

AB- This article gives insights about the various ways that people with severe mental illnesses experience spiritual benefits and struggles in the context of their life journeys, and how these are navigated through time as part of a spiritual development process. Multiple in-depth interviews were conducted with 18 individuals with a range of diagnoses and spiritual affiliations receiving services at community mental health centers and consumer-run organizations in a Midwestern state. The study identified four patterns in the way people with severe mental illnesses utilized spirituality as part of their lives and recovery through time, which were named “basic impact” on recovery; “symptoms as a barrier” to using spirituality in recovery; learning to use spirituality for recovery “in progress”; and “high synergy” between spirituality and recovery. Implications for social workers and related mental health practitioners are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Spiritually focused interventions are increasing within social work/helping professions practice and research. Specifically the incorporation of meditation is taking root. This article conceptualizes a particular mantra meditation system, combined with visualization, called Mahavakyam Meditation (MM), and explores how it ameliorated the stress, sadness, and anxiety for women attending university. MM differs from the application of other mantra meditations in western therapeutic approaches with its unique emphasis on the creative potential of thought. MM includes two components: repetition of four proclamations, and creating a positive mental image of a goal not yet accomplished but imagined and believed as if it were already achieved. In this qualitative arts-based exploratory study, the author adopted a collage method as a form of analysis and representation to understand university women’s experiences of applying meditation and visualization as an alternative mental health strategy. Findings indicated that participants realized a reduction of their distressing symptoms in a number of ways: a broadened perspective, the ability to reject adverse self-talk, increased awareness and feelings of tranquility, joy, and self-acceptance, an increased belief in the capacity to achieve goals, and enhanced contemplation on and motivation to fulfill those goals. The collage method was well suited to the experiential MM. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Anxiety and depression are complex mental health concerns affecting adolescents, and when experienced together the prognosis can be worsened. Current evidence based approaches used in social work interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical therapy, and counselling incorporating psychotherapy and psychoeducation, however they do not work for all individuals and they are not holistic. This paper argues that spirituality is a missing element of current social work interventions for treating anxiety and depression. Yoga has emerged as one type of mind body spirit intervention that is more holistic in nature, and it is deemed to be a positive approach that can be included in social work interventions. Furthermore, the explicit incorporation of spirituality is seen as a necessary component of treatment. Literature pertaining to spirituality as an important dimension of life, mental health, coping and wellbeing provides a rationale for its inclusion into comprehensive multi-modal approaches. The HEALTHY group is highlighted as a comprehensive multi-modal mind body spirit approach that addresses the gap of explicitly attending to spirituality. Implications for practice are put forth regarding the need for research on this kind of comprehensive integrative mind body and spirit social work intervention on the outcomes for adolescents experiencing anxiety and depression.

AB- A traumatic event can occur at any point in an adolescent’s life. Yet, research suggests that the negative impact of a traumatic event on adolescent’s well-being can be minimized with timely and effective intervention. Careful review of the trauma literature identifies the significance of both community and faith-based intervention in positive post-traumatic recovery. A link has been identified between the use of Christian strategies and a decreased risk of post-traumatic symptoms. However, the literature examined suggests that adolescents may avoid the use of Christian strategies during their recovery because of the effects that their developmental milestones have on their perception of the Christian faith. Based on this research, spiritual based strategies are discussed in an effort to effectively respond to the spiritual and psychological needs of adolescents in faith-based schools in the occasion of a traumatic event. This article outlines literature promoting the significance of Christian-based trauma intervention strategies for adolescents and how social workers can assist school personnel to apply these strategies in the event of a trauma.

This position is predicated on the idea that integrating the perspectives of different disciplines is necessary for developing meaningful answers to complicated social problems. The purpose of this brief teaching note is to describe the development of a new interdisciplinary PhD program at Tulane University. The program is called City, Community & Culture, and it confers degrees in social work, sociology, and urban studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- An increase in Latinos in the social work academy is critical due to current underrepresentation in social work education programs and rapid Latino population growth in the United States. In this qualitative study, perceptions of Mexican American master’s of social work–level practitioners regarding social work doctoral education and academia were explored. Findings indicate a deep commitment to making a contribution to the profession and Latino communities through direct practice, teaching, and field instruction. In addition to structural barriers to pursuing doctoral education, there was skepticism of the relevance of a PhD to serving the profession or Latino communities. Findings are discussed with regard to their implications for recruitment, socialization, and retention of Latino social work students for academic careers.

AB- The prevalence of suicide suggests social workers will encounter clients at risk for suicide, but research shows social workers receive little to no training on suicide and suicide prevention and feel unprepared to work effectively with clients at risk. Baseline results from a randomized intervention study of the Question, Persuade, and Refer suicide prevention gatekeeper training with 73 advanced master’s of social work student interns show suicide knowledge was average, attitudes about suicide prevention were generally neutral, and use of suicide prevention practice skills was low. These results indicate an opportunity for enhancing student outcomes through training and inform social work education regarding necessary preparation for student interns and new graduates to identify and respond effectively to client suicide risk.

AB- An anonymous Web-based survey was used to gather the perceptions and experiences from 114 faculty members teaching in 16 social work programs in the California State University system about the effect of severe budget cuts on their educational activities. Most respondents reported they worked on their furlough days and maintained the same or larger workload that they had before the furlough. Larger workloads, diminished feelings of personal accomplishment, and stressful interactions with students were associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion. Implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social work is emerging as a rapidly developing profession in mainland China, a unique context that affects how these new social workers view themselves, their professional identity, and their work. Few studies explore the lived experiences of these new social workers as they enter agencies and begin working with clients while interacting with larger systems that influence clients and social workers alike. This case study highlights the experience of one of the first professionally educated social workers in Shanghai and describes the challenges and achievements of her first 5 years of professional practice. This case highlights the professional experiences and feelings of many social workers in China. We give recommendations for social work education and training.

AB- Every week there is a national news story involving a collegiate student-athlete, and oftentimes the tale relates to a social work education issue. There are 731 social work programs, yet none offers coursework in student-athlete behavior and their environment. Student-athletes experience the same developmental challenges as nonathletes, and mental health disorders, substance abuse challenges, and criminal justice involvement can be exacerbated by their dual roles. This article describes the structure of collegiate sports and athletic department counseling and case management strategies; explores social work education content areas, educational policy and accreditation standards, and related student-athlete vulnerabilities; and it presents avenues to explore student-athlete developmental issues within social work curricula. The article concludes with the benefits of integrating collegiate athletics into social work education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Interdisciplinary programs in schools of social work are growing in scope and number. This article reports on collaboration between a school of social work and a school of engineering, which is forging a new area of interdisciplinary education. The program engages social work students working alongside engineering students in a team approach to developing and implementing international community development projects. The author chronicles the prevalence and types of interdisciplinary, academic social work collaborations over the past 2 decades and outlines the uniqueness of an engineering and social work partnership. After presenting the components of the collaboration, the author analyzes the collaboration’s fit for social work education using a model of interdisciplinary social work. Implications for social work education and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Results indicate statistically significant increases in 5 of the 8 journals and in the mean number of authors across the 8 journals when combined. Although sole authorship was the norm in 2001, by 2011 the majority of articles were co-authored. Possible explanations for the observed changes in the rates of collaboration and some consequences for social work scholarship are reviewed. Implications for social work education and scholarship are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article examines an ongoing university–community relationship that fuses innovative technology delivery, university-outreach research, and social work practice/research education into a unique, collaborative intervention to reduce homelessness. In doing so, we apply a social justice framework to homelessness, arguing that housing is a right rather than a privilege. In the case study, a university, in partnership with a local homeless coalition, maintains a management information system to collect and analyze real-time data on homelessness in the community. The overarching social justice intention of this partnership is to improve client outcomes for homeless individuals by producing community-based research to inform policy decisions for governmental and organizational partners.

AB- Strengths-based practice (SBP) is one of the primary modalities of social work practice. The literature on SBP does not address a standardized tool for measuring SBP or whether receipt of a social work degree is related to practice orientation. We measure SBP with a provider-based Strengths-Based Practices Inventory (SBPI-P) and examine whether a social work degree is associated with a higher level of SBP among 453 child welfare workers. The results indicate that the SBPI-P is a reliable measure of SBP, with three factors—Empowerment, Community–Culture, and Sensitivity–Knowledge—and that receipt of a social work degree is not associated with SBP. We discuss the potential reasons for the results and make recommendations for future research in the measurement of SBP.

AB- Urban legends circulate throughout society, including higher education and social work education. Some academic mythologies take on the status of a tradition—no matter the evidence or lack thereof—and continue to thrive, to influence thinking, and to shape norms, which, in turn, direct behaviors. As with urban legends, academic myths are able to overpower and dismiss the conclusions drawn from critical thinking processes. Accreditation standards, common program structures, and faculty behaviors and expectations have evolved over time grounded in and shaped by various legends. Social work educators applying critical thinking processes to their educational enterprise will be able to challenge with intellectual rigor the profession’s urban legends, which will then result in national standards and program models that are creative, proactive, and forward-thinking.

AB- This exploratory study examined the effects of religious identification and gender on psychosocial adaptation among a nonrandom sample of 440 Japanese immigrants who lived in Texas. The study revealed that a religious effect became salient in terms of the cross-cultural adaptation and life outcomes of first-generation immigrants. Christian immigrants were significantly better adjusted than were their Buddhist or atheist counterparts. Although there was little or no gender effect, female immigrants enjoyed higher emotional well-being than did their male counterparts. The findings have implications for social work in terms of client religion and, possibly, gender as well as services to enhance psychosocial adaptation of first-generation immigrants in the United States.

AB- Social work ethics and values are the cornerstone of the profession and guide social work practice, education, and policy. Little research has examined the experience of conflict between personal values and professional ethics, or the beliefs of social workers about the prioritization of values within practice. This study explores whether social workers experience conflict between religious values and professional ethics and beliefs about the prioritization of religious values and professional roles. Overall participants reported little experience of value conflict and agreed that professional values supersede religious ones. The interaction of religiosity, political beliefs, primary work function, and sex are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Faith groups are among the few organizations that serve individuals and families across the life span. When social workers and faith leaders in small towns and rural communities build mutual understanding and trust, the resulting professional interdisciplinary relationships can lead to collaborative service provision that benefits families. This review of the literature includes current research that provides a lens through which social workers can understand faith leaders and faith groups, gain a perspective on the importance of their role within rural communities, and obtain practical guidance in best practices for collaborative social services to individuals and families.

AB- The significance of spirituality to the well-being and success of women of Color academics is discussed in this article. Participating women of Color revealed the complexities of navigating teaching, scholarship, and service responsibilities as well as the tenure and promotion process. Spirituality was identified as one of the most important sustaining and protective factors in the success of these women of Color. Spirituality was conceptualized broadly by these women as an inclusive and multidimensional phenomenon. Also suggested are implications for future research, academic and policy changes that would support the specific journeys of women of Color in the academy.

AB- Respondents responded to vignettes about the mental competence of an older woman, an older man, a younger woman, or a younger man who was identified as wealthy and who had decided to give her/his wealth to a religious organization with which the person had been associated for a year. Controlling for respondents’ educational programs, exposure to psychopathology and aging curriculum, and religious affiliation, a General Linear Model revealed that although respondents did not believe the vignette characters were significantly impaired, there were differences in perceptions based on the gender and age of the character they considered in nine of 20 items. The older woman and older men were more likely to be viewed to be in need of a capacity assessment than the younger woman or man. An additional four items were considered to avoid a Type II error because of their proximity to significance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article describes 1 large urban pediatric hospital's partnership with a university to provide suicide assessment and management training within its social work department. Social work administrators conducted a department-wide needs assessment and implemented a 2-session suicide assessment training program and evaluation. Respondents (97.8%) indicated that the training was either helpful or very helpful in 8 suicide assessment skill-based domains. All attendees reported positive changes in perceived competence in 6 of 8 skill-based domains. A brief and time-efficient in-service training can be instrumental in augmenting hospital social worker competence in suicide risk assessment practice. This model of training program development, implementation, and evaluation is feasible, evidence-informed, and may be replicated.

AB- In an effort to reform public child welfare systems across the nation, Title IV-E child welfare training programs were established over 2 decades ago. Participating students typically engage in a customized educational experience as part of their MSW program that prepares them to work in the field of child welfare upon graduation. This article describes an initiative taking place in one MSW program where students are encouraged to serve as a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA), paired with an individual child or youth in foster care. The purpose is to offer students a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of children in care. Information relating to program design and student perspectives on the experience are presented.

AB- The study reported in this article concerns the beginnings of higher education for women in the Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) enclave in Israel. Haredi Jews are a self-secluded fundamentalist group committed to particularly strict interpretation of Jewish religious law. In recent years, they have been compelled by poverty and other factors to allow academic education, hitherto considered out of bounds, especially for women. Focus groups with 32 Haredi women enrolled in the social work program at the Haredi College in Jerusalem reveal the obstacles the women encountered both from conservative forces in the community and from within themselves as well as the means that they used to cope with them.

The reported age range in Table 2 should have been 26–81. In addition to this, the abstract was incorrect. The correct version appears with the erratum.] This study reports results from a national Internet-based survey administered anonymously to a cross-section of social work faculty in the United States. Drawn from a sampling frame of 700 accredited or in candidacy schools, data were collected between November 2010 and March 2011. We investigate the role of sex, sexual orientation, race, religious affiliation and beliefs, religiosity, political ideology, sexism, and interest in sexuality/LGBTQ issues. Race, religiosity, political ideology, and sexism are associated with sexual prejudice, which was endorsed among a small percentage (14%) of the sample (n = 303). Outcome scores were not statistically different based on the targets’ sex. Strategies are recommended to reduce sexual prejudice among social work faculty and to increase institutional support for acceptance in the academy.

AB- There is a growing imperative to prepare MSW social work students for trauma-informed evidence-based practice. Given strong recommendations and promising developments within social work education and practice in this regard, a clinical elective for the advanced-year MSW student that combines the guiding principles of trauma theory and problem-based learning was created. This article describes the course objectives, structure, and format and reports on an evaluation based on 7 (total) offerings of the course by 4 different schools of social work. The course methodology was found to be effective in all schools in significantly increasing students’ self-confidence in working with traumatized children, adolescents, and their families. Implications for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Although foundational practice classes play a key role in helping prepracticum students develop counseling skills, we know little about the effectiveness of this form of helping skills training. This study assessed the effect of helping skills training delivered in foundational practice classes on proximal indicators of counseling skills acquisition, including measures of counseling self-efficacy, empathy, anxiety, and hindering self-awareness or rumination. Participating students made significant gains in counseling self-efficacy that were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Reductions in anxiety, rumination, and personal distress in interpersonally challenging situations were observed at follow-up, indicating that students made a successful transition to the field following training. The frequency of large-group role plays in particular was related to gains in students’ counseling self-efficacy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social work field instructors are responsible for the gatekeeping function of evaluating student performance and determining practice readiness. Yet little empirical literature elucidates how field instructors of graduating BSW students judge competence, suitability, or readiness for practice. This qualitative study reports findings from 6 focus groups attended by 28 experienced BSW field instructors aimed at (a) exploring criteria used to judge student readiness for entry-level practice and (b) examining differences in expectations based on micro and macro placements. Two capacities emerged as being paramount in supporting the development of practice skills, personal attributes, and areas of practice in both micro and macro placements: conceptualization and self-reflection. Implications for evaluating student competence and supporting student learning in the field are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In social work field education, mentoring is underused and lacks research data. There is a paucity of research that examines the effect mentoring has on social work field directors who administer field programs at the undergraduate and/or graduate level. This exploratory study fills this void by examining the mentoring opportunities and experiences of field directors. The results show that there is a desire by field directors to receive assistance and collaborate with mentors on scholarly activities. The most helpful aspects of mentoring include having a mentor who acted as a sounding board, gave advice on administering the field program, and provided strategies for success. Suggestions for future research on mentoring field directors are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article presents a conceptual model of the field director's role outside of field education, specifically in the following 3 areas of leadership: (1) curricular, (2) programmatic, and (3) institutional. A survey was conducted to explore the field director's input targeted in these areas beyond prescribed field education tasks. The results showed that 3 structural variables (field director as faculty member, field director in tenure-track position, field director as member of a program's administrative team) were significant in influencing the amount of input by field directors and in contributing to their self-perceptions of feeling valued.

AB- Sixteen MSW distance programs provided insight into how the implicit curriculum currently exists within their programs. Overall, distance programs carried out the activities necessary for student development; the student population made for a more diverse learning community; and faculty were receiving training. There was still a heavy reliance on making contact with students using nonvirtual space. In fact, distance programs might not be taking full advantage of how technology can support virtual contact. There also seemed to be an absence of findings that distance programs are using technology to bring the explicit content in through various media. Throughout the discussion, suggestions are provided for using technology to facilitate the manifestation of the implicit curriculum throughout the distance program.

The study was an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design including a national survey of 121 deans/directors, followed by group interviews of 15 deans. Findings are that Web-based technology for delivering social work courses is increasing and predicted to grow. Interviews documented the difficulties of transforming organizational environments. Recommendations for social work leadership include convening curriculum leaders in schools of social work to work together to further technology innovations and cross institutional research.

AB- Social work education is engaged in a significant evolutionary phase of its development, spearheaded by the Council on Social Work Education and the 2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS). This article suggests that an organizational change–anchored focus is a little discussed but ultimately important set of theories and frameworks that have potential to greatly affect successful EPAS implementation. Attention to the organizational change literature with specific focus on theories and models of organizational readiness for change, organizational resistance to change, and, finally, implementation science might enhance the effectiveness and, ultimately, the effect of the positive opportunities associated with the new EPAS while simultaneously protecting and preserving the most important knowledge, ethics, values, and traditions of social work education.

AB- Bangladesh is a country with a population of over 150 million where the majority of its people, 88.3%, are Muslim. Christians form a very small minority of only 0.3% of the population. However, because Christians in Bangladesh take their cultural identity very seriously, they play a significant role in education and social development of the country. This article looks at how most of the Psalms in the Holy Bible are focused mainly on justice issues and therefore have a great potential in inspiring and motivating people to engage in relevant social work and thereby grow in the spirituality of solidarity. The article then discusses the recently published Bengali song book “Amar Praner Psalmgeet” the lyrics of which are based on the Psalms, and explores its potential for the Christian communities to engage further in social development and cultivate the spirituality of solidarity.

AB- Singapore is a multicultural society with a population of about 5.1 million comprising mainly of people with Chinese, Malay, and Indian descent. This article focuses on a review of literature on the interface of religion and ethnic worldviews of the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore. In addition, it will utilize practice examples to show how these worldviews have implications for social work practice with the Malay-Muslim community particularly in the areas of health and family well-being. Help-seeking and the provision of help must acknowledge and use these worldviews as “strengths” in the delivery of social services. The article ends with an emphasis on the need for training in cultural competence for social workers in multicultural societies such as Singapore.

AB- This study suggests that Buddhist priests’ sutra chanting can heal troubled and bereaved people. Sutra chanting can include home visits with teatime chats, and memorial services to console the spirits of the departed. Japanese “Funeral Buddhism” has been criticized for its lack of social engagement, but home visits and memorial services may partly counter such criticisms. This study presents four cases collected through chain sampling of Zen monks using semistructured interviews in December 2012. Respondents were asked to reflect on helping laypeople along with their usual activities. Their temples are in suburban areas of cities affected by the 3.11 earthquake-tsunami disaster.

AB- Chinese people display different usage patterns of mental health service, while mental health social workers report encountering cultural difficulties in delivering traditional Western psychosocial interventions. Culture and behavior of Chinese people are heavily influenced by Daoist philosophy and practices. This article discusses the application of Daoist concepts in working with people with mental illness, and reports the development of a pilot empowerment program for Chinese people with depressive symptoms. In an uncontrolled study, participants (N = 61) after the program reported significantly lower levels of depression and anxiety. They also reported reduced affliction and increased equanimity, two concepts pertinent in the Chinese conception of mental well-being. The findings suggest culturally sensitive integrative social work interventions can complement the existing mental health care system in Chinese communities.

AB- With nearly 80% of Vietnamese people holding Buddhist beliefs in some form, Buddhism-based healing is popular in Vietnam. Coupled with cultural stigma against seeking formal mental health services, Vietnamese people with psychological needs frequently seek different forms of healing at Buddhist temples, including exorcism and spirit-calling. In this article, I present case vignettes of exorcism and spirit-calling that I documented during my ethnographic study in Vietnam. Based on these cases, I will discuss the healing impact of spiritual activities like Buddhism-based exorcism and spirit-calling for Vietnamese people and implications for social work in Vietnam and elsewhere.

AB- Compassion practices originating from the Buddhist meditation traditions have aroused considerable interest among many Western practitioners and researchers over the past decade. In this article the author explores the potential of compassion practice for clinical interventions by examining psychological conflict experienced among East Asian populations in Confucian societies. This is followed by a discussion of the historical roots of Buddhist compassion practice and a rationale for its application for people with depression or anxiety. The implications of clinical applications, suggested procedures, and possible difficulties are highlighted. Compassion-Mindfulness Therapy (C-MT) has been developed and the positive results of a randomized control trial are offered, suggesting support for the benefits of mindfulness and compassion practices for individuals suffering from depression and anxiety.

This Special Edition has started a journey towards illuminating minority spirituality and to understanding other ways of healing, knowing, and transforming individuals, families, and communities. This Indigenous knowledge is vital to understanding humanity and to enabling Indigenous communities to sustain their ways of being and healing in the future. Social work must recognize and honor this knowledge as part of a different yet holistic way of thinking and intervening. In order to protect indigenous knowledge and ways of healing, the profession will have to move beyond Eurocentric knowledge which has eroded minority spiritualities, and respectfully engage and interact with indigenous communities as an intrinsic part of social work.

AB- Legislative advocacy is an important and long-standing skill in social work. However, this role cannot be left solely to social workers who specialize in macro and policy practice. Rather, clinical social workers who assist clients as they face "private" troubles (Mills, 1959) also need to face the structural barriers that contribute to these concerns. The effect of proposed bills on the practice and welfare of clients is another reason for clinical social workers to advocate within the legislative process. This article proposes the Advocacy Week model, which prepares clinical students for the National Association of Social Workers-sponsored Advocacy Day, an event that represents a statewide collaboration of policy and clinical faculty members and National Association of Social Workers-Illinois staff members.

This article provides a systematic review of the literature that focused on social workers' and social work students' attitudes toward older adults and working with older adults. The authors sought empirical studies that used an attitudinal measure of ageism with a social work sample, and a total of 20 articles met the criteria. Characteristics of the studies' participants, methodology, instruments, and results were evaluated. This article discusses the findings and offers implications for future research.

AB- Empathy is a familiar term in social work education, although how to teach and learn empathy is not well documented. Equally, how non-indigenous Australian practitioners learn empathic regard for indigenous peoples living with the crippling legacies of colonialism is not commonly described in the literature. The primary aim of the classroom-based inquiry described here was to explore and reflect on the concept of empathy with social work students at a regional Australian university using selected real-life vignettes. These findings suggest greater cultivation of empathy is needed for respectful social work intervention by non-indigenous practitioners working with Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and, by implication, with indigenous peoples worldwide.

AB- This study explored the attitudes of MSW students (N = 147) toward transracial adoption and included an investigation of the students' personal experiences that may affect their attitudes. Statistical analyses revealed that although the majority of students supported the practice of transracial adoption, a number of students gave neutral responses to several items related to transracially adopted children's ethnic identity, likely indicating a lack of awareness of the consequences of transracial adoption. White students were more likely than students of other racial groups to support the practice of transracial adoption. Personal experiences, such as dating interracially and supporting interracial dating, appeared to affect students' attitudes toward transracial adoption. Limitations and implications for social work education and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The study of ways that professional power is perceived in social work practice is limited. This exploratory qualitative study analyzes second-year MSW students' perceptions of professional power in social work practice. This inquiry is guided by social constructivism and symbolic interactionism perspectives. The authors used constant comparison methods to analyze documents (student papers on professional power). Two emergent themes, operationalizing power and conceptualizing professional power, are presented. The importance of understanding and taking responsibility for power dynamics endemic to social work relationships is discussed.

AB- This study examined the extent to which criminal justice content is addressed in all CSWE-accredited MSW programs in the United States (N = 192). Criminal justice content was measured in three areas: (1) dual or joint degree programs, (2) concentrations or specializations, and (3) coursework. Excluding social work and law classes, 22% of all MSW programs offered a course specific to criminal justice. Nine programs (5%) offered a concentration or specialization in criminal justice. Only 1% of MSW programs offered all three areas of criminal justice content. These findings indicate that opportunities for MSW students to explore interests in criminal justice are quite limited. Implications for the influence of the social work profession on criminal justice policy and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article presents results from an evaluation of an online statistics lab as part of a foundations research methods course for master's-level social work students. The article discusses factors that contribute to an environment in social work that fosters attitudes of reluctance toward learning and teaching statistics in research methods courses. Students' evaluations (N = 25) suggest that implementing online statistics labs as a part of a foundations research methods course may help students form more positive attitudes toward statistics and improve their ability to read scholarly articles. Description of the course is provided, and challenges to implementation are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Reliable and valid methods to evaluate student competence are needed in social work education, and practice examinations with standardized clients may hold promise for social work. The authors conducted a critical appraisal of standardized client simulations used in social work education to assess their effectiveness for teaching and for evaluating social work students' competence. Following a comprehensive search, 18 studies, including 515 social work students, were examined. The authors extracted data from these studies and study methods and assessed the results. This review found that studies vary in methodological quality; however, using standardized client simulations is well-received by students. Consistent implementation methods and reliable, valid assessment measures are needed to advance this evaluation method for social work.

AB- Given the United States' population changes and the increasing impact of globalization, international context and experience in the MSW curriculum are essential. Gaining popularity as a vehicle for such experience are short-term international courses, defined as educational trips outside the United States lasting from 1 to 3 weeks. To achieve desired outcomes, courses must include both strong course curriculum and pedagogical approaches that support learning from experience and critical reflection. In this article, we describe our short-term international MSW school-supported course methodology. We use three critical incidents to illustrate tensions and challenges inherent in MSW study abroad programs. Finally, we offer three pedagogical approaches to deepen and enhance learning in short-term international courses: experiential learning, transformative learning, and decolonizing pedagogy.

AB- This study organized a participatory action research team to investigate Council on Social Work Education policies and their effect on the teaching and production of evaluation at the master's level. Data were collected in the form of 282 theses, 27 surveys, and 7 telephone interviews with field instructors to examine the use of evidence-based practice with students in field instruction. The study results indicate that students produced fewer theses and practice-based research papers compared to conceptual papers. Although field instructors valued evaluation in social work practice, the majority of respondents did not feel adequately prepared to engage students in its use in field instruction. The study suggests ways in which schools of social work can bridge the gaps between research and practice through evaluation.

AB- The foundation year and specialization year of study are the accepted framework for graduate social work education. A common belief among educators is that accreditation standards are prescriptive by design, resulting in a rigidity that neither encourages nor supports curricular innovation. This article outlines a newly developed curriculum model that focuses on preparation for advanced practice. By using the 2008 EPAS stated intention to develop new and "emerging models of curriculum design," the author describes a graduate model in which three of the four academic semesters of study are devoted to advanced study, whereas foundation study is limited to a one-semester, cohort student modular learning experience.

AB- Social work educators are uniquely tasked with balancing content while helping students evaluate personal biases and develop ethical conduct necessary for social work professionalism. Social work education may benefit from technology like Student Response Systems (SRS) that allow educators to pose questions on sensitive topics in real time while simultaneously eliciting students' anonymous responses and leading discussion. This article reviews literature on SRS, also known as “clickers,” and presents findings from a survey regarding the use of SRS in a BSW-level social policy class. A model is presented to guide educators in their decisions to incorporate SRS into the classroom, and implications for social work education are discussed.

AB- The literature on team-based learning (TBL) as a pedagogical methodology in social work education is limited; however, TBL, which was developed as a model for business, has been successfully used as a teaching methodology in nursing, business, engineering, medical school, and many other disciplines in academia. This project examines the use of TBL in a Human Behavior in the Social Environment (HBSE) class and how a convenience sample (n = 44) of undergraduate students responds to this method of learning. The project addresses the implications for this pedagogical style as an innovative way for teaching the social work curriculum and preparing a future generation of social workers to be productive members of work-related and professional groups.

AB- This study examined the treatment of epistemology and methodological rigor in qualitative social work dissertations. Template-based review was conducted on a random sample of 75 dissertations completed between 2008 and 2010. For each dissertation, we noted the presence or absence of four markers of epistemology: theory, paradigm, reflexivity, and power. We also examined methods choices and the strategies used for ensuring rigor. Results suggested that most (96%) doctoral students completing qualitative dissertations address theory, but fewer refer to reflexivity (45%), paradigm (13%), or power dynamics (8%). Students typically used multiple strategies for ensuring rigor. Grounded theory and phenomenology were the most popular methods choices, followed by case studies, ethnography, or narrative methods. Implications for doctoral education are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In uncertain economic times, universities have taken steps to address financial problems by including the use of business models. In 2009, the California State University (CSU) system implemented furloughs of a 10% pay reduction and 18 days removed from the academic calendar. Faculty in 16 CSU schools of social work participated in a Web-based survey (N = 118) regarding the effect of the furlough along with their intent to leave the CSU system. Results found that minority faculty reported higher financial strain. The regression of significant variables on intent to leave found that feelings acknowledgment and financial strain predicted 36% of the variance. Loss of CSU social work faculty is likely to affect the quality of education. Implications for retention are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The global nature of social problems indicates how important it is for social workers to be involved in international issues. For example, overseas experience in social work programs is in consonance with the Council on Social Work Education's emphasis on global context of social work practice. In view of this, some schools of social work are facilitating international experience for their students and faculty. This article discusses the experiences of U.S. students who studied abroad in Ghana in summer 2010, under the University Studies Abroad Consortium (USAC). It specifically examines the impact the USAC Ghana program, the people and culture of the host country, intracountry trips/tours, and the social work courses had on the student participants.

Using data from an online survey of social workers and other human service professionals (N = 56) who completed or expressed interest in a financial social work certification program, we found that respondents were able to apply what they learned to help their clients and valued the practical and interactive nature of program content. We also found that respondents were not immune from experiencing some of the same financial problems that confront their clients. Implications for educating BSW and MSW students about household finance are presented and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Reflection on case material is traditionally believed to promote better clinical practice; recent neurobiological understandings explain why reflection consolidates learning and allows professional heuristics to develop. Here, we describe a practice in context (PIC) framework that requires reflection on the contextual and decisional aspects of a case and further reflection on potential changes for use in similar cases in the future. We analyze cases using the PIC framework to identify themes related to the use of self to identify potential best practices. The framework is shown to function to promote reflection at all levels of practice; published cases provide “role-modeling” for students, while also creating data for analysis of best practices.

Students enrolled in a social work doctoral program conducted a single case study that took a retrospective look at the student experience in a two-semester research practicum at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. A description of the research practicum course was drawn from key contact interviews and course materials. A review of archived records located 17 practicum publications and presentations. Cohort members' reflections on the research practicum course were analyzed using thematic content analysis. The case study informs the future design of doctoral research practicum courses and the socialization of social work educators and researchers.

Students in field practica participate in activities that involve observation, doing (participatory), and conceptual linkage. In this study of MSW students, conceptual linkage activities represent students' overall reflective capacity to integrate classroom theory and field practice. The results indicate that conceptual linkage activities are more strongly related to learning outcomes than observation or participatory activities. There is also a significant interaction effect between participatory activities and conceptual linkage activities when students' satisfaction is considered. Discussion includes suggestions for increasing students' reflection to integrate classroom and field. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Presented is a model to teach policy practice from a human rights perspective based on a violence-against-women delegation visit to Guatemala. Postdelegation policy advocacy responses included White House and State Department briefings on the problems, including femicide. Case examples of witnessed testimony about human rights violations, including rape, femicide, and human trafficking, reflect the unique and dynamic nature of social work practice in a global context. We link Council on Social Work Education core competencies in policy practice and human rights to experiential learning strategies used by the delegation and derive lessons learned to advance human rights education for the profession.

AB- It is important to develop commitment to community practice among social work students to encourage their engagement in this field as professionals later in life. This research examines factors that affect commitment to community practice among social work students. A structured questionnaire was administered to 277 social work students in one university and one college in Israel. The findings indicate three main factors that explain variance in commitment to community practice: specific self-efficacy for this field, positive experience in a community project during training, and experience with politics. Surprisingly, theoretical studies and support for community work during supervision did not significantly contribute to explanation of commitment to community work. The findings are discussed.

AB- This article analyzes perspectives on the goals of the social work profession and social activism of a cohort of MSW students before and after attending their graduate program. This study provides insights into the question about whether and how preexisting values, experiences, and background characteristics affect beginning and ending students' views of the goals of social work and also whether they anticipate being socially active in the future, utilizing a range of strategies to effect change. It found that students from all methods began with a dual (micro and macro) view of social work goals and much activism and then left the MSW program with the same confirmed person-in-environment perspective and a commitment to all types of social activism in even greater numbers.

AB- The United States remains highly segregated, and social work students are likely to live and work in segregated contexts. What implications does this have for their cultural competence? Does segregation affect social workers' ability to serve diverse clients without bias? This article reviews two social psychology theories, aversive racism and intergroup contact, for use by social work educators. Together, these theories suggest both the likelihood of social worker prejudice within a context of segregation and an evidence-based method for improvement. The article concludes by offering strategies for incorporating both theories in cultural competence education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- A formidable body of recent literature advocates the incorporation of spirituality into the bio-psycho-social framework of social work education and practice. No consistent conceptualization of spirituality has been developed, however, that can be used with all clients and that is fully consonant with social work values as taught in schools of social work. Certain culturally derived perspectives regarding spirituality have been endorsed in social work literature in a way that does not fully honor each client's view of the nature of existence. This article proposes an inclusive definition of spirituality for social work education that considers every client's perceptions regarding what is unknowable as equally valid. Case examples, suitable for classroom education, are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article reviews the literature regarding discrimination by social work practitioners and educators against evangelical Christian social workers. We examine the methodology of articles that compare religiosity and political ideology between social workers and the general population and also of articles that address discrimination against evangelical Christians in social work education. Our results indicate that there are limited studies to support arguments that such discrimination exists and that these studies have significant methodological weaknesses. We conclude that the claims about social work and social workers discriminating against evangelical Christians are not supported by a sufficient body of rigorous research.

AB- The current study investigates the relationships between three indicators of religious involvement and three aspects of spiritual caregiving awards and multiple measures of caregiver stress, internal and external resources, and physical and mental health among older (60+) African American caregivers of elders. Findings show that both factors are associated with the three caregiving areas, although spiritual rewards emerged as having more linkages than religious involvement. Further analysis showed significant relationships between the two independent variables of religious involvement and spiritual rewards, suggesting possible interactive effects on the caregiving experience. Implications for social work practice and research are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Content on religion and spirituality among African Americans is largely absent from the curricula of social work programs. African Americans' unique relationship with faith makes knowledge of religion and spirituality critical for social workers attempting to establish an effective professional relationship with clients for whom these are important areas of their lives. Because content on understanding, assessing and incorporating spirituality into the helping process is not readily available to social workers as students, the professional literature should certainly be a ready source for the provision of useful and relevant information. This article reports the results of a content analysis of 6 mainstream social work journals related to material on religion, spirituality, and the Black Church in the lives of African Americans. The findings indicate a poverty of content on these topics which could hinder practitioners' opportunities for success with African American Christian clients. Opportunities to expand dissemination of the content are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Many Christian leaders have asserted that queer and Christian are two mutually exclusive identities. Several studies have explored how gay men navigate conflicting spiritual and sexual identities. The same research does not exist for queer women. This study included 8 qualitative interviews of lesbian and bisexual women who grew up in nonaffirming Christian environments, and currently describe their spiritual practice as meaningful and affirming. Participants all shared negative experiences with Christianity, and a spiritual journey that resulted in profoundly meaningful spiritual lives. Implications suggest that social workers can offer a safe place for LGBTQ clients to address their spiritual issues. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The purpose of this empirical research was to investigate a postmodern approach of teaching spirituality diversity to Masters of Social Work (MSW) students. A modified reflecting team intervention was utilized as a way for MSW students to learn about spirituality diversity and awareness in the classroom. Results of this quasi-experimental design indicated that when a reflecting team format was utilized to discuss issues of spirituality development and diversity among MSW students they experienced less anxiety and increased personal levels of self-efficacy simultaneously. Ongoing research needs to explore if this pedagogy facilitates increased MSW understanding and awareness of belief system difference and if it can serve as a parallel process for students in the field.

AB- Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregivers experience immense burden and stress while supporting their loved ones with AD. Those who successfully manage the negative stressors related to AD caregiving are often highly resilient. The purpose of this study was to reevaluate the psychometric properties of the Spiritual Support Scale (SSS) among a sample of 691 AD caregivers in the southern United States. The AD caregiver population is relevant to this measure given their traditional, frequent use of spirituality as a coping resource. Data was collected by self-reported questionnaires. The psychometric strength of SSS was examined by analyzing factor structure and evaluating its reliability and validity. Results showed that a single factor was identified on which all items of the scale loaded. The SSS showed strong reliability and evidence of construct validity. Results from this study confirmed the strong psychometric properties of the SSS reported in the original study. The SSS appears to be a viable measure in assessing the extent of spiritual support in the lives of social work clientele.

AB- Social work continues to move towards the incorporation of spirituality within social work theory and practice, yet gaps remain at many levels. The current dearth of theorization of spirituality in social work has created a situation where individual social workers wishing to include spirituality in their practice are forced to rely on their own initiative and inventiveness, with no clear theoretical, practical, or ethical guidelines. This article presents the beginnings of an integrated spiritual practice framework which may help to address some of these concerns. This research scrutinized the proposed Integrated Spiritual Practice Framework (ISPF) through literature survey of three spiritual ideologies (Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism) using the process of metatriangulation. The study found that each ideological perspective provided evidence and support for the structures and concepts of the ISPF. Through the analysis and theory building process, each ideology contributed greater understanding of components of the ISPF, resulting in a more sophisticated and developed framework for integrating spirituality within social work.

AB- Cyber counseling is a new and growing medium for offering mental health services to children and youth. However, there is a lack of identification of the core competencies required to provide effective online counseling. A school of social work, in partnership with a national service agency providing online counseling to children and youth, developed and offered a 13-week course to participating MSW social work students and agency staff. The development of online counseling competencies was assessed through individual interviews with participants and a content analysis of online posts. Participants scored well in areas of assessment and intervention. Challenges were identified in relationship building within an online environment. This research was funded by Bell Canada.

AB- Efficient and practical means of disseminating research to social workers are needed. The authors examined how 10 social work and 10 other helping profession association websites used their sites to disseminate research to their members. A rubric was used to rate the websites in 4 domains: (1) promotion, (2) accessibility, (3) dissemination, and (4) linkages to credible research information. Findings reveal that online dissemination of research by these professional associations is lacking. Recommendations include use of a prominent research tab on the homepage, inclusion of research syntheses, and links to additional research resources. Professional associations must improve their websites to become the foremost portals by which social workers stay informed of the most current research in their respective practice areas.

AB- The 2004 CaliforniaMental Health Services Act requires large-scale system change in the public mental health system through a shift to recovery-oriented services for diverse populations. This article describes an innovative strategy for workforce recruitment and retention to create and sustain these systemic changes. The California Social Work Education Center Mental Health Program provides stipends to master's of social work students at 17 California universities. In return, students must work for 1 year postgraduation in community mental health practice. Results of a 5-year study show that stipend recipients closely mirror the diverse demographics of the state, and 94% have remained in community mental health practice. The article also discusses lessons learned and implications for social work education in California and other states. Gwen Foster is director of the Mental Health Program and Meghan Brenna Morris and Sirojudin Sirojudin are doctoral candidates at the University of California, Berkeley. The authors wish to acknowledge the generous contributions to the initial phases of the study and the development of this article by James Midgley, Harry and Riva Specht Professor of Public Social Services and Dean Emeritus, University of California, Berkeley School of Social Welfare, and Anupama Jacob, doctoral student at University of California, Berkeley School of Social Welfare.

AB- This study consists of an oral history project that partnered MSW students with community dwelling older adults from diverse backgrounds. It used a comparison group with a pretest and posttest design and a sample of 74 MSW students to evaluate changes in their confidence levels, future plans of working with older adults, and geriatric competencies. Results of MANOVAs revealed that participation in the oral history project was significantly related to future career plans, confidence about working with diverse older adults, and geriatric competencies related to diversity, particularly for the experimental group. Exposing social work students to a broad-based curriculum with aging content has important implications toward fostering students’ interests in pursuing social work practice with older adults and in preparing them for culturally competent social work.

AB- The purpose of this study was to revalidate an existing measure of knowledge, attitudes, and use of evidence-based practice (EBP) developed for medical students. Adapted to reflect social work, questionnaires were obtained from undergraduate and graduate social work students (n = 134) and field instructors (n = 50). All 4 factors (21 items) related to EBP (knowledge, attitude, personal use, and future use) showed good reliability, and overall reliability was .86. MSW students rated their knowledge and use of EBP significantly higher than BSW students and field instructors did, but the groups were similar on attitudes and future use of EBP. The Knowledge, Attitudes, Behavior Scale questionnaire is a useful tool for social work programs that can be used to monitor the impact of EBP curricular efforts.

However, few studies have examined the content of social work program websites. This exploratory study aimed to answer the question: Are EBP efforts in social work reflected on school websites? A guided content analysis of 40 randomly selected websites for schools of social work was used to identify how training, implementation, dissemination, and research related to EBP were represented through this medium. Implications for social work education, practice, and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Field practicum is an active learning process. This study explores the different learning stages or processes students experience during their field practicum. First-year master's of social work students in field practica were asked how much they had engaged in educational learning activities such as observation, working independently, process recordings, and conceptual linkage activities for their practice. Forty-eight students completed a questionnaire three times over the first-year field practicum. The results showed that observation and process recording decreased over the time points. However, most of the participatory activities and conceptual linkage activities increased. Conceptual linkage activities were more strongly related to learning outcomes than observational or participatory activities. The discussion includes suggestions for enhancing student learning over the course of the field practicum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study offers a unique perspective on assessment of learning by comparing results from direct and indirect measures in a social work graduate program across two campuses of a single university. The findings suggest that students’ perceptions of learning are not necessarily reflective of content and applied skills mastery. Perception of learning appears to be a separate construct from actual learning, and it may reflect the students’ satisfaction with their experiences in the program, rather than their attainment of content and skills. Thus, students’ satisfaction with their educational experience deserves the attention of educators and administrators who are interested in improving program quality.

AB- The financial literacy of social work students has become the focus of curriculum development and research, but no study to date has attempted to assess the financial knowledge possessed by social work students. This study addressed that gap by assessing the level of objective financial knowledge reported by social work student respondents (N = 1,506) to an Internet-based survey. Results indicated that the majority of social work student respondents scored more than 70% correct on a 48-item measure of financial literacy. Multiple regression analysis explained 33.7% of the variance and suggested that the dominant pathway to acquiring objective financial knowledge is through personal experience. Accordingly, financial education programs for social work students may be most appropriate for traditional undergraduates.

AB- Research suggests that better educational preparation is necessary to assure that health care social workers have the competencies essential for high quality interdisciplinary palliative care practice. This study is a qualitative evaluation of those elements contributing to competence and confidence in interdisciplinary practice skills of second year MSW students. Analysis of student narratives yielded two prominent themes: (1) social work students’ relationships to members of other disciplines, which included understanding of other professions’ knowledge and scope of practice as well as respect for and from professionals of other disciplines, and (2) the social work students’ self-representation as members of the profession and identities as team members. These study findings support the creation of courses that include students from disciplines represented in palliative care. This project was conducted with support from The ACE Project-Advocating for Clinical Excellence-Transdisciplinary Palliative Care Education.

AB- Professional socialization has become a notable construct for social work with the publication of the Council on Social Work Education's (2008) revised Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards. Though historically regarded as essential, little is known about the professional socialization of social workers. This article presents professional socialization as a key element that bridges the explicit and implicit curricula. Results from this study provide empirical support for a theoretical framework of the professional socialization of social workers with a particular focus on factors that predict professional socialization, which is defined as a multidimensional, temporal construct beginning before formal education and continuing after it, with values, attitudes, and professional identity as outcomes. Implications for social work education, development of systematic research in this area, and recruitment and retention are discussed.

AB- This article introduces contemplative silence and the wholeness of being into critical social work education. It draws on in-depth interviews with students 1 year after the completion of a course to reflect on the impact of contemplative practice and mindfulness practice on the students’ personal lives and critical social work practice. Students’ reflection shows the power of contemplative pedagogy and mindfulness in deepening their awareness through the 5 senses: sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste. They came to embody critical reflective practice in a way that is not achieved to the same depth through conventional teaching and learning of critical practice with only the mind.

AB- In the context of religious and spiritual communities that may marginalize those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ), we explore how 11 women reconfigured potentially conflicting spiritual and sexual/gender identities. Interviews with women in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Canada’s East coast, indicated some used faith traditions to try to change themselves, but most found ways to disengage from or alter their spiritual relationships. Many losses were entailed as women rejected or were discarded by faith communities. In reconfiguring their spiritual lives, women drew from former traditions, explored new paths, and forged individual relationships to the spiritual.

Both social work and ministry have increasingly emphasized a sense of call or vocation, field work and internships, and specific credentials for practice. Sociologically, both social work and ministry can be framed as socialization into the helping professions, into the midlevel professions, and into the bureaucratic professions, with maintenance of socialization taking place through similar professional associations and continuing education. Implications for social work education and educational policy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study explores religious teachings about same-sex sexuality, religiosity, and contact with gay, lesbian, or bisexual (GLB) friends on attitudes toward lesbians and gay men among Catholic and Protestant social work students. Data from a convenience sample (n = 383) from four universities were analyzed. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicate that age, Protestant religious affiliation, religiosity, religious message about homosexuality, contact with GLB, and the cross product of religiosity and religious message were significant. The adjusted analysis for the latter variable indicates that those exposed to more accepting messages reported less bias, and the effect of antigay messages was greatest among highly religious students.

AB- This article explores moral injury, a concept from military mental health professionals, which refers to the emotional effects on soldiers of actions taken as part of their military obligations that violate the dictates of their moral compass (Boudreau, 2011; Shay, 2011). This article will trace the history and current knowledge of moral injury and apply a social cognitive model of understanding the concept (Litz et al., 2009) to vignettes from the authors’ civilian clinical practice, in the hope of raising awareness within clinical social work and other mental health professions of the complexities of moral injury. By brining the concept of moral injury into the mainstream social work arena, it is the authors’ hope that clinicians will be able to distinguish it from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and understand the role of shame in the experience of moral injury in their own clients.

The interface between indigenous spirituality and social work is an extraordinarily rich area for scholarly work. Although significant attention has been paid to the major religious and spiritual traditions in the context of spiritually sensitive practice, this issue highlights minority spiritualities and their salience to social work practice. Although there remains much more work to be done to illuminate minority spirituality globally, the articles in this Special Edition attest that there is a clear link between minority spirituality, healing, well-being, and social work. The contributors to this Special Edition have brought light to this promising partnership and have highlighted the need for social work to respectfully welcome indigenous spirituality and their healing methodologies in the same vein as Eurocentric paradigms.

AB- The Patient Affordable Care Act (2011) is a move towards equitable access to health care for citizens in the United States, but it is not without controversy. The mandate for shared responsibility and specifically coverage of reproductive health services for women has raised serious opposition. In June of 2011 the Brookings Project on Religion, Policy, and Politics brought together theologians, moral philosophers, legal scholars, health practitioners and advocates reflecting personal perspectives on all sides of the debate. This thoughtful examination of tension between religious leaders, health care advocates sets a backdrop with which to view inherent conflict with social work’s professional paradigm of social justice and its historical ties to organized religion.

AB- One issue raised by the Brookings Report: Health Care Providers’ Conscience and Patient Needs: The Quest for Balance, was the role of personal conscience in moral conflicts. Conscience, as so defined, is heavily influenced by personal philosophical beliefs and values. Social Work has historically, proposed values as a both a means of professional definition and to differentiate itself from other helping professions. Several significant issues, however, create problems for utilizing specific values as a true core feature of the social work profession. One possible solution is the implementation of an organizing principle; specifically social justice. There is ample evidence for the utilization of social justice as such a principle or value, from both the social work literature and the philosophical study of justice. By incorporating a broad conception of social justice it becomes possible for many perspectives and dimensions of social justice to be applied in specific situations and still maintain a cohesive, comprehensive understanding of the social work profession that remains true to its historical foundations.

AB- In this article, the author responds to the Brooking Report by addressing how beliefs can become ideologies that harm. Beliefs are conceptualized as processes that probably evolved to support the survival and well-being of our ancestors, but that today can either help or harm us. The author introduces the concept of “ideological identification disorder” (IDD), which involves a belief I value above all other beliefs. In IDD, I not only value my ideology identification over my other beliefs, but I may well value it over other people, living things, and the world I live in. Our conservative and progressive beliefs, for example, can serve individuals, families, and communities. However, when they become “ideology identifications,” they can harm individuals, groups, and local and global communities. The local and global challenges humanity faces today require collaboration between people. Ideology identification tends to destroy the kinds of relationships that foster collaboration. A practice model framework is provided that addresses the transformation of ideology identification, at the micro-, mezzo-, and macro-levels of change. In this transformation process, people can develop “healthy beliefs” that are tempered with responsibility toward both ourselves and one another. Such beliefs may foster more effective collaboration between people. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- A central question implicitly raised by Galston and Roger’s (2012) report, Heath care providers’ consciences and patients’ needs: The quest for balance can be stated as follows: How can the members of an increasingly diverse society interact in a peaceful, civil manner? As the United States becomes more religiously diverse, conscience-based conflicts between service providers and recipients are likely to increase. How should the social work profession respond to such conflicts? Although many societal actors endorse the use of coercion, this article recommends a different approach. It suggests a human rights-based approach is the best way to deal with these conflicts while also simultaneously fostering a society that respects and affirms diversity. The article concludes with two case examples to illustrate the benefits of this approach for social worker practitioners and their clients.

It defines educational journal clubs and discusses the history of journal clubs in medical education and the applicability of the model to social work education. The feasibility of implementing journal clubs in a school of social welfare is highlighted. The journal club received high ratings on student evaluations indicating participants thought it was a valuable addition to their education. Journal clubs align with the program mission and goals of the Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) set forth by the Council of Social Work Education (CSWE), and they can be an affordable, easily implemented, and sustainable supplement to traditional research curricula.

AB- There is a dearth of research on social work students' attitudes toward lesbians and gays in East Asian countries where intolerance toward nonheterosexuality has been documented. This article presents findings from the first study in Hong Kong using a Chinese version of Herek's Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men Scale (ATLG) to measure attitudes toward lesbian and gay men of 462 Chinese social work students. We found that students' attitudes were generally favorable toward lesbians and gay men. Students with Christian beliefs tended to hold negative attitudes, though exposure to sexual diversity training was found to be significantly associated with favorable attitudes. The authors discuss implications of social work education in Hong Kong with reference to its unique cultural context. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Entering (n = 475) and graduating (n = 454) students at 3 master's of social work programs in the northeast were compared regarding their knowledge and attitudes concerning working with substance abusing clients. In comparison to entering students, graduating students demonstrated modestly higher levels of knowledge, role adequacy, and role legitimacy, but less desire to work with this population. A multivariate analysis revealed numerous factors that affected students' knowledge and attitudes: gender; ethnicity; exposure to substance abuse through family, friends, or self; taking a substance abuse course in an academic setting; having an internship in a substance abuse setting; substance abuse training outside of an academic setting; and exposure to substance abusers through employment. Implications of these findings for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In recent years, there has been an increased call to refine social work curricula to better prepare social workers to enter the field with the skills necessary to effectively respond to the needs of survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. This study's purpose is to present the results of an evaluation of a newly developed, specialized social work course on violence against women to determine whether it positively impacts MSW students' attitudes, beliefs, and professional efficacy as compared to other courses. This study provides a description of the specialized course and presents the results of a quasi-experimental evaluation of the course with 179 graduating social work students. The study concludes with implications for social work educators and researchers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

In this study standardized clients (actors) were used to train Army civilian social workers in evidence-based assessment of IPV and in the evaluation of the curriculum's effectiveness, Participation in this training curriculum increased the following: the participants' knowledge about the empirical basis for content areas explored in IPV assessment, their exploration of content critical to an IPV assessment interview, and their interviewing process skills. The results support the effectiveness of using standardized clients in IPV assessment training and evaluation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Despite the congruence between critical feminist values and the cardinal values of the social work profession, feminist research in social work has lagged behind its feminist cousins in the social sciences, particularly in terms of critical uses of theory, reflexivity, and the troubling of binaries. This article presents as praxis our reflections as researchers, teachers, and feminists inside social work. We draw from a review of feminist social work research and offer suggestions for teaching critical feminist approaches in social work research. Incorporating critical feminist values and research practices into social work research courses creates the potential for greater integration of research, practice, and the principal values of our profession.

AB- This article reviews themes and changes in the teaching of HIV/AIDS content in social work programs over the first three decades of the epidemic. Social work education in the first decade of the epidemic was largely focused on helping clients in the death and dying process, while medical and pharmaceutical advancements in the mid-1990s drastically altered the roles of social work. As social work education prepares students to face the fourth decade of the AIDS epidemic, three areas of cross-curricular intersection are highlighted: HIV/AIDS as an issue of social, racial, and economic justice; the global AIDS epidemic in the context of international social work; and the social work response to HIV/AIDS in older adults.

AB- A qualitative research project was carried out to investigate how first-year graduate students integrated their field work learning with their classroom leaning (N = 17). The study reveals the students' difficulty in integrating their practical learning with theoretical classroom knowledge. Using grounded theory analysis, two types of student reactions to integrating knowledge were found: role confusion and role clarity; most fit into the role confusion group. Performing supportive social work, working with involuntary clients, and the age of the client were all linked to the students' role confusion. Implications for teaching strategies using reflective practice are discussed, as well as possible connections between beginning students' confusion, ageism, and lack of interest in the field of aging.

AB- California has actively engaged in the Hartford Geriatric Social Work Initiative. Subsequently, the California Social Work Education Center Aging Initiative conducted a university survey of gerontology education in California graduate social work schools (N = 17), In 2005, students taking aging courses were 12% in comparison to a national report of 7% by the Council on Social Work Education and an earlier 1993 national survey of 3%. Still, the number of gerontology students remains less than needed numbers. However, California social work schools are well-prepared with infused curricula for all social workers and exceed previous standards for gerontology faculty and aging field placements. The implications for California are discussed as well as recommendations for updating the earlier gerontology curricula criteria.

AB- This study explores the relationship between social work education and a propensity of social workers to leave the profession. A convenience sample was drawn from alumni lists in the mid-South of the United States, with 785 participants completing a Web-based survey. This survey included items specific to demographic information and level of satisfaction with academic rigor of social work education. Results indicate that social workers who left, or intended to leave the profession, rated the quality of their social work education significantly lower than those who remained in the profession. In addition, those who remained in the profession held a significantly greater number of licenses than those who left. Implications and recommendations for social work education, practice, and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The researchers conducted an exploratory study using grounded theory qualitative research methods to examine experiences of social work doctoral students as they learned to teach (N = 14). A core category, learning through experience, representing a basic social process, was identified. The doctoral students experienced learning in three different areas: learning to establish authority, developing an effective teaching style, and integrating the broader context of social work education. This article provides detailed descriptions of learning through experience in each of these areas. Implications for improving educational opportunities for doctoral students pursuing careers in academia are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article contributes to discourse on signature pedagogy by reconceptualizing how our pedagogies are understood and defined for social work education. We critique the view that field education is social work's signature pedagogy and consider what pedagogies are distinct about the teaching and learning of social work. Using Shulman's work on professional education, we offer a conceptualization that rests on the belief about the necessary outcome of our pedagogy—it must enable students to think and perform like social workers through the development of the professional self. We present a framework that focuses on three integrating features: thinking and performing like a social worker, development of the professional self, and characteristic forms of teaching and learning.

AB- Research has shown that spirituality and religion are important sources of resilience and coping in adversity such as disasters, particularly for African Americans. In addition, churches and faith-based service providers are key actors in disaster relief and recovery. After Hurricane Katrina, research on survivors has focused little on the role of spirituality and religion in their recovery. This case study illustrates that even without soliciting it, survivors who evacuated to a host city talked about the importance of spirituality and religion in their recovery process. Further, interviews and observations with local service providers illustrate that few practitioners utilized spirituality or religion as a resource and that coordination between faith-based and secular service providers was problematic. Our research highlights a neglected area of cultural competence for those providing services to Katrina survivors. We discuss the implications for social work policy and practice.

AB- During the process of teaching theoretical foundations in a Canadian school of social work, I sought to combine my teaching of critical anti-oppressive practice (AOP) with established ideas from the field of human-animal bonds (HAB) and from the spiritual experiences arising within my relationships to companion animals. This article addresses the challenges I confronted by identifying speciesism, a specific form of discrimination based on species not recognized within social work’s anti-oppressive practice paradigm. I argue that anti-oppressive social work is, in effect, oppressive because it informs a perspective that prioritizes humans over other animals, nature, and the planet. By drawing on the extensive body of literature in the field of HAB, which like AOP is informed by critical social theories, this article highlights how an AOP approach is delimited to diversity among humans. The implication of anthropocentrism as the central organizing principle of AOP social work is that it limits the profession’s value framework and the potential for sustainable outcomes for well-being among all beings. Pathways to address these implications are offered by reference to work that explores issues of spirituality and ethics in both social work and HAB research.

AB- Social science scholarship identifies factors that predict overall subjective well-being (SWB) or happiness. Although religion and religiosity positively affect overall SWB, less attention has been given to spirituality, and no research, to date, has examined the spiritual dimensions of SWB amongst practicing social workers. Research is based on in-depth interviews with 13 social workers possessing the highest SWB, measured by a 2006 survey of 700 randomly selected social workers practicing in Alberta, Canada. Participants identified five different spiritually based aspects of their SWB: familial and childhood background; major life experiences; personal beliefs about existence and life; experiences with work and personal life balance; and professional identity and practice background. The discussion and concluding sections consider how to incorporate the findings into social work practice, theory building, and education.

AB- This paper will examine literature focused on meditation and visualization, and their impact on mental and physical health. A key aspect of this examination includes understanding the defined meanings of both meditation and visualization. Specifically, the authors explore concepts of human consciousness, including mindfulness, quantum physics realities, and controlling mental imagery in neurology. These ideas provided the conceptual framework to study the effectiveness of meditation and visualization through an 8-week program for female university students, experiencing stress, anxiety, and sadness. Initial qualitative data analysis employed a thematic analytic approach. Preliminary findings, such as increased self-awareness and decreased anxiety, are discussed alongside existing literature that confirms the value of meditation and visualization approaches towards improved health.

AB- The demands placed on human service workers in supporting people through challenging circumstances can contribute to high levels of stress and burnout. Self-care practices implemented regularly may decrease the impact of the high levels of stress while also serving as strategies for coping during particularly stressful times. The interconnections between contemplative practices, including mindfulness, as coping and preventative strategies for self-care practice among human service workers are beginning to emerge. We used a multimethod study to examine the effectiveness of eight weeks of contemplative practice training in increasing self-care, awareness, and coping strategies for 12 human service workers. Paired t-tests conducted on pre- and post-training scores on the Perceived Stress Scale and the Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale showed that mindfulness was significantly increased and that stress significantly decreased over the intervention. Thematic analysis from participant journaling and a focus group discussion suggests that time, permission, and place for learning and practicing mindfulness-based activities are necessary. A meditative model is presented to illustrate how enhanced awareness through mindfulness practice can increase self-care which can, in turn, positively affect the service human service workers provide to their clients.

AB- Holistic arts-based group methods are well suited to facilitating spiritually sensitive discussions with young people. This paper briefly describes some of these group methods that have been found to be feasible, suitable, and beneficial for children and youth living in foster care for developing aspects of their resilience. Qualitative analysis is presented and illustrates how the young people made sense of spirituality and discussed spiritually sensitive themes in the group. We found that most of the young people had ideas about spirituality and that most of the spiritually sensitive discussions could be related to issues of death and/or loss. Their narratives, however brief, offered rich material for exploration. Helping practitioners should consider how spiritually sensitive methods can occur with children/youth because young people may raise these issues themselves, spiritually sensitive issues may be integral to the problems they present, and/or may be intimately connected with their cultural beliefs and practices.

AB- This study examined the differential effects of both parents' religious service attendance on adolescent substance use. A secondary data analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997, Round 1 was conducted using a sample of 4,828 adolescents ages 12 to 16 (mean age 14 years). Results suggest that attending religious services more than once a week by both parents is associated with adolescents being less likely to use substances. Adolescents residing in households where the father never attended religious services and the mother attended religious services once a month and adolescents residing in households where the father never attended religious services and the mother attended more than once a week were almost 4 times more likely to use substances than adolescents residing in households where both parents attended religious services more than once a week. There was no evidence to support that having one parent attending religious services more than the other compensated for the effects of the low frequency attending parent. Implications for faith-based policy initiatives and practice are discussed. Future research should determine why having a more frequent attending parent did not compensate for the effects of having a low frequent attending parent on adolescent substance use.

The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand the process by which individuals with a Christian upbringing resolve conflict between their gender identity and religious beliefs. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed a model with the following fluid stages: experiencing gender socialization, having conflicts between views of self and socialized gender, defying gender norms, exploring gender and religious identities, and continually resolving issues as they arise. The article concludes with theoretical and practical implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

We used a qualitative methodology to explore the potential utility of mindfulness training in helping beginning MSW students develop clinical intervention skills. Students reported that the training helped them manage distractions and anxiety, facilitated their ability to attend and respond to the client, and encouraged them to be more self-aware and flexible in their thinking in the classroom and in the field. Mindfulness training may strengthen current cognitive and behavioral training strategies, while providing a means of integrating affective and sensory learning into the training process.

AB- This article focuses on the experiences of African American women who converted from Christianity to Islam. Examining qualitative data from interviews with 15 Muslim women, we identified common experiences the women had in their paths to Islam. These experiences included predisposing conditions, experiencing challenges, social ties and relationships with Muslims, observing others, and positive experiences during the conversion process. We also found that dissatisfaction with their religious upbringing, life events, close and distant relationships, and feelings of peacefulness entered into the process, which seemed to be gradual. Similarities and differences between these findings and models of conversion and implications for social work practice with African American Muslim women are discussed.

AB- Despite being the largest African group to resettle in the United States, there is a dearth of literature examining the influence of religion on health behaviors and beliefs among Somali refugees. Using purposive sampling methods, we examined how religious beliefs informed health behaviors among twenty Somali refugees. Using inductive analysis and coding, three primary themes were uncovered: (a) the Quran as treatment, (b) God’s will, and (c) religious prohibitions to healthcare. These findings highlight the need for social work and healthcare practitioners to be cognizant of Somali cultural practices and religious beliefs in appropriately addressing their needs.

AB- In light of the assertion that field education is the signature pedagogy of social work education, this Intemet-based study explores field director demographics and questions the fulfillment of this potential, examining BSW and MSW field education through the lens of the field director position. Field directors (159) and deans/directors (150) were asked to express their opinions on the role, function, and status of the field director. Variables included salary, job security, privileges, and authority. The findings provide evidence of a modest but statistically significant difference in perceptions between field directors and deans/directors. If field is intended to carry the prominent position of signature pedagogy, the field director and factors associated with the role will influence the trajectory.

AB- This article examines political ideology and its implications as a newer diversity variable within social work education. Responding to internal assessments and external critiques of social work education, the dynamics of how diverse political ideologies might manifest in 5 core course concentrations—human behavior in the social environment, research, practice, field education, and policy—are highlighted. The authors offer a series of critical questions, a typology for addressing political ideology, and a set of educational guidelines to assist educators, administrators, and students as they grapple with attending to political diversity in a variety of social work classrooms.

Drawing from behavioral theory in its focus on specific activities, this instrument is simple to interpret and provides clear direction for change. Based on LAQ responses and its use by 6 professors teaching 11 classes over 5 years to 215 students, suggestions are provided for how it can enhance teaching.

AB- Social workers are in a position to identify the effects of substance use disorders (SUDs) on children and families and provide appropriate interventions in broad practice contexts. Unfortunately, many social workers are not trained to consider parental SUDs and their effects on children in the assessment process. A course module for training social work students on working with children of a parent(s) who has a SUD was developed to fill this gap. This study reports on an evaluation of this module that was conducted with 52 students in baccalaureate-level Human Behavior in the Social Environment courses. Significant increases in knowledge, self-efficacy beliefs, and perceived abilities were observed, and students reported high levels of satisfaction with the module.

All stakeholders involved in the placement of students took part in a focus group and follow-up individual interviews. Findings suggest that students need to be open, flexible, self-directed, and maverick in personality. In turn, the former students felt that they had been prepared for generalist social work practice, developed their social work knowledge and their use of self, and had become more client centered and better team players as a result of their field placements in a macro rural setting. Barriers for placing students in rural macro settings are included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

In addition, we provide specific suggestions for field instructors to use with their students. Ideas from the faculty development movement known as Writing Across the Curriculum provide tools that are easily applicable to field education.

The theoretical underpinnings and a discussion of the implementation of each stage of the model is provided. The authors consider the implications of this model for student understanding of privilege, oppression, and power and the use of antioppressive community practice approaches through the development of specific communities of practice. The development of transformative learning that included the students, the instructor, and community members is also highlighted.

The sample included students from 3 accredited programs in a southeastern state in the United States, 1 large urban-based public university with BSW and MSW programs, and 2 small, rural, faith-based institutions with BSW programs. A typology of 4 categories was used for the study. Findings have pertinence for the social work profession as it continues to explicate its moral obligation as a service provider and for social work education as it suggests the further development of a curriculum model that relates to the principles of structural justice.

AB- This article explores the ethical tensions and dilemmas that arose for 2 U.S. social work students during an 8-month international clinical internship in northern Uganda. These students encountered cultural differences related to issues of confidentiality, autonomy, and self-determination. Student experiences were analyzed using the cultural orientation framework of collectivism. A strategy for reflecting on ethical dilemmas that arose is presented involving identification and exploration of the ethical dilemma, reflection on the dilemma in the context of culture and socioeconomic factors, development of culturally responsive and ethical interventions, and continued review and reflection. Such exploration of culturally based value differences is needed to increase social work students' cultural competence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

This project included conducting practicum supervision and seminars via videoconferencing (using Breeze, Adobe Connect, and Skype) and developing peer e-mail and Facebook partnerships to link students from both continents. This paper explores the benefits to participating students who engaged the structured use of technology to expand their social work and cultural knowledge while also developing international friendships. As technology continues to advance, social work educators must be on the forefront of connecting students by bridging the hemispheres through the use of technology.

AB- Social work programs are increasingly relying on study abroad to prepare students for global practice. A growing body of literature reports on the positive features of international education, yet little attention has been focused on preparing social work programs and the faculty who lead them to handle the emergencies that can arise during study abroad. This paper uses a case study of an actual emergency in a study abroad program to examine how the event was handled and to assess its short- and long-term consequences. Elements of the case are analyzed in an effort to identify general issues for study abroad programs to consider. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The social work profession has a long standing commitment to human rights and social justice, bridging the divide between national and international interests. There is a call for social workers to understand the global community that awaits our service. Yet international experiences are not within the grasp of nor embraced by all. Students of color are underrepresented participants in the growing trends of internationalization. Through addressing participation barriers, this article uses a case study approach that emphasizes how a social work program at Howard University designed a mission-guided international service learning model that resulted in increased participation for students of color through multiple strategies, while giving primacy to human rights and social justice.

AB- Despite a growing emphasis on international offerings within social work education, researchers have conducted few outcomes studies regarding the implications of these courses for students’ professional development. This study addressed this gap by analyzing data from a survey of 122 social work students at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, before and after they completed (a) a guided study-abroad course or (b) an on-campus course on international social work. Results indicated that students in both courses demonstrated gains across multiple domains, including self-rated skills, understanding of international service, identification as a global citizen, and empowerment. Students in the study abroad courses demonstrated greater gains in self-rated skills than students in the on-campus course.

The purpose of this study was to assess quantitatively the effect on bachelor students' cross-cultural adaptability using a pre-post design. Significant changes were found on all subscales as well as on the total score, thus supporting the use of these short-term trips for this purpose.

AB- Scholars have questioned the validity of universal social work values and the manner in which international welfare interventions manage basic needs without affecting structural change. This article examines a class on engaging with sex workers in India that was informed by the critiques of normative international welfare engagement. The analysis drew on qualitative interviews with 18 participants, students’ written responses, and the instructor's field notes. Results indicate that structural factors, the class material, and the class format helped students immerse themselves in community life, challenge preconceptions about the community, validate beliefs and ideologies that emerged out of the lived experience of sex workers, and engage in social change. Implications for international social work education and pedagogy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Furthermore, what can students learn from hearing how students from other countries view them? Social work students in the United States, Botswana, and Malawi were video-recorded; they then viewed the videos of students at other sites and responded. The African students had personal experiences of HIV/AIDS, whereas those in the United States had little contact with people living with HIV/AIDS. Students in all locations revealed culturally constructed meanings and beliefs in associated myths regarding HIV/AIDS. The process of viewing students of different cultures is illustrated as an effective pedagogical approach toward increasing students' global learning and could be replicated using discussion of other international challenges.

It reviews international concepts of well-being as well as those within social work to consider a deeper exploration of the meanings of well-being. Dimensions of well-being that resonate with social work values include eliminating poverty; promoting social inclusion and eliminating oppression; eliminating all forms of violence in society; increasing investments in health, education, and social supports; and the protection and restoration of environmental resources and the biosphere. Frameworks for incorporating concepts of well-being in social work practice, research, and teaching are proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Globalization, internationalization, and regionalization affect domestic social work. This paper explores how undergraduate students perceive international aspects of their social work education. A questionnaire was distributed to social work undergraduates in Stockholm, Sweden (n=97), and Darmstadt, Germany (n=43). Results showed that a majority of students in Sweden were prepared to work with immigrants and refugees. A majority of students in both countries wanted more education about refugee social work and social work in other countries. The amount of exchange activities was modest, but many students could consider working abroad. Students related most strongly to international aspects of domestic social work such as work with immigrants and refugees.

AB- China's social work education dates back to the 1920s, but the profession disappeared for 36 years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Not until the late 1980s was social work education in China revived. At the turn of the new century, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council supported the urgent need for social work professionals to solve serious social problems to build what the government called a harmonious society. Since then, China's social work education has gone through rapid development. We examine the characteristics of China's social work education development since the economic reform of 1978 and present the challenges, opportunities, and future prospects for the profession.

AB- Peoples’ engagement with space and place is explored in this paper through the description of, and reflection upon, experiences of visiting a tiny island in the Scottish Hebrides, which has been described as a “thin place,” referring to the thinness of the boundary between this world and the spiritual world. Combining narrative practice and auto-ethnography, elements of stories are presented and situated within a framework influenced by Celtic spirituality and post-modern geography. These preliminary findings from this exploratory study contribute to the literature that suggests integrating spirituality and the nonhuman environment into social work and narrative practices.

AB- This article discusses the experiences of members of six dyads of adolescent mothers and their mothers, residing together in three generational households, related to religion and spirituality. Using a grounded theory approach, grandmothers emphasized their reliance on organized religion or spirituality, although teenaged mothers did not share this perspective. The grandmothers, functioning as the family matriarch, wanted to socialize their grandchildren in faith. This merits further study about the transmission of religious values in three generational family systems and holds implications for faith communities in meeting congregant needs and for social workers in integrating religious and spiritual interventions with mothers.

Although 93.3% of respondents said they provide pastoral counseling to military families, only 35.6% said their church has a military ministry. The number one topic (80.5%) out of 16 that military families wanted to discuss during pastoral counseling was marital discord.

AB- This study explored the role of stress and coping on the psychological well-being of 316 older adults in assisted living. Hierarchical regression revealed that high stress was significantly associated with high depression and low life satisfaction, while high levels of social support and spiritual coping mechanisms were significantly related to low depression and high life satisfaction. The findings indicated the necessity of appropriate assessment and intervention for older adults with stressful events and psychological distress. However, there is a lack of trained professionals to improve older adults’ ability to cope with their problems. Practice and policy implications are discussed.

Themes from the qualitative data include: scheduling, time factors, discomfort in the group setting, and group composition. Integral Theory (Wilber, 2006) is offered as a useful way to conceptualize spirituality-related interventions that incorporate the organizational context. The authors’ experience calls for increased partnership with organizations, engaging the interest of providers in spirituality-related interventions that could be studied within the agency setting.

AB- A diverse faculty is a goal of all social work programs. However, recruiting and retaining diverse faculty is often a struggle. In this article, narratives of 3 recent doctoral graduates are analyzed to identify the role that diversity played in their academic job searches. Autoethnographic analysis revealed 2 broad themes: identity and institutional/structural issues. The narratives explore being the potential “diversity hire” and difficulties related to identity negotiation. Issues related to disciplinary and departmental politics as well as structural concerns are represented in the narratives. This study highlights the multiple challenges for minority faculty candidates and the work that still needs to be done to honor diversity and to integrate it into a faculty and institution.

AB- This exploratory study surveyed 17 BSW-level field instructors on their experience, beliefs, and perceived self-efficacy regarding evidence-based practice (EBP). The authors conducted focus groups concerning EBP in participants’ agencies and with BSW students under their supervision. Results indicate that although they felt positive toward EBP and reported moderate levels of perceived self-efficacy regarding EBP, implementation occurred in a piecemeal fashion, if at all. Factors identified to enhance EBP in the agencies include training, resources, supervision, matching EBP to client populations, and trust between administrators and staff members. According to our study, students’ experience with EBP in field settings could probably be facilitated by students' research readiness, collaboration between field instructors and faculty, access to university resources, and training.

AB- Entering and exiting BSW students were compared on self-efficacy and on direct practice skill performance with a standardized client. Self-efficacy was tested as a predictor and as a mediator of skill performance. Ordinary least squares hierarchical regression found BSW education to be predictive of higher skill and higher self-efficacy. After controlling for BSW education, self-efficacy negatively predicted direct practice skill, and mediation was not supported as hypothesized. This study suggests caution in the use of self-efficacy as an outcome measure, advances the use of standardized clients for assessment, and affirms the need for the development of valid and reliable instruments for assessment of direct practice skill in social work education.

AB- A review of literature related to the existence of an invisible college community among coauthors of articles in top-rated social work journals indicated that an invisible college could promote quality scholarship but that coauthoring might be inadequately studied or valued in social work education. Social network analysis revealed a skeletal piece of the top-rated social work journal coauthor network, visualized it, documented its growth between the overlapping periods 2001-2005 and 2004-2008, and associated that growth with increasing citations of networked coauthors. Possible continued growth of the invisible college suggests the need to examine coauthoring, the means of evaluating coauthor contributions, and the content of social work scholarship.

AB- This article describes one MSW program's innovative and informed response to the pervasive problem of inadequate professional writing skills. We articulate the rationale, implementation, and assessment of our systemic response, which includes (a) requiring a professional writing course, (b) implementing curricular infusion of a standard writing rubric, (c) using sequential papers and peer reviews, (d) incorporating writing assessment into admissions decisions and culminating projects, (e) collaborating with the university writing center, (f) offering a writing coach, and (g) mentoring students for professional scholarship. This curricular case example provides specific and comprehensive strategies for other programs to address this ubiquitous educational concern, demonstrates adherence to CSWE's (2008) Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards in multiple dimensions, and contributes to literature on curriculum development.

AB- Suicide is a profound worldwide public health problem that has received increased attention in recent years. The major federal response, the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, calls for more suicide education for mental health professionals, including social workers. Little is known about the amount of suicide education in MSW curricula nationwide. This study presents quantitative findings from 2 national surveys of MSW deans and directors and of MSW faculty on suicide education and qualitative findings from a series of faculty focus groups. Results suggest that MSW students receive 4 or fewer hours of suicide education in graduate school, and most deans and faculty do not have plans to increase suicide content. Barriers include lack of faculty expertise, crowded curricula, and other educational priorities. Implications are discussed.

AB- International field placements are a unique educational opportunity for social work students to develop the skills they need for social work practice in a globalized world; however, outcomes of international placements have not been rigorously studied. This article reports on the International Volunteer Impacts Survey (IVIS), a 48-item survey administered to 983 respondents that measures perceived outcomes of international service. Using factor analysis procedures, the authors assess factor structure and reliability of major outcomes of international service including international contacts, open-mindedness, international understanding, intercultural relations, life plans, civic activism, community engagement, media attentiveness, and financial contributions. Further development of the IVIS and the implications for using it to assess student outcomes in international social work field placements are discussed.

It used a probability sample of 245 New Jersey LCSWs and the Social Work Values Survey as part of an anonymous self-administered mail survey. Descriptive analyses revealed that most LCSWs reported social work,values that included the use of a holistic and systems approach and social justice. Inferential analyses revealed that clinical social workers who were women with MSW degrees reported higher mean rank scores oh their decision to enter clinical practice compared to clinical social workers who were men with PhDs. The implications for practice and education are delineated. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Although individual susceptibility to burnout within a similar structural context is well-documented in other helping professions, little is known about the relationship between personal attributes and burnout in social work. Furthermore, despite a large number of entering MSW students with prior work experience, there is a paucity of research documenting the burnout phenomenon among them. By using a sample of MSW students with prior work experience (N = 60), the current study examined the effect of personal attributes on burnout (i.e., overidentification tendency, trait anxiety, and emotional contagion). Findings imply that burnout depends on personal attributes, rooted in cognitive role-taking levels, and that emotional contagion has a significant role in burnout. Implications for social work education and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Results revealed significant improvement in student knowledge and general attitudes after the course and indicated that increased knowledge about schizophrenia was only related to general attitudinal improvement when accompanied by increased personal social contact.

AB- This article describes the results of a study comparing attitudes toward mental illness and perceptions of professional danger among new social work students (n = 64) and other university students (n = 111). Such topics have implications for social work education and curriculum development but have not been studied adequately. Results from multivariate analyses showed that new social work students generally had more positive attitudes toward serious mental illness. They had less fear, were less avoidant, and were more willing to help people with severe mental illness than other students. There were no differences in other attitudes, however, including the dangers posed by mental illness and the perceived dangerousness of the social work profession. Implications for educating social work students are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Despite field placement being the signature pedagogy of the social work profession, little research exists regarding methods for training field instructors. This study captures their perceptions regarding the use of online training. An online survey of 642 field instructors from 4 universities produced 208 responses. Less than 4% rejected the idea entirely, 14% responded they "would probably not participate," another 50% said they "might participate," and 32% indicated that they "definitely would" participate. Respondents reported extensive use of various Internet communication tools and displayed comfort with computing skills. Our findings challenge assumptions about social workers' reluctance to use online technology and suggest that online training programs are a viable option for field instructors. Implications for creating online programs are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article describes the development of an ethics scale that measures adherence to social work ethical choices in specific situations. The purpose of this instrument is to provide data that demonstrate adherence to curriculum standards as set forth by the Council on Social Work Education. The authors present the conceptual framework from which the scale is derived and discuss methodological issues. Results from a pilot study demonstrate good scale reliability and content validity. Results reveal there are significant differences among various cohorts of students and that this ethics scale is a valid and reliable tool for assessing development of ethical awareness among students and alumni of social work programs. The authors discuss implications for educational assessment and future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- We propose that a targeted and structured explication of empathy is a useful, if not essential, foundation for social work theory and practice. We outline a social work framework for empathy, one that is rooted in an interdisciplinary context, emphasizes recent findings in the field of social cognitive neuroscience, and yet is embedded in a social work context. The framework lends itself to identifiable education components that social work educators can implement across the curriculum. We can help students understand the basic process of neural pathway development that determines their affective empathic responses and develop and maintain cognitive empathic abilities. In addition, students can learn to use their knowledge, values, and skills, informed by empathy, to take empathic action consciously.

AB- Although racial discrimination poses a devastating instrument of oppression, social work texts lack a clear and consistent definition of race. The solution lies in according race the status of an "actor version" concept, while exploring the origins and variations of race ideas using "scientific observer version" explanations. This distinction provides the means for determining the sources of harmful race ideas, an indispensable first step in combating them. Using recent teaching materials, we can emphasize our common humanity to promote social justice without sacrificing our recognition of the damage inflicted by racial ideas.

Findings revealed differing understandings about this responsibility as well as factors in the institution that were reported to constrain the ability of social work educators to meet this responsibility. In addition, interviewees observed that many educators may be underprepared to engage their students in this regard. Implications for further research and recommendations for CSWE-accredited social work education programs and doctoral programs are provided.

This study of 416 elected social workers around the country provides insight into the experiences of these elected social workers in their social work education. The classes, skills, activities, field content, and information that can prepare social workers for practice in the political arena are described. Based on these findings, suggestions for political content in social work education that can prepare social workers for this arena of practice and future research in this area are discussed.

A new instructional approach is needed so that social workers skillfully engage in policy change to address the growing economic, social, and cultural problems that affect our clients. This article presents the Practicing Policy, Pursuing Change, and Promoting Social Justice (3P) approach, which brings social work students from multiple course sections together for unified policy advocacy on a target issue. The 8 stages of the 3P approach are presented, along with a case study. Suggestions for replication and implications for social work education are discussed.

AB- This article presents findings from the first national surveys of United States and English-speaking Canadian MSW social work faculty examining their support of curriculum content on sexual orientation and gender identity. Faculty in either country are generally supportive of including LGBT content but report significantly more support for content on LGBT populations as compared to the types of oppression experienced. Significant predictors of support for LGBT content include being female, younger, non-White/non-European, having positive LGBT social attitudes, and the availability of resources on transgender-related issues. The findings suggest that faculty development should address the social attitudes among faculty as well as integrate gender identity into diversity discourse in social work education.

AB- This article describes a phenomenological study of youth mentoring in 50 Midwestern Christian congregations, with specific attention to the relevance of congregational mentoring for professional social work. Findings revealed that most mentoring relationships were congruent with goals of Christian discipleship and focused on existing congregation members. Evangelical churches were more intentional and expansive than nonevangelical Protestant and Catholic congregations in community outreach efforts, and more likely to have multiple mentoring options based on differing youth faith commitments. Discussion highlights implications of findings for social work practice with youth and families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Eighty-one individuals participated in an 8-hr seminar over 2 days that presented forgiveness from a perspective of physical, spiritual, emotional, and relational wholeness. A mixed method approach utilized the Enright Forgiveness Inventory, the State-Trait Anger Index, an analog pain scale, and intensive interviews to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. Participants reported significant improvement in their ability to forgive, along with decreased anger and pain regarding a specific forgiveness issue. Implications for research and practice are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social work faculty's attitudes contribute to creating inclusive and productive classroom climates when discussing racism, sexism, and heterosexism. Little is known about faculty's attitudes toward marginalized groups and the intersection of these attitudes with religion. This study describes social work faculty's attitudes about people of Color, women, and lesbian and gay people, and the relationship among these attitudes, religious affiliation, and religiosity. Results indicate religiosity predicts less accepting attitudes towards lesbian and gay people for Christian faculty; religious affiliation and religiosity did not predict attitudes towards women or people of Color. Intergroup dialogue is recommended for social work faculty learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This qualitative article explores how African-American elders' cultural and religious belief systems informed elders' perceptions of: (a) healthcare encounters, (b) quality of healthcare received and, (c) relationships with providers. The descriptive study involved interviews with African American elders (N = 60), 60 years of age and older. Open-ended interview questions concerned elders' perceptions of how their age, gender, race, and belief systems impacted quality of healthcare interactions. Three interrelated themes linked elders' responses: (a) desire for connectedness, (b) sense of marginality, and (c) reliance on God and cultural traditions. Findings show the value of social workers designing assessments, programs, and interventions that qualitatively explore African American elders' beliefs. A qualitative exploration can use elders' own words to show the significance of their cultural and faith traditions in all aspects of their lives.

AB- That religion has been a significant component of life in most African American communities for generations is a fact that has been firmly established in popular and scholarly literature alike. An accompanying reticence among members of this community to utilize the services of mental health professionals for serious personal/mental health issues for numerous, valid reasons has also been documented. Yet, what remains unknown is whether or not the historical reliance on the indigenous supports of the Black Church continues unabated or if the community is trending away from religious help-seeking. This paper presents initial findings from an exploratory study designed to assess the perceptions of African American Christians about help-seeking within the religious community.

AB- Spirituality is often ignored as a central component of wellness. According to Pacific cultural beliefs, spiritual harmony is necessary for wellness to emerge and is particularly salient for Pacific elders who are intergenerational connectors between the past, present, and future. Using principles of grounded theory for data collection and analysis of in-depth interviews with 10 Samoan and 10 Tongan elders in Hawai'i, two major themes emerged: meanings and expressions of spirituality and interdependence of culture, spirituality, and wellness. From a Pacific perspective, spirituality is central, and wellness does not exist without balance of the spirit, body, mind, and environment.

AB- Social workers in multicultural societies are likely to encounter clients from diverse religious backgrounds including traditions such as Buddhism. Culturally sensitive practice with such clients necessitates ongoing self-awareness of personal religious and spiritual beliefs and acknowledging personal biases. This article illustrates ways in which social workers may combine this self-awareness with knowledge of concepts from social work and religious studies to form a working knowledge of Buddhism and an understanding of the diversity within this tradition. This interdisciplinary approach, facilitated through social work education, may be used to understand the lived religious experiences of Buddhist clients in order to provide effective practice and appropriate services.

AB- Research focusing on retention of child protection employees, primarily caseworkers, indicates that high turnover rates in child welfare agencies are a consequence of high levels of stress. A qualitative study was conducted utilizing a strengths perspective to explore the reasons that 50 child welfare supervisors remain employed, specifically whether retention was related to resilience or other personal characteristics. This article is excerpted from the larger study and discusses findings that indicate the possession of a personal mission or calling, support systems, and strong coping skills are among the primary factors that contribute to retention. Additional results have been published separately. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social work has tended, in recent years toward an embrace of professionalism and of praxis founded in science and management theory. This article proposes that social work, in its narrowing emphasis on evidence-based practice and on professionalism, moves not only away from its founding traditions, but ignores the informal and unarticulated interventions of its own practitioners. The thought of Jean Vanier related to his deep religious commitment to Christianity, his vision of a caring and loving community, and his use of evocative language to articulate his vision, all contribute to a conception of helping others that challenges the limits of the rational-technical and professional model so endorsed by contemporary social work.

Research suggests many practitioners use spiritual interventions in practice, but have received little training on spirituality during their social work education. To assist practitioners enhance the effectiveness of their services, this articles discusses the process of operationalizing the evidence-based framework to inform the use of spirituality in clinical settings. Given the distinguishing role that empirical research plays in the evidence-based movement, the article focuses on the role that research can play in selecting spiritual interventions. The article concludes with a discussion of how practitioners might access relevant research on spirituality and posits that Google Scholar may be useful in this regard, particularly for practitioners unaffiliated with an academic institution.

The authors are both recent graduates of a social work doctoral program and have compiled a brief list of inter- and intra-personal tips that they believe greatly promoted their successful completion of the process and attainment of the degree. They hope these 10 simple strategies are helpful to students pursuing doctoral studies and to social work faculty who currently teach and advise graduate students to promote a successful journey through doctoral education.

AB- This study investigates the impact of the first-year program on the initial practice orientations of 2 distinct, equal-sized clusters of entering BSW students: micro-oriented and macro-oriented students. Results indicate that the proportion of students reporting a micro-practice orientation increased from 53.2% to 62.4% between the beginning and end of the year, whereas the proportion of students expressing a strong interest in macro-level practice decreased from 46.8% to 37.6%. At the end of the year, students interested in macro-level practice were also found to be interested in micro-level practice, indicating their generalist practice orientation. The findings are discussed in the light of 3 different approaches, which together provide a deeper understanding of the factors associated with students’ professional socialization.

AB- As gambling opportunities proliferate, social workers are likely to see clients with gambling-related problems, but they often lack the expertise to address these concerns. This descriptive study assessed the inclusion of content on gambling-related problems in graduate social work curricula. Responses to an online survey from 86 (43.7%) of the 197 accredited MSW programs were received. Thirty-three (38.4%) schools include gambling-related content typically taught in an addictions, mental health, or practice course. Fifty-three (61.6%) lacked such content, noting a lack of faculty expertise, low-priority content, and the lack of interest in gambling-related issues. Recommendations are offered as to how to infuse gambling identification, treatment, and policy content in social work curricula.

AB- Although a growing literature examines competencies in clinical practice, competencies of students in macro social work practice have received comparatively little attention. A grounded-theory methodology was used to elicit field instructor views of student competencies in community, organization, and policy contexts. Competencies described by field instructors encompassed 2 broad dimensions: meta competencies and procedural competencies. Meta competencies included characteristics such as self-awareness, compassion, motivation, and commitment to social justice. Procedural competencies included project management and presentation skills, and the ability to articulate and implement steps to attain goals. These identified competencies provide a basis for development of a tool to assess student performance of competencies in macro practice.

AB- Recognizing the growing need for social workers with specialized training in aging, the Hartford Partnership Program for Aging Education (HPPAE) has developed as a nationwide initiative to enhance aging education for master's-level social work students. This study presents a content analysis of answers to 2 open-ended questions in a national survey of HPPAE graduates regarding what they found most useful about the program and what they recommend for the program's improvement. Many graduates perceived value in the program's emphasis on field education, as well as its helping them to develop specialized competence in social work and aging. Graduates desired additional educational content in aging and resolution of issues in field education. Implications for specialized programs in graduate social work education are discussed.

AB- Narrative therapy, the strengths perspective, and solution-focused therapy are 3 prominent examples of social work practices heavily informed by social constructionism. Yet getting students from understanding theory to applying theory can often be challenging. This article offers a conceptual framework to aid students in the application of social constructionism and the theory of mimesis in the aforementioned 3 approaches. The “hero(ine) on a journey” is the framework offered for capturing the linguistic turn that informs postmodern practice: a focus on how narratives construct the identity of the client, how the client's efforts at reaching a preferred identity serve as the engine that drives change, and how these efforts arise from an endeavor at consciousness-raising.

AB- This article identifies factors inspiring greater political participation among undergraduate social work students (N=125). When separating students into self-identified liberals and conservatives, the study uses resource, mobilizing, and framing variables to explain greater levels of activism. After several multivariate regressions, this article concludes that political activism is spurred by many motivators. For liberals and conservatives, belonging to an activist network and maintaining activist identities were crucial to different modes of activism. Moreover, the perceived legitimacy of traditional institutions predicted protest actions of liberals and conservatives, whereas notions of collective efficacy influenced only electoral activism. Finally, demographic status mattered only for conservative students, as female and African American conservatives were less likely to protest than male and Euro American conservatives.

Orientation included the students' beliefs regarding the importance of research, the usefulness of research, and its validity. Attitude included the student's research anxiety and interest. Surveys were administered to 283 undergraduate and graduate social work students in 2008 and 2009. The Ordinary Least Squares regression found that belief in the importance of research increased the research interest of students. Belief in the usefulness of research decreased research anxiety and increased research interest. Strategies for enhancing a positive orientation and attitude toward research are proposed.

AB- The Council on Social Work Education mandates that social justice content be integrated throughout social work curricula. Although much has been written about integrating social justice into practice, policy, and human behavior and social environment courses, little attention has been given to research methods courses. This study surveyed a national sample of social work research faculty members to examine how they conceptualize and integrate social justice into their research courses. Findings show that a majority support this integration. However, they do so from general ideas of social justice. They use both traditional and creative pedagogical methods involving lectures, use of critical theories, and multimedia. Implications for social work education and future directions for research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This final article highlights the twin perils of burnout and polarization that often occur during traditional approaches to social activism, and calls attention to an alternative approach that is emerging in the field—variously referred to as “engaged spirituality,” “sacred activism,” or “spiritual activism.” Seven key themes of this new paradigm for social change are presented: spiritual motivation for justice work, recognition of interdependence, the means matter, acceptance of not knowing, openness to suffering, outer change requires inner work, and commitment to spiritual practices. The article concludes by identifying ways the articles in this special edition reflect these seven themes and specifying possible areas for future research.

AB- Given the importance of social justice advocacy within the profession and the reemergence of spirituality as an important element of social work practice, empirical research into the relationship between spirituality and social justice is needed. The purpose of the present effort is to report on a research project investigating the relationship between one form of spirituality, connectedness with humanity, and tendencies toward social justice advocacy in a group of social work students. Results of the research suggest positive relationships between this form of spirituality and commitment to social justice advocacy and willingness to take individual action to combat injustice.

AB- The abolition of slavery movement in Britain was rooted in a prophetic spirituality, an ethic of compassion and justice, and spiritual resiliency, and pioneered the development and refinement of social change tools (e.g., petitions, boycotts, etc.) and the strategic building of alliances, approaches that are now commonplace in social work practice and social movements. This article explores the spirituality of leaders in the abolition movement, and offers an overview of the tools and strategies of social change (network development, research, communications tools, and political advocacy and economic tools) employed by these leaders, highlighting their relevance for the current environmental justice movement. The article concludes with reflections on the role of spiritual resiliency in social work and the environmental movement.

AB- While concern for social justice has contributed to social work being sensitive to women’s rights, gender equity, racism, colonialism and many other forms of oppression, the profession’s embeddedness in modernity has limited its ability to move beyond an anthropocentric mindset. Consequently social injustices that accompany environmental destruction, remain at the margins of social work practices. This article examines justice issues in the context of contemporary environmental challenges and points out that environmental destruction carries distinct, often severe, social injustices to which social work should attend. Spirituality can play a vital role in drawing social and environmental injustices together enabling a truly transformative and radical practice.

AB- Social movement theory and research has paid little attention to the role of spirituality and religion in social movement mobilization. This article reviews the existing literature on the role of spirituality and religion in progressive social movements, with emphasis on movements developed in the United Sates. The analysis is framed by three strains of contemporary theorizing about social movements: the political opportunities perspective, the mobilizing structures perspective, and the cultural framing perspectives. The article also examines recent suggestions that the emotional and spiritual dimensions are left out of these three perspectives. The analysis suggests that religious institutions provide rich resources for progressive movement mobilization, and that both religious and nonreligious spirituality can provide motivation for progressive movement involvement.

AB- Recent healthcare reform legislation in the United States involved much debate and strategizing among various stakeholders. This article provides a narrative of the experience of one advocate and her organization, NETWORK, a National Catholic Social Justice Lobby. This organization, which has a particular commitment to caring for and empowering people who live at the economic margins, has been working on affordable healthcare issues for decades. Recounting both the political processes and the personal and communal spiritual journey encountered during efforts toward this landmark passage, the author highlights the role of spirituality as both motivation and resource for engaging in social justice through legislative change.

Although there is acknowledgement of the importance for spirituality in community practice, there is a paucity of research investigating how community practitioners incorporate spirituality into their work. This article explores the historical role of spirituality and community practice in the social work profession, provides an overview of the literature identifying the extent to which it addresses the integration of spirituality and social work community practice, and suggests implications for future research, practice and education.

In-depth interviews were conducted with a sample of 24 individuals. The participants included eight individuals living with advanced AIDS, twelve paraprofessional caregivers, and four family members. Data were analyzed according to the principles of grounded theory. A number of themes were identified, including positive and negative associations with God, positive and negative associations with the church, positive and negative associations with ancestral spirits, bewitchment, and existential reconciliation with HIV/AIDS. Implications for research and practice are discussed through the lens of social justice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In the experience of many clients, social justice and spirituality are intrinsically linked. After noting the growing interest in spirituality, the theoretical connection between spirituality and social justice is discussed, along with spiritually-animated efforts to create a just society at the micro-, mezzo-, and macro-levels. To illustrate how understandings of social justice are operationalized across diverse spiritual traditions, examples are profiled from Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism. The paper concludes with a discussion of the educational implications that flow from the profession’s ethical standards and the contributions that spiritually- based understandings of social justice can contribute to professional discourse; thereby enhancing the profession’s ability to address complex social problems.

AB- This article examines two social justice theories, Rawlsian Justice and the Capabilities Approach of Sen and Nussbaum, in relation to congruence with four principles of spiritually sensitive social work. We find that although Rawlsian justice has valuable insights, it has some gaps for promoting spiritually sensitive practice. In contrast, the Capabilities Approach bears more promise for promoting spiritually sensitive social work as it meets all these ethical principles. Scholars could build on its insights to articulate a vision for spiritually sensitive social justice that can guide our profession’s approaches to macropractice and social policy.

AB- Social work has had a long and complex historical relationship with religious and nonreligious spirituality across its development as a profession. The authors in this issue identify the current phase as one of "transcending boundaries," characterized by continued expansion and exploration across divides of "spiritual perspectives, academic disciplines, nations, governmental and religious institutions, and between humans and nature". This special edition addresses important issues in this new phase; specifically, the need for expansion concerning the integration of spirituality in macro social work practice. Overall, there has been an explosion of contributions to the knowledge base on spirituality and social work since the re-emergence of interest in spirituality in the eighties. The bulk of these articles focus on organizational or community based practice, with most addressing various faith-based initiatives developed in response to the Charitable Choice provision of the welfare reform legislation passed in the mid-1990s. These include descriptions of key components and processes of faith-based programming, identification of faith-based services provided to particular client populations or developed to address specific problems; and program evaluations of faith-based programs. Finally, there has been some attention to the connection between spirituality and macro social work in the areas of research and social work education.

AB- The development of standardized, valid, and reliable methods for assessment of students' practice competence continues to be a challenge for social work educators. In this study, the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), originally used in medicine to assess performance through simulated interviews, was adapted for social work to include a reflective dialogue that focused on the ability to conceptualize practice. Participants included current MSW students, recent graduates, and experienced social workers. The study demonstrated promising reliability for the method and the rating tools developed. Correlations between performance and reflection scores demonstrated that they are related, yet different, aspects of competence. The method demonstrated construct validity in that it differentiated between social workers in training and experienced workers.

AB- Recent assertions raise questions about whether university social work programs might discriminate against Christian students. Findings from this exploratory study of Christian social workers describe ways in which individuals have negotiated and/or silenced their religious identities while studying or practicing. Semistructured interviews with seven self-described Christian social workers revealed specific acts of resilience and resistance. Study participants perceived more challenges to their religious identities while in the university than the workplace. Moreover, respect for client self-determination mediated possible conflict between religious and social work values. Many participants disagreed with specific practices within the school of social work but also critically examined policies adopted by their church communities. Recommendations for pedagogy and practice are summarized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- When violence is internalized, it will manifest in various forms. Within the African American community, the African American male perpetrator's abusive behavior is one indicator of the internalized violence. African traditional practices of spirituality are a testament of their conceptualization and understanding of the intersection of mind, body, and spirit. The ways in which intimate partner violence (IPV) and spirituality intersect are critical. This article presents a conceptual framework informed by Intersectionality and Transpersonal theory to examine the intersections of IPV, gender, race, and spirituality for the African American male perpetrator in service delivery. Implications for further research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The concept of interconnectedness is rooted in both the science of ecology and the spiritual principle of the unity of life, which holds that the same “divine spark” of love is present in all life. By placing the welfare of the whole above self-interest, humans can live in harmony with the unity of life (Easwaran, 1989b). Two examples of interrelated harm to humans, animals, and the natural environment demonstrate that injury inflicted on any part of life hurts the whole. Cultural and religious maxims remind us that we experience the consequences of all our actions, and only nonviolence is consistent with the unity of life. Weil (2009) shows how to reduce our role in suffering by analyzing the web of connections surrounding social problems and making choices that do the most good and the least harm to all people, animals, and the natural environment.

AB- This article examines how specific practices within Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) assist women to develop an understanding of spirituality that promotes and sustains sobriety. AA's conceptualization of alcoholism as an illness that only a spiritual awakening can conquer seems outdated and irrelevant to many especially with the pharmacological advances that have been made in the addiction recovery field (Sanders, 2006). Using data from a qualitative exploratory study of women's experiences in AA, this paper reports that for some women in the program it is the spirituality learned and experienced through the relationship of sponsorship that has allowed them to achieve sobriety (Sanders, 2006).

Evaluation of performance in the field has proved to be a difficult task because few if any measures, including competency-based measures, have known levels of reliability and validity. Field instructors rated a sample of 154 students. Over half of the students were rated as exceptional, which may support the long-standing notion that performance ratings are Inflated. Implications for social work education and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The key components to this alternative model include providing an observation-focused, faculty-guided, 75-hour on-site experience at selected social service agencies; use of shadowing and group student learning; and the use of a tool to record observations and develop critical thinking skills. An overview of the curriculum for this pilot project is provided with examples of how both critical thinking skills and richer Integration of full generalist practice were achieved.

AB- Recent attention on community organizing in national politics provides an opportunity for social work educators to revisit and enhance community practice as a core practice of the profession. Drawing from social work's rich tradition of community practice this article provides a practical aid to understand the variety of strategies currently used by instructors and students. It proposes a framework that differentiates the underlying assumptions of three community practice paradigms—traditional, collaborative, and radical—with very different goals or visions for organizing. It examines multiple dimensions of practice within each paradigm including purpose, power, politics, and evaluation standards. In addition, it provides suggestions about how the framework can be used in the classroom. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article presents the idea that distance delivery in social work education is seen as an interaction between four constructs: the student, the setting in which the education is delivered, the educational content, and the expected educational outcomes. To fully understand these interactions, clear operational indicators, well established in construct validity, need to be identified. First, issues with the current approaches to researching distance education are described. Second, using the idea of the theory of construct validity, the four constructs are presented to facilitate a discussion about establishing operational Indicators that have potential to inform the interaction. Finally, suggestions for determining the soundness of the construct and developing multivariate models Indicative of the Interaction are described.

AB- Social workers will inevitably encounter survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault in their work. In this study we explore how education, training, and personal or professional experiences influence students' attitudes, beliefs, and behavior toward survivors. Results Indicate that education and/or training decreases students' blaming attitudes and beliefs supportive of myths and increases their screening behavior Additionally, professional experience and indirect personal experience was found to predict screening behavior, whereas direct personal experience did not show any significance. These results provide much needed information for schools to better prepare students to work with survivors of violence.

AB- This article provides an assessment of the current situation in social work education regarding the teaching of content on diversity, with a focus on implications for social work theory, practice, and education. The article provides a critical analysis of the historical development of approaches to teaching diversity content in social work education as reflected In several Iterations of CSWE's Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) since the late 1960s. In addition, the article critiques long-standing approaches to teaching this content that have been based largely on modernist theories and assimilationist assumptions about difference In the United States. It concludes with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities social work education faces today that have opened up as a result of the 2008 EPAS.

AB- New knowledge from the rapidly growing field of neuroscience has important implications for our understanding of human behavior in the social environment, yet little of this knowledge has made its way into social work education. This article presents a model for Integrating neuroscience into instruction on human development, the biopsychosocial model, psychopathology, and social work theory. Key concepts such as critical periods of brain development, neural plasticity, memory, cognition, and the impact of stress and trauma are discussed. Case studies and discussion questions are used to demonstrate the Integration of neuroscience knowledge into social work education. We argue that teaching neuroscience will enhance students' critical thinking skills and better prepare them for direct and policy practice.

AB- Limited research exists on social work students' level of depression and help-seeking beliefs. This study empirically examined the rates of depression among 215 BSW students and explored students' reasons for not using mental health services. Approximately 50% scored at or above the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale cutoff; qualitative responses identified personal reasons preventing help-seeking with themes such as "self" and "other" stigma; distrust/fear; and concerns with confidentiality, quality, and cultural competency. Denial of problems, the need for self-control/perfection, and preference for Informal help were also themes. In addition to structural reasons such as lack of time, resources, and knowledge. The implications for social work administrators, educators, and practitioners are discussed. Future research suggestions are noted.

AB- Echoing conflicts in society, some observers argue social work education should exclude religious students while others argue social work education should exclude gay students. Instead of perpetuating this conflict, I suggest educators should transcend it and affirm the voices of both religious believers and lesbians and gay men. After noting points of agreement with Dessel, Bolen, and Shepardson, I clarify some misunderstandings, respond to their arguments about new class theory and social work pedagogy, and suggest strategies to foster a learning environment that supports diversity and difference. By creating a culture that engenders respect for people with differing worldviews, perhaps we can model a new form of civil Interaction for a wider society Increasingly characterized by misunderstandings, conflict, and violence.

AB- Social work strives to be inclusive of all cultural groups and religious identities. However, a tension exists in the profession between freedom of religious expression and full acceptance of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. David Hodge and others claim social work is oppressive to evangelical Christians. This article critiques primarily Hodge's arguments using an analysis of biblical scriptures, new class theory, freedom of expression, and social work ethics. Social work and human rights principles are discussed as a guide for negotiating these issues in the social work educational environment. Intergroup dialogue is offered as a pedagogical method for addressing the tension in social work classrooms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Although Rawls is the most cited social justice theorist in social work, he is not always accurately represented in the literature. To clarify this claim, the author reviews social work scholars' views about social justice, shows social work scholars' representation of Rawls, and highlights aspects of Rawls' theory of social justice. The author's critique reveals that there have been and continue to be more differences than similarities between Rawls and social work scholars. Consequently, the article recommends revising the social work knowledge-base in relation to social justice and Rawls so that his ideas are authentically represented in future social work education and scholarship.

AB- Social workers and paraprofessionals serve psychiatric populations at high risk for suicide, but may receive little training related to suicidality. This study evaluated a suicide awareness and prevention training workshop for providers working with mentally ill homeless and previously homeless adults. Trainees attended a half day of training, and completed knowledge posttests and training evaluations. Half the trainees completed knowledge pretests, and those onsite at 21 months completed follow-up knowledge tests. Both professionals and paraprofessionals showed substantially improved knowledge at posttest and follow-up. Trainees also reported high levels of satisfaction with training format and content.

AB- Learning to write a scholarly literature review is often difficult for undergraduate students. This teaching note examines a pilot study of BSW students' use of a wiki to collaboratively write a literature review in a research course (N = 36). Students expressed negative responses toward the assignment and were reluctant to use the wiki. Their responses are explored through an examination of their activity on the wiki, discussion group feedback, comments in the course evaluation, and unsolicited remarks made by students. Common criticisms raised by students were time-management issues, group coordination concerns, and assignment parameters. Suggestions for improving and modifying the assignment are discussed.

AB- Given the importance of journal rankings to tenure, promotion, and other professional decisions, this study examines a new method for ranking social work journals. The Google Scholar h-index correlated highly with the current gold standard for measuring journal quality, Thomson Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) impact factors, but provided data for more than 4 times as many disciplinary journals. Eighty disciplinary periodicals are identified and ranked using the Google Scholar h-index. The vast majority of these were ranked higher than the lowest ranked social work journal indexed by Thomson ISI. Although the results hold salience for many professional stakeholders, they may be of particular interest to faculty who publish in disciplinary journals not indexed by Thomson ISI. The Google Scholar h-index provides faculty with an additional tool to document the quality of the venues in which they publish.

AB- Faculties across disciplines have noted an increasing number of students who are highly distressed over grades, and this distress is accompanied by pervasive demands on professors. The student behavior takes several forms, including demands for higher grades, expectations of special accommodations by faculty, and the predictions of dire outcomes for grades less than an A. This study surveyed a group of MSW students using an instrument consisting of the Academic Entitlement Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Using Latent Class Analysis, 2 distinct subgroups were identified: students with high and low self-esteem. High self-esteem students were more likely to make pervasive demands on professors. Findings suggest this behavior is a coping response to internal distress. Suggestions and implications follow. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The authors explored the use of the Practice Evaluation Knowledge Scale (PEKS) to assess student perception of acquisition and retention of practice evaluation knowledge from an undergraduate research methods class. The authors sampled 2 semesters of undergraduate social work students enrolled in an introductory research methods course. Thirty-four students completed PEKS prior to the course (T1) and at the conclusion of the course (T2). Finally, 25 students completed PEKS 2 semesters after course completion (T3). Significant differences with small to medium effect sizes were found between T1 and T2 scores and T1 and T3 scores. Findings indicate that the scale may be a useful tool in assessing perception of knowledge acquisition and retention within this population.

AB- The literature reveals scant research on self-care practices among social work students; yet self-care is vital as students prepare to be practitioners who are not only effective in working with all aspects of the clients' total selves, but who are themselves healthy. They are not prepared to be good practitioners unless they have first learned to care for themselves. This article discusses a self-care assignment that was developed by the first author for students enrolled in a Ist-year master's-level social work foundation practice class. This assignment can serve as a model for those who wish to teach students about the importance of self-care. Implications for social work education are also addressed.

AB- This pilot study (N = 63) used a mixed methods design to compare the impact of peer theater education, traditional peer education, and a comparison group on the in-depth attitudes and knowledge concerning interpersonal violence (IPV) among social work students in an introductory social work course. Six focus groups were conducted with students to assess their attitudes and thoughts about IPV prior to the intervention and 2 months after the intervention. The results indicate greater knowledge and healthier attitudes toward IPV for both the peer education and peer theater groups, with little change in the comparison group. Participants in the peer theater group, however, communicated a better ability to integrate their knowledge with real-life situations and practically apply this knowledge.

AB- Developing student competencies related to evidence-based practice (EBP) is becoming increasingly important as an evidence-based approach to practice becomes more salient in the field. Although there has been significant discussion in the literature about how to teach EBP at the master's level, there is far less discussion about such instruction in baccalaureate programs. This article describes an undergraduate senior capstone project, which, in partnership with internship activities, developed students' familiarity with EBP concepts and improved their abilities to search for and use interventions from the professional literature. Findings from a survey study of the project indicated that students felt better prepared to use best practices and that the project enhanced their overall sense of competence as practitioners.

AB- Although the new Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) represent a shift from measuring learning outcomes to core competencies, results from assessments conducted prior to this shift continue to provide useful information for program-level assessment and can serve as a baseline as programs redesign assessments for reaffirmation. This paper describes a MSW program's systematic assessment of educational outcomes as well as the process to redesign this plan to meet current EPAS. Administrative structure, conceptual modeling, design, instrumentation, data gathering, and use of results for affirmation and improvement are highlighted. Logistic feasibility and sound methodology in implementing the redesigning of protocol among various constituents (students, field instructors, alumni) are considered. Discussion about continued use of this structure using current EPAS is included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study presents pilot data using an instrument called the Implicit Factors Survey (IFS) that is designed to measure factors within the implicit curriculum, or the educational environment in which the explicit curriculum is delivered. The implicit factors explored included community, diversity, faculty advising, and support services. Also included in the IFS were field and academic experiences. Sixty-four graduating MSW students completed the survey, and descriptive data and qualitative data were collected for each of the measured areas. Several important findings emerged from the data, including the variability in the quality of classroom instruction that students received and the comfort level that students felt in expressing their political or religious views. Implications for social work education and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Findings from this exploratory study identify personal attributes that are significant in enabling MSW students and social work employees to succeed. Social work educators and agency administrators generally agree that personal attributes such as ethical behavior, honesty, and respectfulness are more important than cognitive traits such as numeric skills and academic record. A discussion addresses implications for MSW admissions and curriculum as well as agency policy and practices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Edicts within the Council on Social Work Education's 2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards address the importance of understanding the intersection of personal and professional values. Twenty MSW students, chosen on the basis of diverse cultural and personal characteristics, were interviewed about their motivations for pursuing a MSW degree and their personal and professional values. Thematic analysis yielded an emergent model relating the intersection of multiple forms of motivation, encountering and resolving value conflicts, and integrating personal and professional identities. Implications for education and practice are (1) the intersection of personal and professional identities should be explicit components of curriculum; (2) strategies for managing value conflicts should be an integral part of the curriculum; and (3) the relationship between identity integration and practice needs to be delineated.

AB- This article explores the difference between ethnic identity scores for African descended MSW students who are native to this country, who are first generation born of immigrant parents, and who are foreign-born Black immigrants. The research further explores whether ethnic identity is associated with the students' commitment to work with their own ethnic groups. Results indicate that all three groups of students demonstrate high ethnic identity, and variability in group means was not statistically significant. However, statistically significant difference existed among the 3 groups on 1 of the measures of propensity for practice. Also determined was a significant relationship between ethnic identity and the propensity for practice items. Implications for social work education and additional research are highlighted.

AB- Deliberation that upholds the social work values of justice and inclusion is an essential component of the policy-making process; yet most social welfare policy curricula focus instead on the goals of distributive justice. This article presents a model that demonstrates how deliberative justice can be easily incorporated into beginning level social welfare policy classes. Feedback from social work students indicates their understanding of the concepts of deliberative justice presented in a policy class and their appreciation of a class role-play designed to illustrate the implementation of related theory. Social work practitioners at the policy level may also find this model useful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The study aims to examine the relationship between spirituality and religiosity, and depressive symptoms among 111 individuals undergoing inpatient substance-abuse treatment. Findings indicated that both dimensions of spirituality, the existential aspect and the relationship with God aspect, were significant predictors of depressive symptoms. The existential dimension of spirituality was inversely related to depressive symptoms, and the relatedness to God was positively related to depressive symptoms. Alternative theoretical explanations based on attachment theory are presented to interpret the unexpected positive relationship between individuals’ perceived relationship with God and depressive symptoms. Gender was also a significant predictor of depressive symptoms, whereby females were more likely to report higher depressive symptomatology than males. It is important that mental health professionals consider the implementation of spiritually based interventions to address depressive symptomatology in the field of addiction.

AB- This article discusses therapists’ perspectives of how they use the concepts of spirituality and kinship with clients in a therapy setting. Data were gathered from a larger phenomenological study that focused on African American therapists’ perspectives of the use of strengths with African American families. Thirty licensed African American therapists from the fields of marriage and family therapy, social work, psychology, and licensed professional counselors, who self-identified as utilizing strengths during therapy with African American families, served as participants. In this study, we explored whether therapists identified two of the five major strengths of African American families that were originally cited by Robert Hill (1971, 1999) as contributors to effective family functioning. The strengths of spirituality and kinship or extended family consistently emerged and were explored as themes that were effective in bringing about family functioning and successful therapy outcomes.

AB- Utilizing a national random sample of 225 members of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), this study examined practitioners’ personal spiritual beliefs, their attitudes regarding the role of religion and spirituality in social work, and factors that might predict practitioners’ use of religious and spiritual interventions. Findings suggest religion and spirituality plays an important role in respondents’ personal and professional lives. A multiple regression analysis indicates that older respondents, with a stronger positive attitude regarding the role of religion and spirituality in social work practice were more likely to utilize spiritual practices or interventions.

We illustrate the process, goals, and tasks of the Community Assessment Project, which incorporates community-level assessment, collection and analysis of public data, and social policy analysis and planning. Students in three master's classes (Social Work Research I, Ending Poverty: Models for Social Change and Social Action, and Advanced Social Policy in Aging) worked in self-directed groups to explore the impact of economic insecurity on our most vulnerable clients. The project engaged students, linked research and policy practice, and helped to educate the next generation of social workers about urban poverty and strategies for community-based research and practice.

AB- Using a sample of 124 incoming social work graduate students, we examined whether levels of perceived incongruence with social work values and the perceived culture of a graduate social work program significantly correlate with social psychological constructs. The social psychological constructs are associated with maintenance and support for social stratification in general and with prejudicial attitudes based on sexual orientation more specifically. Results suggest that higher levels of cultural incongruence are associated with significantly higher levels of right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, hostile heterosexism, aversive heterosexism, and paternalistic heterosexism. Nonsignificant results emerged for amnestic heterosexism and positive stereotypic heterosexism. Implications for social work education and future research are discussed.

AB- Social work education research frequently has suggested an interaction between teaching techniques and learning environments. However, this interaction has never been tested. This study compared virtual and face-to-face learning environments and included active listening concepts to test whether the effectiveness of learning environments depends on teaching techniques. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two learning environments (virtual, face-to-face) and two teaching techniques (experiential, lecture plus discussion) on satisfaction, perception of learning gains, and learning of listening skills. Findings support that both virtual and face-to-face experiential learning are teaching techniques that can develop listening skills, but the interaction was the opposite of that originally predicted. Face-to-face learning environments provided better results than virtual learning environments only when experiential learning techniques were used.

AB- The specifics of how research competencies should be taught in social work curricula vary. This study explored requirements for student research projects and program director attitudes toward research education using the responses from 201 BSW and MSW programs to a 48-item survey. A majority of the respondents' programs require students to undertake research, and a majority reported an overall positive attitude toward such projects. Variation was found in perceived barriers to research between programs that do and do not require student research projects as well as differences between BSW and MSW programs in student development of research topics and presentations at conferences. Hands-on teaching methods, faculty support, and an emerging research continuum across social work education are discussed.

Each program represents a differing approach to teaching ethics: (a) infusion of ethics content, (b) a required discrete course emphasizing what the authors term a mixed-model approach, and (c) a required discrete ethics course emphasizing a common morality model. It was hypothesized that students taking a discrete course in ethics would demonstrate greater gains in the areas of moral judgment and ethical sensitivity. It was also hypothesized that students taking a discrete course emphasizing the common morality model would demonstrate even greater gains. Findings and implications for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Although many crime victims seek support from members of the faith community, faith leaders may feel unsure of their abilities to assist. This paper describes findings from a descriptive needs assessment that preceded a national project to link faith-based organizations and victim service programs in five high-crime neighborhoods. Approximately 90 participants were interviewed, including faith leaders, victim service providers, and other professionals. A majority saw positive implications of faith-secular collaboration but also identified concerns. Findings focus on perceived obstacles and facilitators of collaboration, addressing climate for faith-secular collaboration, disciplinary differences, community engagement, and church-state separation. Implications for collaboration are explored and recommendations are provided for future efforts to link faith communities and secular services.

AB- This study examined the relationship between religion and drug dependency of Malay Muslim youth. A comparison between addicts and nonaddicts were conducted. The comparison was conducted to study the degree of their religiosity, and the effect of that religiosity on their drug behavior. Other factors such as parental relationship, peer influence and personal attitudes were also looked at. The findings showed an overwhelming percentage of the addicts were ignorant to the teachings of their religion, and they took religion lightly. The addicts scored low on the religiosity scales, while the opposite was true for the nonaddicts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The focus of this policy article is not on the merit of faith-based initiative but on who serves the poor. The key argument is that in the United States, especially through its federal government, has increasingly abdicated “safety net” services of helping poor cope with the hardship of poverty. As we document, as a collective, Americans pay low taxes and turn away from using taxes to help poor people. Furthermore, the American government no longer financially supports the poor but rather provide them with work-incentive-based services. While the general public and their politicians have turned away from the poor, year in and year out faith-based communities and their congregations and organizations care for and actively serve those with the least resources. Thus, it is our position that the current administration needs the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, but this office needs to adopt new approaches that are more community oriented.

AB- The present study is an exploratory investigation into an area of study that to date has received very little attention: the relationship between childhood emotional neglect and adult spirituality. Participants were surveyed regarding childhood emotional neglect and their spirituality. Spirituality was defined as involving four areas of connectedness: with a higher power, with others, with humanity, and with an inner core. The study hypothesized a predictive relationship between emotional neglect and connectivity and that degree of connectedness would be inversely associated with severity of neglect. Results indicate an inverse, statistically significant, yet weak predictive relationship between neglect and several types of connectivity.

AB- This article outlines challenges and opportunities educators and students face while attempting to develop a global perspective in social work. It discusses the need for more international focus in the classroom and increased field placements in non-Western countries. Exercises using an in-depth case study of the historic and current dynamics of Cyprus are proposed. After centuries of strife, Cyprus remains divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. This case provides social work educators with classroom material lending itself to both student self-reflection and a greater understanding of imperialism, colonization, and marginalization by Western nations and how those elements affect student ideologies. Particular attention is paid to the need for culturally informed and self-reflective international approaches to child welfare.

AB- The Council on Social Work Education's Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) stresses the importance of the implicit curriculum in shaping a school's culture. This timely article describes how the implicit BSW curriculum was developed at a large Southern state university using three Web-based projects: (1) a glossary of terms for students, (2) frequently asked questions (FAQs) for advisors, and (3) a list of FAQs about field problems and resources for students and field instructors. It presents the 5-step process used in its development and discusses educational implications. The article fills a distinct void in the social work literature about this important accreditation topic. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The current study examined mental health symptomology, substance use, and adaptive coping among 416 social work students following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Among participants, 47% scored at or above the clinical level for depression, with 6% of students showing clinical PTSD-like symptoms, and 16.9% reporting substance use. Two thirds (66.9%) employed 8 of the 10 adaptive coping responses. Negative cognitive and emotional reactions to the hurricanes correlated positively with mental health symptomology and 7 of the 10 adaptive coping responses. In the aftermath of a natural disaster, it is critical to provide students with education, information, and close supervision to address issues around impairment and vulnerability and to maximize resilience.

AB- This study uses a work stress theoretical framework to examine the effects of direct and indirect client violence on a randomly selected national sample of MSW and BSW social work students from the National Association of Social Workers (N = 595). Client violence variables were analyzed in relationship to fear of future violence and occupational commitment. When students experienced every type of client violence except direct physical assault, they had significantly increased fears of future client violence. Students with increased fear of future violence had significantly increased normative and continuance occupational commitment. Students had exceptionally high affective occupational commitment, regardless of experiences with client violence. Implications for social work programs, field agencies, field educators, and social work students are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Over the past 2 decades the topic of spirituality and its relationship to the social work profession has taken its place as a significant and important part of the agenda for social work research, education, and practice. In this article we discuss the results of a qualitative study that addresses how a group of social work practitioners defined spirituality and the implications of these findings specifically for social work education. Based on findings from a thematic analysis of interviews with 20 social workers, we explore the usefulness of the term spirituality in social work education and the importance of student engagement in a self-awareness process related to spirituality. A template to initiate discussion of these issues for use in the classroom is proposed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article elaborates mimesis as a theory of causality used to explain human behavior. Drawing parallels to social constructionism's critique of positivism and naturalism, mimesis is offered as a theory of causality explaining human behavior that contests the current dominance of Newton's theory of causality as cause and effect. The contestation of Newton's theory takes place within the specific dimension of explaining human behavior. Working complementarily with social constructionism, mimesis is offered as a broad fundamental theory defining the postmodern discourse as it relates to the human sciences. As such, it provides a vital link in connecting various postmodern theories of language (e.g., Foucault's technology of power) to explaining human behavior and, hence, aiding postmodern social work practice.

It finds congruence in selected organizational arrangements that are pervasive and routine, and disparities with respect to expectations about public student performance, peer accountability, the view of adaptive anxiety, and accountable talk. This article asserts that practicum effectiveness could be enhanced by a broader application of Shulman's criteria through a greater emphasis on group structures for learning/teaching in the field.

AB- As the population ages and greater numbers of older adults enter the guardianship system, outcome measures are needed that capture the dimensions of quality of life that are relevant for this population. To explore definitions of quality of life, focus groups were conducted with elder law attorneys and guardians (N = 21). Based on prior research, participants were asked about spirituality as it pertains to quality of life. Analysis yielded seven themes. Participants identified choice as central to quality of life. Choice allowed incapacitated older adults to engage in relationships and activities that are important to them and thereby increase hope, purpose, and meaning in life.

AB- Previous investigators have confirmed that loneliness is related to depression in late life. In this study we examined the potential buffering effects that spirituality might have on loneliness and depression among 40 older persons who lived alone and were homebound. The relationship between loneliness and depression was statistically significant, but the moderating effect of spirituality on this relationship was not statistically significant. We noted patterns based on an analysis of covariance that spirituality might potentially mitigate the effect of loneliness on depression under some circumstances. The findings suggest that spiritual resources might buffer the adverse effects of depression and loneliness among the current cohort of homebound older adults and might improve these older persons' mental health and quality of life.

AB- Spirituality and religion have become important topics in social work practice, especially in work with the terminally ill and the elderly. Understanding the impact of religion on formal service use gives insight to the significance of spirituality and religion in developing and delivering services to elderly persons. This study was to use the survey data conducted in a naturally occurring retirement community (NORC). The results indicate that attending religious services has an important negative relationship with formal service use after controlling all demographic and social factors. This study contributes to the growing research literature on older adults service use and deepens the perception of religion and attending religion services on the issue of spirituality and aging.

AB- Cognitive behavioral therapy is an effective method for treating many older adults with depression. Efficacy may be enhanced for some clients, however, by modifying cognitive behavioral therapy with beliefs and values drawn from clients' spiritual narratives. Potential enhancements include faster recovery, improved treatment adherence, lower posttreatment relapse, and reduced treatment disparities. In light of the lack of training many gerontological social workers have received on spirituality, this paper orients readers to spiritually modified cognitive behavioral therapy. Toward this end, the research on this modality is reviewed, rationales for its suitability with older adults are provided, the process of constructing spiritually modified cognitive behavioral therapy self-statements with older adults wrestling with depression is illustrated, and ethical guidelines are discussed.

AB- This Field Note presents a follow-up to a pilot study that explored pre-field placement anxiety for 1st-year MSW students. Previous studies report that students experience significant anxiety as they anticipate their field placement, and research indicates that anxiety has the potential to affect learning. A sample of 204 students reported moderate levels of anxiety, comparable to previous findings. Older students, and those with prior work and classroom experience, reported significantly less anxiety. Students described specific concerns but also viewed anxiety as an expectable response with positive connotations for enhanced learning. Implications for social work education and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

This unique model involved active collaboration among social work and journalism graduate students and faculty to create a single-issue magazine focused on a diverse range of social welfare issues. After describing the development and format of the model as well as requisite resources, the authors discuss emergent learning opportunities for both groups of students, including identification of role tensions between the 2 professions, deepened understanding of the social work profession and its associated roles, and methods for collaboration to advance the social justice purposes of both professions.

AB- Social work education has not yet formulated an explicit educational framework that combines diversity and oppression, but academicians are examining new approaches (Van Soest, Canon, & Grant, 2000). This article presents a conceptual framework for culturally relevant practice that integrates a human diversity and social justice focus within the context of our program's Human Behavior and Social Environment, or HBSE, courses. We believe this framework effectively synthesizes the ideas of scholars who have preceded us in a manner that consistently supports students as it challenges them to actively engage with topics that can initially make them feel uncomfortable. The overall purpose of our framework is to teach students how to work for social justice goals using a continuum of phased actions.

The home environment affects the intervention process at each stage of contact with a family. Home-based practice requires specific skills to deal with clients' presenting concerns as well as safety, boundary, confidentiality, and ethical challenges. This article offers practical tips for integrating content regarding home-based social work into courses throughout the curriculum to better prepare social work students for home-based practice. It discusses how home-based content in both master's and baccalaureate courses supports current Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards requirements.

AB- The integration of spirituality content into curricula has accelerated dramatically during the past decade. Despite this trend, little discussion has appeared in the literature about the instructional methods best suited to teach spirituality. Adopting a new approach referred to as pedagogical pluralism, the authors suggest that some aspects of spirituality content are best taught using pedagogical strategies drawn from modernism, whereas other aspects are most congruent with postmodern strategies. Indeed, the authors propose that the epistemological assumptions that inform postmodernism and common understandings of spirituality are highly congruent. Consequently, significant components of spirituality content may be best taught using nontraditional postmodern pedagogical strategies that may strike some readers as controversial, or even radical.

AB- This study examined how qualitative research is taught in foundation MSW courses using a content analysis of syllabi and a survey. The Council on Social Work Education required qualitative research content in 1994 and several authors advocate for greater inclusion of it. Yet no research about what qualitative content is included on syllabi is presently available. All accredited MSW programs were contacted, yielding 57 surveys and 48 syllabi. Wide variation in the numbers of course sessions, focal content, readings, and assignments was found nationally. Qualitative content was absent in 8% of syllabi, and only a single class session was the modal level of inclusion. Few syllabi included named qualitative research approaches. Further, very few assignments addressed qualitative research content. Recommendations for curriculum development are offered.

AB- The Council on the Role and Status of Women in Social Work Education (WC), a volunteer committee of the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), has a 37-year history. This article presents an overview of the WC from the late 1960s to September 2006 and acknowledges the needs, status, and contributions of women in social work education. Drawing on primary and secondary data sources, the authors articulate two central themes: (1) organizational development of the WC, and (2) contributions of the WC to social work education and practice. The mission and work of the WC remain relevant today, because there is still a need to monitor and advocate for equity for women in social work education.

AB- This invited study sought to determine the current status of women in social work education for the special section of the Journal of Social Work Education. Analysis of the latest data available indicate that gender differences remain pervasive across many aspects of social work education, including pay, rank, job duties, and tenure. Women appear disadvantaged in almost all areas analyzed when compared to men. Additionally, pilot study data collected in Canada suggest that women academics are similarly disadvantaged. The article concludes with a discussion of the limitations of available data, broader contextual issues for women in social work, and suggestions for implementing change.

AB- Barbara Wootton, a prominent British social scientist and educator of social workers, examined the status of social work in the 1950s. Wootton argued iconoclastically that the social work literature presented a profession that was arrogant and far removed from the common concerns of the populations served. In addition, Wootton felt that the social worker-client relationship was emphasized to the extent that other important aspects of social work were gravely overlooked. As a lifelong socialist, Wootton stressed the need for an interdisciplinary approach to the solution of human problems and for people— professionals and clients alike—to bridge the gap between social classes. The continuing relevance of Wootton's writings to current social work is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- There is a scarcity of knowledge on the mentoring experiences of Black women in social work academia. Using a survey methodology, this pilot study examines the mentoring experiences of 10 Black, female leaders in social work education as protégées. It also examines how they describe their current mentoring behavior toward recent protégés. The results indicate participants provide more psychosocial and career mentoring than they received as doctoral students or as faculty members. Additionally, participants received the least help from their own mentors in balancing career and family and currently give little assistance of this kind to their own protégés.

AB- A path model predicting students' satisfaction with their field placement was tested on 144 MSW students at a northeastern university. The results showed that supervision was related to satisfaction both directly and indirectly through its influence on efficacy in the field and strain. Amount of preparation for the field affected satisfaction only indirectly by its relationship to higher efficacy. There was no indication that supervision buffered the presumed negative effect of poor preparation on dissatisfaction, strain, or efficacy. Limitations imposed by the cross-sectional design and single-school sample are considered, and recommendations are made to continue attempts to enhance field supervision and increase student preparation. Particular emphasis is given to implementing procedures that address the mediating roles of student strain and efficacy.

AB- Spiritual abuse and neglect of youth are experiences or environments that detrimentally affect the development of meaning, purpose, connection/belonging, faith, or moral and ethical guidelines. This national study expands our knowledge about the abuse and neglect of children and adolescents in the spiritual domain by examining the frequency in which social workers’ encountered ten forms of this type of maltreatment. Findings reveal that maltreatment of this nature may be occurring often enough to be an issue that needs to be explored and addressed. Implications for practitioners, program developers, child advocates, and the need for further research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Intimate partner violence is a prevalent yet highly underreported issue in the United States. Religious leaders are in a key position to help victims, particularly those who will not disclose the abuse to secular professionals such as police officers, doctors, and social workers. Church leaders tend to have close and trusting relationships, access to families’ homes, are familiar with families’ histories, and many times are the support to which victims turn. This study examines nine protestant pastors’ perceptions of and responses to intimate partner violence as an exploratory study. Data were collected and analyzed through semistructured interviews and Strauss and Corbin’s Grounded Theory. The findings illustrated that the majority of pastors perceive intimate partner violence as occurring to middle-aged women and being physical, emotional, and verbal in nature. The pastors reported that they assess, refer, and counsel the victims (and sometimes the couple together) and support divorce if necessary. The participants’ avoidance toward intimate partner violence issues among their congregants were connected to their lack of training and access to resources. Implications for merging victim empowering counseling and pastoral counseling are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- A review of the literature revealed that few domestic violence programs include ongoing social support or a focus on the spiritual concerns of domestic violence survivor. The literature appears to support the development of this spirituality and support group theory and confirms the importance of caring communities for domestic violence survivors and thrivers. The focus of this article is to propose a model of spirituality and social support for domestic violence survivors and thrivers. A synthesis of the Rite of Passage framework in combination with the Dance of the Spirit spiritual growth theory of Maria Harris is presented. An outline of a seven week spirituality group for those who have left the domestic violence situation is presented and implications for practice are discussed.

AB- Using a sample of 102 Korean church goers, this study found that a higher level of general religiosity was significantly associated with a lower level of depression only for non-visa-holding church members (U.S. citizens). The results underscore the importance of considering both the type of religiosity/spirituality assessed and sample characteristics when examining the religiosity–mental health relationship since both the dimension of religiosity measured and the visa status of the respondents qualified the relationship. A test of the mediating role of social support was not significant. Recommendations were made to explore mechanisms for the religiosity-depression relationship other than social support.

Educators must challenge years of socialization and internalized ideologies of superiority that make hierarchies of privilege appear to be the natural order. In the interests of expanding and strengthening social work educators' repertoire of instructional tools on the topic of institutional oppression, we review the relevant literature on institutional oppression and game-based learning and offer readers an original game-based learning exercise adapted from the popular family game Jenga as a tool for instructing on the topic of institutional oppression.

AB- This article presents an approach to human behavior curriculum that requires students to achieve the purpose outlined in the Council on Social Work Education's 2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards to "distinguish, appraise, and integrate multiple sources of knowledge, including research-based knowledge." It emphasizes and allows for critical thinking about knowledge relevant to trauma, resilience, and survivorship, providing empirically based information to support risk and resilience theory in an ecological, life course perspective. Information from a study of Nazi Holocaust survivors is used to illustrate how personal development, family functioning, and community support occur under the most severe stress.

AB- Student-directed projects are increasingly becoming a common phenomenon in schools of social work across the United States. Students acquire a great learning experience from these projects, which sharpen their skills in leadership, innovation, and practice. Social work practitioners who go through such a process emerge having acquired knowledge beyond what is offered in the classroom. In this article we present a case study of 5 African graduate students who engaged in innovative efforts to implement a social development intervention in Uganda. The discussion includes ways to support students who embark on student-directed projects in schools of social work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Developing competency in diversity and assessment are key educational priorities. With Native American clients a spiritual assessment is typically required because spirituality is often instrumental to health and wellness in Native cultures. In keeping with the movement toward competency-based education, this qualitative study sought to answer the question: How can future social workers conduct spiritual assessments with Native American clients in an effective, culturally competent manner? Analysis yielded a number of practice-oriented insights that can be grouped into 4 categories: the importance of spiritual assessment, preassessment considerations, the process of conducting the assessment, and areas of potential value conflict. The implications of the results are discussed as they intersect social work education and practice courses in particular.

AB- Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex social problem that social workers must be trained to address, using the best available evidence. In this article we review divergent theories, research findings, and methods that underpin debates about the role of gender in IPV perpetration and victimization. We examine the literature that contextualizes IPV and identifies different types of IPV and recommend training social workers to use differential assessment tools for IPV. We conclude that gender does matter in IPV and that social work students can critically evaluate the gender debates in selecting evidence for safe and effective practice.

Significant and interrelated themes emerged including the subjective and unique definitions of emotionally charged events; the considerable effect of the student-field instructor relationship and the organizational environment, whereby both act as major risk and major protective factors; and participants seeking help from sources in their family and social networks and not necessarily from those in formal social work education roles.

AB- The philosophical basis for the federal human subject protection policy is congruent with the values of the social work profession. The pragmatics are more complicated. The purpose of this study was to explore the attitudes toward, knowledge about, and practices of institutional review boards (IRBs) across colleges and universities as reported by social work program directors. Differences were found in program directors' reports of the time required for the initial review of submissions, the types of research considered exempt institutionally, and respondents' knowledge of IRBs. These findings provide support for the Council on Social Work Education's recommendation for increased involvement of social work educators in IRBs and related policies.

AB- Rapidly changing demographics in the United States, the 2008 Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards, and recent developments in the literature that question the effectiveness of multiculturalism and cultural competence suggest social work education, research, and practice are in need of a new approach to diversity. In conceptualizing diversity, social workers need to address a broad social context that includes institutional/structural arrangements, recognize the intersection of multiple identities, and integrate an explicit social justice orientation. This article presents critical race theory as a paradigmatic framework that focuses on both institutions and the pain they create for marginalized people. The critique is multidimensional, addressing root causes and personal distress while pursuing transformational change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Religious congregations are involved in restoring those ties in refugee resettlement in various ways. This study was undertaken to identify the prevalence and types of services congregations provide to refugees in a metropolitan area. Data from 1,392 congregations from the Philadelphia Census of Congregations were analyzed to provide detailed information of congregations involved in refugee resettlement. Characteristics of 129 congregations who provided programming for refugees and in-depth descriptions of 18 congregational programs are presented.

AB- This exploratory study investigated the importance of spiritual and religious belief among university students (N = 204) and the associated predictor variables. Most respondents agreed that spiritual/religious values were important, and they relied on these values to problem solve and cope. These respondents generally believed that spirituality/religion would allow them to overcome health and psychological challenges and that spiritual/religious beliefs were more important than financial indicators of success. Most did not believe that external signs of religious observance were odd. Most respondents were likely to view religious/spiritual behaviors as an attempt to commune with a supreme being rather than as a nonpersonal relationship with a cosmic power or a search for enlightenment. In a regression model using the predicted variable of The Importance of Religious/Spiritual Beliefs in My Life (Adjusted R² = .799), there were seven significant predictor variables: (a) Frequency of Prayer/Meditation, (b) Overcoming Problems and Maintaining Health with Spirituality/Religion, (c) Important Aspects of Living, (d) Accommodating Religious/Spiritual Values into One's Life, (e) Communing with a Supreme Being, (f) Attendance at Religious/Spiritual Services, and (g) External Signs of Religious Observance. The predictor variable of Religion and Spirituality in the Age of Science (p = .054) was retained in the final model because of its proximity to significance and to minimize the risk of committing a type II error. Implications of these findings are discussed for human service educators. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Many individuals in African-American communities turn to their pastors for help with domestic violence; however, very little is known about actual clergy perspectives and practices regarding intimate partner violence. A single-interview template was designed to gain insight into the thinking of eight clergy on this topic. The findings of this study provide insight regarding perspectives and practices used by clergy to address partner violence, many of which are compatible with clinical best practices. They also provide understanding about the attitudes or interventions possibly encountered by victims of intimate partner violence in some churches.

AB- This descriptive, exploratory study is part of a larger observational study of the quality of cancer care delivered to population-based cohorts of newly diagnosed patients with lung and colorectal cancer. The current study explores the role of spiritual well-being in adjustment to life after the cancer diagnosis, utilizing the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being-Expanded (FACIT-Sp-Ex) Scale. Survey data collected from 304 newly diagnosed cancer survivors were analyzed to explore important aspects of spirituality, such as sense of meaning in one's life, harmony, peacefulness, and a sense of strength and comfort from one's faith. Spiritual well-being scores, particularly meaning/peace, were statistically significant for African Americans, women, and colorectal cancer survivors. These findings amplify a need for oncology social workers and other practitioners to assess spiritual well-being in cancer survivors in an effort to strengthen psychosocial treatment plans. Implications for social work practice and research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study explores spirituality in relation to quality of life for Chinese people with severe mental illness whose spiritual orientations are either similar to or different from Western traditions. 117 Chinese people with severe mental illness who were involved in community-based supportive services in Hong Kong completed self-administered questionnaires on spirituality and quality of life. Spirituality was found positively related to individual's quality of life. In particular, three elements of spirituality, tranquility, resistance to disorientation, and resilience were positively related to the domains of quality of life.

AB- The practice of social work has changed significantly over the years, but models for student field learning have changed relatively little. This article describes two recent changes implemented by the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago that are intended to connect the contemporary demands of generalist social work more closely to the preparation of students in field education. These are (1) collective learning, to broaden students' understanding of settings and populations; and (2) macro projects, which are intended to expand students' understanding of assessment and intervention at multiple system levels within an agency.

However, sustaining international students in their field placements can be especially challenging for programs in nonurban settings. This article begins a discussion of what might enhance such students' field internships by reporting the experiences of the authors and some of their colleagues, examining the literature, and assessing survey responses from a small sample of field coordinators.

AB- Social work education has long struggled to acknowledge cultural diversity and identify teaching methods to prepare students to work effectively with diverse populations. This article describes an educational technique designed to teach students how to recognize racism and social injustice—in this instance, by examining an educational case study located in a multicultural human services agency in Chiapas, Mexico. One session of a multicultural social work course was devoted to a role-play based on a real incident that had occurred in this agency. Student feedback and the authors' observations address the usefulness of this educational intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The present study examines the genesis of emotional exhaustion among undergraduate social work students in Hong Kong. Of particular concern are the relationships among key factors, including the student's idealism, altruism and career orientation, and emotional exhaustion. To investigate this, the study employed survey data collected from 165 undergraduate social work students recruited from a major university in Hong Kong. The results support the hypothesis that idealism and career orientation affect students' emotional exhaustion. Nonetheless, the results do not support the hypothesized negative relationship between altruism and emotional exhaustion. The implications of the findings for further research and prevention of emotional exhaustion in social work education are discussed.

This article presents the evaluation of a mentoring program for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in social work education. Forty-three mentors and protégés responded to a survey regarding their program experiences. The results highlight the need for targeted mentoring, although some disparities of experience for mentors and protégés in this program are apparent. In general, mentors felt positive about participating, giving back to the LGBT community, and were more satisfied with their experiences than were the protégés, who were looking for more specific types of instrumental and psychosocial support.

AB- During the past 3 decades dozens of studies have ranked schools of social work using faculty productivity or program reputation to gauge program quality. These studies are often controversial because they rely on only a few dimensions of schools' performance. This study used publicly available admissions data from the past 15 years to examine how selective schools are in admitting full-time MSW and PhD students. The findings demonstrate that selectivity varies greatly among schools, and that rankings by productivity or reputation are somewhat different from rankings by selectivity. Trends in admissions and contextual reasons for wide variation among programs are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Data were collected from 188 field supervisors who provided usable questionnaires, representing a response rate of 74%. Construct validation by exploratory factor analysis identified a 5-factor solution to measure suitability that accounted for 52.1% of variance: Overall, Analytical, Practice, Personal, and Ethical Suitability. This solution has achieved modest construct validity with communalities ranging between .753 and .376 (α = .93). Potential use of the scale and suggestions for future study are discussed.

AB- Although the importance of metaphors is described in the social work literature, few articles or books in the profession have considered the role of metaphors in social policy, especially in providing a negative frame within which marginalized groups can be considered. This negative framing naturally supports aversive social policies designed to control the behaviors or opportunities of such groups. This article describes both the importance of metaphors within the political arena and the role of dehumanizing metaphors in fostering a receptive environment for these aversive policies. Policy practice that includes advocating for vulnerable community groups requires the ability to analyze and shed the light of reason on these metaphors.

AB- The purpose of this study was to explore field instructors' experiences and insights in working with lesbian and gay MSW students. In-depth 1- to 1.5-hour interviews were conducted with 8 field instructors selected using purposive sampling. Data were analyzed using narrative thematic analysis and a constant comparative method. One set of themes emerged across all informants; a second set emerged exclusively from lesbian- and gay-identified informants. Dynamic interactions among the student, the field instructor-student relationship, and the agency context suggest the importance of moving beyond individual-level conceptualizations to address sexual orientation-related barriers and opportunities in field education.

AB- Substance abuse has been identified as a significant social problem. Social work is uniquely positioned to affect this problem. Kennesaw State University has established a substance abuse concentration as part of its master's of social work program. The purpose of this article is to describe the development of this curriculum. The curriculum is based on a biopsychosocial view of human functioning and consists of 6 advanced courses: 2 practice, 2 behavior, 1 policy, and 1 seminar. Because of its proximity to the consequences, its ability to work at multiple societal levels, and its value base, it is imperative that the social work profession continues to embrace and enhance its role as a leader in treating and researching substance abuse issues.

AB- A variety of pedagogical techniques have shown promising results in promoting acceptance and affirmation of gays and lesbians among students in social work, allied health, and education professions. In this article we examine whether 211 students enrolled in a human sexuality course in a southeastern university changed their attitudes toward gays and lesbians and identify differences in attitudes by demographic groups. At pretest the sample scored moderately negative on the Index of Attitudes Toward Homosexuality. Scores were significantly lower at posttest. Males scored significantly higher than females at pretest, but their scores changed more at posttest. Human sexuality courses that incorporate an exposure component are one way social work educators can change negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians.

AB- Social work doctoral education is essential to the continuation of the profession through its production of educators and researchers. Predicted shortages of educators give urgency to the problems of dissertation delays, lengthy time to completion, and attrition. Using Vygotsky's sociocultural theory of learning, in this article we review the literature on barriers and facilitating factors to dissertation completion. Findings support the relevance of postulated mechanisms of learning such as scaffolding and interaction with more knowledgeable others. Findings also suggest that interventions are necessary at individual, relational, and institutional/departmental levels, and that individual success is contingent upon relational and systemic factors as well as aptitude.

AB- This article explores the role of human relations in the process of curriculum change in social work education. Social Capital, the theoretical framework that underpins this research, explains how social resources are made available to social work faculty and groups for their own benefit. Using data from 88 surveys completed by social work educators, the findings are significant. In an age of technological advancements, human connections remain an important factor in influencing curriculum development in aging. This study also presents implications for social work faculty and administrators and discusses how best to organize social work conferences to promote curriculum change.

AB- This research evaluated the effectiveness of the Public Child Welfare Certification Program, a specialized child welfare program delivered in bachelor of social work (BSW) curricula across the state of Kentucky. This evaluation gathered data for 10 years on satisfaction with the program, preparation for work in the state's child welfare agency, commitment to the agency, and retention. Data were collected from 199 graduates and 84 supervisors at 6 months and 2 years postgraduation. Results indicate that workers and supervisors report a high level of preparedness, as well as high levels of commitment to and retention with the agency. Supervisor support, coworker support, and personal/professional stress were mediators of commitment to the agency. Implications for child welfare practice and social work education are discussed.

The original study used a cross-sectional, correlational survey design to gather information on practitioners' personal religious/spiritual beliefs and practices; professional attitudes, experiences, and behaviors; and professional education and training. Path analysis identified the specific direct and indirect relationships among 6 variables that accounted for nearly 69% of the variance in the use of spiritually based interventions with children and adolescents. The influence of personal background and attitudinal variables in the use of such interventions, coupled with the absence of education and training variables, raise concerns about practitioner decision making and ethical practice.

AB- The new Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) identify assessment as "an integral component of competency-based education." It is not new, however, that programs must demonstrate plans to assess attainment of competencies or expected program outcomes and show how data collection and analysis inform curriculum decisions. Previous work demonstrates that using the construct of self-efficacy is a promising assessment strategy. The current study develops and implements a comprehensive measure of MSW students' self-efficacy tailored to the objectives of a specific advanced MSW curriculum. Analyses are based on pretests and posttests from 117 MSW students. Results demonstrate significant gains in self-efficacy related to all 17 program objectives. Implications for social work program assessment in light of the 2008 EPAS are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social work educators have few guidelines to help them evaluate master's of social work applicants with criminal records. This study surveyed 280 field supervisors and asked them to rate their likelihood of rejecting a student with a criminal record depending on crime type and mitigating factors. Results found that supervisors' perception of risk was influenced by the nature of the crime, mitigating factors related to the crime, and, in some crime categories, agency type and personal characteristics of the respondent. Field supervisors' appraisals of risk diverged somewhat from criminological research, which generally uses mitigating factors rather than crime type to evaluate risk of recidivism.

AB- Teaching about race, racism, and oppression presents higher education programs with complex challenges. This article reports on the experiences of a new MSW program in designing a gateway "race, gender, and inequality" course. Embracing a theoretical base of culturally competent practice and solutions to the inherent difficulties of discussing race and oppression in diverse student groups is suggested along with six rules of engagement. Recommendations are based on the interactive experience of a highly diverse faculty and student body, literature review, student focus groups, faculty retreats, expert consultation, and curriculum refinement.

AB- This study examined the potential contribution of self-compassion to perceived competence and mental health in master's of social work students (N = 65). It was hypothesized that the components of self-compassion (i.e., mindfulness, common humanity, self-kindness, overidentification, isolation, and self-judgment) would impact perceived competence (sense of coherence), which in turn would mediate mental health (depressive symptom level). Students completed the Self-Compassion Scale, the Sense of Coherence Questionnaire, and the California Psychological Inventory-Depression Scale. Results showed that overidentification directly and indirectly (as mediated by decreased coherence) affected depressive symptom level. Implications for social work education are discussed.

AB- This study uses qualitative data from student Web logs (blogs) that were required for a graduate social work course addressing issues of privilege to examine the learning journey trajectory for students in a master's of social work program who participated in a single-identity caucus examining heterosexual privilege. The study includes reflections on the impact of the course on students' lives and social work practice that were gathered approximately 6 months after students had completed the course. What emerged was a five-stage learning journey that spans the resistance and redefinition phases of social identity development.

AB- The use of technology and online learning in social work education has increased in recent years. These innovations are having an impact on traditional education as they become integrated into face-to-face classes. The result has been a rising convergence between online and traditional education and the emergence of a new educational paradigm that aims to purposefully integrate elements of both approaches. This blended learning may have much potential for social work in providing educational opportunities that take advantage of the best of what both online and traditional education can offer. This article proposes that it is time for social work to more fully explore this new approach to education. Recommendations for research in evaluating the effectiveness of blended learning are made.

AB- Cultural competence is a fundamental tenet of social work education. Although cultural competence with diverse populations historically referred to individuals and groups from non-White racial origins, the term has evolved to encompass differences pertaining to sexuality, religion, ability, and others. Critics charge that the cultural competence model is largely ineffective and that its tendency to equalize oppressions under a "multicultural umbrella" unintentionally promotes a color-blind mentality that eclipses the significance of institutionalized racism. In this article we argue that critical race theory (CRT) can be used to address some of these noted problems with the cultural competence model. We define the major tenets of CRT and analyze its benefits and limitations for social work pedagogy around race, racism, and other oppressions.

AB- Despite the profound commitment of social work toward people living in poverty, the social work profession has failed to develop practice based on awareness of poverty. This article shows the ways in which poverty became a marginal issue in social work practice, reviews the literature on teaching poverty in international context, and then explicates the expected educational results and the main course and fieldwork contents. The proposed framework for poverty-aware social work education includes knowledge acquisition, structuring of professional values, skills development, and experiencing. A consideration of the ways in which this content may be integrated into the existing social work curriculum concludes this article.

AB- This study examined the field internship experiences of bilingual graduate social work students who worked with limited English proficiency (LEP) clients. Data were collected via a Web-based survey from 55 bilingual social work students. Respondents reported that LEP clients required more time and work and generally had more complicated cases than monolingual English clients. Working in two or more languages often fatigued respondents. Respondents frequently interpreted for monolingual staff but received no training in using professional terminology when interpreting. They reported that agencies had only some documents translated. One quarter of the sample stated that being bilingual interfered with their field education. The article closes with recommendations for augmenting the language skills of bilingual students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This survey provides valuable insight for social work educators into the goals and career intentions of working students who pursue master's degrees in social work, as compared to master's degrees in business. Social work graduate students were surveyed and compared to business graduate students in terms of their motivations for seeking advanced degrees and their expected career outcomes. Findings indicate that social work students were more motivated by a desire to gain knowledge or expertise in their service field, whereas business students differed in seeking greater career advancement and self-sufficiency. Social work implications for educational programs and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Although some academic scholars have called for adoption of evidence-based practice (EBP) as a unifying model for social work education and practice, controversies with the EBP approach for the social work profession still need to be examined. Some of the limitations of EBP to be recognized and addressed before recommending broad changes within social work education are described. Conceptual and definitional limitations include following a medical model, privileging certain types of evidence, and downplaying the importance of theory. Implementation and feasibility limitations include sorting the complexity of research information and providing necessary practice grounding and supervision to facilitate knowledge application. Dialogue on the role of EBP in social work education must continue. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Readers of this special edition on controversial issues in religion, spirituality, and social work might conclude that the articles have not arrived at final answers but have merely opened up lines of inquiry that require further follow-up and expansion. This certainly would be a justifiable conclusion since these and additional controversial issues remain to be explored in depth. In addition, some readers may not believe the issues described are actually serious enough to confront. However, the 12 articles in the special edition do provide a very solid beginning for an effort that should be ongoing. As noted earlier, some of the topics discussed raise extremely serious questions that have been ignored by social work because of either indifference or professional negligence. The purpose of this special edition about controversial issues in religion, spirituality, and social work is to serve as one of the external forces designed to bring about change in social work education and practice. Some of the issues lend themselves to easy answers while others are more difficult, but the starting point for all of them is open and honest communication and conversation. This has been the purpose of this special edition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This study uses the search terms “Baha'i,” “Buddh*,” “Confucian*,” “Christian,*” “Druze,” “Hindu*,” “Islam*,” “Muslim*,” “Jew*,” “Juda*,” “Sikh*,” “Tao*,” “Traditional Spirit*,” “Wicca,” and “Zoroastrian*” as keyword descriptors in abstracts of two databases—Social Work Abstracts and Social Service Abstracts—from the mid-1960s to 2007. It finds Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to have the most attention; nearly a third of all articles appear in what may be considered “high ranking” journals, and a large proportion of social work scholarship on faith traditions has been published since 1990. Thematic analysis also found that the main emphasis of the publications cluster around four main themes: (a) impact of faith traditions on social processes and issues, (b) impact of faith traditions on social work practice, (c) interrelationship between faith tradition and social work, and (d) factors to consider to promote religiously sensitive social work practice. The article concludes with implications for social work scholarship and practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Postmodernism has helped to illustrate that scientific advancement occurs most effectively in an academic milieu comprised of diverse perspectives. Furthermore, insiders—those with personal knowledge of the phenomena under study—are often uniquely positioned to contribute to scientific discourse. The increasing calls for research on spirituality and religion suggest the need for spiritual insiders to participate in the emerging conversation. While acknowledging the need for a variety of spiritual viewpoints, this paper explores the possibility of developing a theistic perspective in social work discourse. The possible contributions that such a perspective might add are discussed and some suggestions are offered for developing a theistic perspective.

AB- In the new millennium, spirituality has been accepted as an integral part of social work practice, enabling a holistic and strength-based approach to individuals, groups, and communities. This acceptance has been encouraged by the current interest in both religious and spiritual issues. The rationale for such inclusion is grounded in a review of the historical relationship between spirituality and social work, in the ethical mandates that underlie both the NASW Code of Ethics and the Standards for Cultural Competence in Social Work, and in the evolving definitions of social work areas of practice as biopsychosociocultural-spiritual. Thus, it must be viewed as an essential component of social work education. Because of the nature of spirituality and spiritual experiences and the potential for wide divergence in views, definitions, experiences, and understanding, spirituality is especially challenging to teach. Research indicates that students also identify spirituality as an essential component of social work practice and that they often feel ill prepared and equipped to address spiritual issues in practice after completing their social work education. Models, resources, and literature in this field have been developed by many researchers, particularly as they relate to special populations or fields within social work; yet the challenges persist. Spirituality may be taught as a discrete course, generally as an elective, and suggestions for material to be included in such a course are offered in the areas of knowledge acquisition, skill development, and self-awareness. However, it is recognized that material on spirituality should be infused throughout the social work curriculum, primarily in core courses such as practice, diversity, human behavior in the social environment, research, policy, and ethics, and specific suggestions are offered to encourage such inclusion. To increase students’ knowledge of the varieties of spiritual experiences of potential clients, a small random sample of the general population was interviewed regarding spiritual beliefs and experiences. Interviewees were asked to define spirituality, to share their experiences, and to suggest ways in which meaningful dialogue about spirituality might be encouraged in social work practice.

AB- Recent reports in the media have suggested that social work students are being discriminated against within BSW and MSW programs due to their religious beliefs. We review the substance of these public allegations and provide some further examples of religious discrimination occurring within the classroom, in faculty evaluations of students, and in being unfairly dismissed from social work programs. These individual stories, combined with contemporary empirical research on the topic, lend credence to the charge that religious discrimination within academic social work remains an ongoing problem. This reflects a failure on the part of the profession to promote social justice. Religious bigotry deserves the same attention by social workers as do instances of discrimination on the basis of race, gender, and sexual orientation. Some specific steps to remedy religious discrimination within social work academic programs are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The third section deals with the educational issues. There are numerous insights to be gained from the three articles dealing with religion, spirituality, and social work. The first is that religious discrimination against students, particularly evangelical Christians, may be widespread in social work education and little has been done to eliminate it. Continually framing discrimination issues and concerns as a social justice problem may help move forward to a solution. The second is that there are ways in which content about spirituality can effectively be including in the social work education curriculum. The third is that informed social work educators and practitioners are aware of hot-button topics such as homosexuality, abortion, and others that appear to be problematic from the perspective of some religions. However, when progressive religious values and social work values are overlaid, there are commonalities that point to ways in which these problems can be solved.

AB- The use of complementary and alternative interventions by health care clinicians, in particular social workers, as a method to relieve chronic conditions, such as depressive symptoms in older adults, is addressed in this paper. Psychotherapy, pharmaceuticals, and other medical interventions are often enhanced when accompanied by alternative practices like yoga. Practitioners can learn to use these methods and/or work with a clinician who has a particular alternative skill set. Bringing complementary interventions into one’s practice assures that older adults are receiving "best practices." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article provides a review of the literature regarding social workers’ use of spiritually based interventions, factors predictive of such use, research on ethical issues, and findings related to educational preparation for spiritually sensitive practice. Results show that both social work practitioners and students are utilizing a substantial number of spiritually based interventions, that workers’ personal spirituality is influential in intervention use, that there is no evidence of adherence to specific ethical guidelines, and that the majority of social workers receive little or no instruction on religion and spirituality in their professional programs. Recommendations for social work education, research, and practice are proposed for meeting the ethical challenges suggested by these findings.

AB- Global survival is arguably the most significant ecobiopsychosocial-spiritual issue of our era. It will require historically new levels of cooperation between the world's religions, corporations, and nations to bring about a quality postsurvival era. The current religious resurgence has given religion the potential to be a key partner in the cooperative effort to ensure global survival and a postsurvival quality world. Social work, with its ecological perspective, is specially qualified to work with religions toward these goals. Several principles are available to do this, and in particular the use of spirituality can be a conceptual bridge to bring about cooperation between the several entities involved in this process.

AB- This paper proposes that the difficulty some religious traditions have with homosexuality represents a crisis of authority within those religions. Sources of religious authority are usually categorized as scripture, tradition, and reason; some traditions add experience. The paper reconstructs the religious debate into a possibly irreconcilable dialogue between closed (tribal) and open (individualistic) societies. Social work, a construction of an open society, must be interested in this debate because of the impact on society, families, and individuals, and may support both lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons as well as religious conservatives by reframing the debate.

AB- There exists considerable conflict between the current social work worldview and that espoused by traditional Christianity. While the conflict is most evident in specific definitions of general social work values, innate differences in foundational assumptions of competing philosophical perspectives make such conflict inevitable. An attempt to utilize pluralism in two forms to reconcile differences while somewhat successful is inherently incomplete. The failure of pluralistic solutions is primarily due to the issue of exclusivity. New philosophical principles need to be explored and applied to the problem of competing and exclusive worldviews if social work is to advance developing a comprehensive value base.

AB- To facilitate movement toward a more equitable society, this paper explores the construct of secular privilege. In keeping with a critical perspective, power differentials are examined and illustrated in the nation’s most influential medium for constructing public discourse—broadcast programming. Given the pervasiveness and invisibility of secular privilege, representative privileges are delineated. A subsample of these are deconstructed to provide insight into the benefits secular people typically enjoy and strategies are offered to help decenter the dominant narrative. Resistance will likely be encountered from those who are granted power by the current social structure, but productive change is possible since many secular people are committed to creating a more democratically representative society.

AB- David Hodge has published extensively in this journal and in others as well on a variety of issues pertaining to religion and spirituality in social work. He continues by expanding this body of work by leading off in this section with an article dealing with secular privilege. Controversy has always existed in social work about whether it possesses a clearly articulated and coherent philosophical foundation. Social work has always maintained that it possesses the three attributes that are inherent to a profession: a confirmed knowledge base, a set of agreed-on skills, and a value base. The position of many religions that have strong doctrinal teachings about same-sex sexuality leads to barriers between those traditions and persons who are homosexual. Many expert observers and commentators of geopolitical issues have raised serious concerns about global survival and the subsequent challenges that would face a postsurvival world.

AB- Religion and the sometimes associated phenomenon of spirituality have waxed and waned in importance in public life in America. There are many reasons for this, but an early and central one stems from the position taken by Thomas Jefferson during the time of the American Revolution. The influence of religion waned after social work began to solidify as a profession, and certainly after Freudian psychoanalysis began to take hold as its philosophical foundation. A secular humanistic orientation took over for decades, but then in a direct and pronounced fashion in the mid-1980s information about religion and spirituality began to emerge in social work practice and education. This special edition of the Journal of Religion and Spirituality in Social Work was planned to explore some of these controversies. There are multiple ways to go about identifying the religious and spiritual disagreements and controversies in social work, some more rigorous and valid than others. The special edition of the journal includes the 12 articles that emerged from this process. The overall purpose of the special issue is to engender reflection about controversial issues in religion, spirituality, and social work, and to stimulate further speculation, discussion, and scholarship.

AB- Teaching policy analysis is compared to teaching research skills. Both involve the selection of an appropriate analytical tool to be used with multiple units of analysis; and in both, the selected instrument must fit the purpose of the analysis or the product is not useful. Policy analysis frameworks characteristically address policy process, content, and performance. However, these frameworks are based on different worldviews, with embedded assumptions and with deep philosophical roots that may be rational (classical), interpretive, or progressive (radical). These different assumptions can lead to very different analytical expectations and results. Here, we justify teaching policy analysis as research, categorize a number of frameworks, and provide recommendations for equipping students to critically assess issues that arise in the development and use of policy analysis frameworks.

AB- The growing interest in social work education in Israel over the past 5 years, despite its current social and political context, was the impetus for this study, which attempted to identify the practice orientations of 119 incoming BSW students in an antisocial era. Two distinct, equal-size clusters were found. Half of the students were micropractice oriented, indicating greater interest in working with individuals, couples, and families. The other half were macropractice oriented, more interested in working with communities and in policy-practice and social change activities. Conclusions and implications for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Interdisciplinarity in doctoral education currently is strongly advocated by governments and universities as important in developing knowledge useful in addressing significant public problems. However, the efficacy of these claims has not been subject to empirical investigation. Using longitudinal data covering a 13-year period, this research addresses this limitation by examining how variation in interdisciplinary emphasis in social work doctoral programs affects the scholarly orientation and productivity of graduates. The findings suggest that interdisciplinary doctoral education makes a difference, with graduates from programs with higher levels of interdisciplinarity demonstrating more generalist scholarly orientations, and achieving higher levels of scholarly productivity.

AB- A convenience sample of MSW students responded to an Internet-based survey (N = 2,289) retrospectively reporting their reasons for enrolling in a specific social work graduate program. Responses indicate that MSW students who enroll in private graduate programs are younger and reported reputation-related and employment-related reasons for specific school selection more often than students enrolled in public schools. Students enrolled in public schools reported location-related reasons as more important. Bifurcation of the applicant pool into private and public preference-groups presents a recruitment challenge. Other findings include that enrollment rates are substantially higher than previously anticipated, which suggests that most applicants to graduate social work programs are likely to be admitted if they apply to multiple programs.

AB- A survey of 118 MSW students was conducted to examine the relationship between social work students' knowledge about, contact with, and attitudes toward persons with schizophrenia. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that students' knowledge about and contact with persons with schizophrenia were significantly related to better attitudes toward this population. Moderated multiple regression analyses revealed a significant interaction between knowledge about and contact with persons with schizophrenia, such that knowledge was only related to positive attitudes among students who had more personal contact with individuals with the illness. Implications for social work training in severe mental illness are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Little is known about evidence-based practice (EBP) in social service agencies beyond studies of researcher, practitioner, and educator opinions. The Bringing Evidence for Social Work Training (BEST) Project involved 16 participants from 3 social service agencies. The experiential training, delivered by 2 doctoral students, focused on a team-identified practice issue and followed the EBP process of motivation, question formulation, search, evaluation, and application planning. Posttraining focus group data were analyzed. Results suggest that university researchers who based in schools of social work can successfully collaborate with agencies to support the process of identifying, evaluating, and discussing the application of research evidence in practice. University-agency training partnerships should be considered as 1 of many potential strategies for advancing EBP in social work.

AB- Portfolios can foster the integration of theory, action, self-reflection, and assessment. Electronic portfolios (ePortfolios) extend this concept by acting as a "content-management system" that facilitates the collecting, considering, sharing, and presenting of learning outcomes with and to others via a digital medium. This article describes the systematic examination of an ePortfolio application under development and illustrates its potential usefulness to not only facilitate and assess individual student learning, but also aid curricular assessment. Our evaluation uncovered organizational, curricular, learning, logistical, and technological issues involved in moving from a linear approach to teaching and learning toward an integrated systems approach.

AB- This article evaluates a learning method that used theatre students as family clients in an advanced social work practice course. Data from 47 advanced graduate students showed that observing peers conduct simulated sessions can be an effective and valued learning experience. Quantitative findings indicated that simulations are perceived to be better learning experiences than peer role-plays, and that students associate observation of a peer with improvement in their own skills. Qualitative responses described useful components of the simulation method in relation to specific domains of professional learning and provided highly favorable assessments of the simulation method.

AB- As frontline mental health care providers, social workers need to be prepared to confront and properly manage substance abuse issues in practice. This study examined predictors of recent master of social work (MSW) graduates' perceptions of preparedness to practice in the area of substance abuse. A cross sectional design was used, and 232 recent MSW graduates completed a mail-in survey (65.7% response rate). Respondents were more likely to perceive themselves as prepared to work with substance abuse issues if they received more formal academic training in substance abuse and had higher knowledge of substance abuse concepts and models. The findings support the need to include substance abuse education in social work curricula. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study examined changes among graduate students (N = 52) in perception of social worker empowerment and commitment to client empowerment through social justice advocacy. Pre-post data showed that most entering MSW students possessed important beliefs about empowerment for themselves as social workers and for members of oppressed population groups. During their graduate education, significant positive change occurred in both aspects of empowerment, and social worker empowerment and commitment to client empowerment were positively associated. Belief in a just world has a significant, positive effect on worker empowerment, and an internal locus of control is associated with social worker empowerment and commitment to client empowerment.

Very few of the pre-admission variables were found to be significantly associated with performance. These findings and the role of the admissions process are discussed. In addition to the usual academic criteria, the authors urge schools to include a focus on nonacademic criteria during the admissions process and the ongoing educational program.

The authors designed a 3-part approach to curriculum development and innovation: (1) increasing students' interest and exposure to aging contents through curriculum innovation, (2) faculty development, and (3) cultivation of an aging-rich environment. Outcomes of the curriculum infusion and integration, in terms of students' attitudes toward older adults and gerontological competency, were assessed via surveys of 3 groups of BSW students whose method of exposure to aging content differed. Respondents demonstrated improved attitudes and gerontology competence. Recommendations for an effective curriculum change and implications for gerontological social work education are discussed.

AB- This article examines the impact of a curricular infusion strategy to integrate multigenerational practice issues into social work education. Based on a survey of MSW students (N = 83), findings illustrate that student interest, knowledge, and skills in aging and multigenerational practice increased significantly following the implementation of a 3-tiered infusion approach. While the majority of students endorsed aging and multigenerational issues as important to social work in general, many did not understand the relevance to their own careers. In general, students were more interested in multigenerational rather than gerontological practice, both in relation to acquiring additional knowledge and skills and in pursuing further coursework. Next steps are outlined for integrating a multigenerational practice perspective into social work education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In an effort to strengthen the basic aging competency of social work students, the authors assessed the general quantity and quality of aging content in a sample of foundation social work textbooks. Of nearly 10,000 pages reviewed, only about 3% (309 pages) included aging content. A foundation cultural diversity text included the most aging content (6%), with only 5% aging-related content identified in HBSE texts, 2% across practice books reviewed, 4% within policy texts, 2% in research texts, and less than 1 page in the 1 field education text. A textbook analysis framework and a review of findings are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Educational outcomes are compared for students taking a social work administration course in 3 formats: traditional, Internet, and hybrid. The traditional group had face-to-face instruction, whereas the Internet students received all instruction through the Internet. The hybrid students had a balance between the two. Course readings and assignments were the same for each group. The results indicated no difference among these 3 groups in knowledge gain, course content self-efficacy gain, or student satisfaction. These data add to the growing body of research suggesting that online instruction achieves outcomes comparable with the traditional format.

AB- This article presents qualitative insights into the roles of master's of social work programs in developing student practice interests in working with people with developmental disabilities (DD). Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 MSW social workers practicing in the field of DD in the north-eastern United States. Participants discussed personal and professional rewards of practice with people with DD, what they want MSW students to know about working with people with DD, current opportunities in the DD field, their MSW coursework and fieldwork experiences, and ways MSW programs could further develop student interest in working with people with DD. Implications of the findings for MSW programs are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Research about the relative importance of faculty performance of teaching, scholarship, and service work roles in tenure and promotion decisions is reviewed and updated. Data collected from 130 deans or directors through Internet administration of the Work Role Salience Index (Green & Baskind, 2007) suggested some variation in the weighting of tenure and promotion decisions among different programs and among different types of programs. However, scholarship was salient at a majority of institutions; teaching and service roles have become less influential over time. Conflict between these findings and findings about workload time allocated to scholarship, teaching, and service are identified and implications discussed.

AB- This study extends research on the field supervisory relationship by examining general attachment style and supervision-specific attachment style in a sample of 72 master's-level social work students. Attachment variables were investigated in relation to student perceptions of the supervisory working alliance and supervisory style. Students with higher levels of general attachment avoidance were more likely to develop insecure attachment-related responses to their supervisor. General attachment was mostly unrelated to supervisory alliance and supervisory style variables. Supervision-specific attachment strongly predicted the supervisory alliance and supervisory style, regardless of students' general attachment styles.

AB- This study employed a unique theoretical approach and a series of participant-based ethnographic interviewing techniques that are traditionally used in cognitive anthropology to examine and compare social work and anthropology students' cultural models of the causes of domestic violence. The study findings indicate that although social work students and anthropology students share understandings of a general model of domestic violence, social work students agree on distinctive elements of this model that anthropology students do not. These findings are important in better understanding the role social work education plays in developing social workers' understandings of the roots of domestic violence.

AB- With the advent of the 2nd wave of the women's movement, numerous voices within social work academia called for the inclusion of gendered content in the curriculum. The subsequent addition of content on women was a pivotal achievement for the social work profession. However, gender is an increasingly slippery concept. A current call for re-gendering the social work curriculum includes continued emphasis on the importance of the concept of gender while acknowledging that men have a gender, too. The call for a more comprehensive understanding of gender includes new conceptualizations of women; more complex understandings of femimsm(s); content on men, masculinities, and transgender issues; and methods for teaching a critical gender consciousness. Specific class exercises and film recommendations are included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Nineteen instruments met inclusion criteria. Of these, 4 are recommended for social work education. Points of discussion include the ability of scales to transcend disciplinary boundaries, scales as cultural artifacts, and emerging tensions in scale construction. This study calls for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop instruments, pool knowledge, and work toward a socially just world.

AB- Social work students are exposed to academic and fieldwork stressors that challenge preexisting self-concepts and worldviews and temporarily reduce personal competence and mental health. The current study examined the role of mindfulness in explaining the variation in competence and mental health between 37 entering and 28 graduating masters of social work students. Using a paper-pencil survey, graduating second-year students reported significantly lower mindfulness, personal competence, and mental health than incoming first-year students. Furthermore, mindfulness significantly mediated the two groups’ variation in personal competence and mental health. Implications are discussed.

AB- A sample of 301 outpatient clients from a large substance abuse treatment facility was surveyed on spirituality and treatment outcome constructs utilizing a pretest/posttest design. Clients were surveyed prior to participating in outpatient treatment and then approximately seven months after discharge from treatment. Spirituality was measured multidimensionally to determine any contribution to treatment outcomes, including health, mental health, and substance use outcomes. Analyses were conducted to determine if spirituality changed over the study period and whether spirituality was affected by client characteristics at the beginning of treatment or impacted outcomes after treatment. Results indicated that many spiritual dimensions were important in treatment outcomes and that treatment history had some effect for posttest substance use. In general, the relationship was stronger for the spiritual dimensions than the religious dimensions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- There is a great deal of research on intimate partner violence, but few studies investigate the role of Evangelical religious and cultural values on intimate partner violence or faith-based prevention and interventions strategies in this community. This study with 8 Evangelical pastors and 11 clinicians contributes to the literature by examining the effect of religious values and social attitudes on intimate partner violence in the Evangelical community and investigating a range of faith-based interventions that may be utilized by mental health providers. The results focus on two themes: religious values and social attitudes and the use of faith-based interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article examines the shifts in rhetorical footing between a professional counselor (the author), clients, and bishops who all belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The paper presents three domains in which switches in footing, or the orientation from which the counselor speaks, are necessary to balance potential conflicts between commitments of faith and commitments to professional values and ethics. These are the rhetorical discourses of doctrine versus profession, absolutism versus relativism, and biological versus spiritual treatment. The author provides examples of strategies and shifts in footing, or discursive orientation, used to maintain integrity and fidelity in his potentially contradictory roles when working with LDS clients and bishops.

AB- Although tolerance is a foundational social work value, surprisingly little has been written on the subject. Given the challenges posed by the nation's growing diversity, we believe that the topic warrants some discussion. In this article, we construct a rationale for Christian social workers to exhibit tolerance based upon the concept of the imago Dei, or the image of God. Our hope, however, is that others will join this postmodern-based conversation, developing arguments for tolerance that draw from, and speak to, individuals from an array of narratives. By populating professional discourse with a variety of strengths-based rationales for tolerance, social work might model a new framework for addressing differences in an increasingly diverse and often polarized society.

AB- This article describes research to develop a breast health intervention for women in Hawaiian churches. Native Hawaiian women are disproportionately burdened by breast disease and tend to be diagnosed at advanced stages when treatment options are more limited. Research suggests that cultural conflict may be a factor in Hawaiian women's underutilization of conventional health services. Phenomenological approaches guided data collection and analysis to explore the influence of religiosity and ethnocultural tradition in coping with breast cancer. The overarching theme was kakou (we or us), which emphasized ways of coping oriented to the family collective and focused on family well-being. Findings offer a portal for understanding the lived experience of survivors and families in Hawaiian churches. Considerations are suggested for those practitioners assisting clients from collectivist-oriented cultures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Within the spirituality movement adopted by the helping professions a relatively new field of knowledge has developed, of contemplation and contemplative theory and practice, which has not yet been recognized in social work. We present major elements of contemplative theory and identify mindfulness and mindfulness meditation as viable procedures for social work practice, because they have specific relevance for individual, family, and group modalities. Contemplative theory is discussed in relation to transpersonal theory. Contemplative theory is also concerned with the psycho-spiritual development of both client and worker and meets the need for a spiritual component in social work practice.

A total of 65 MSW students participated in a paper-and-pencil survey. Of these, 25 were religious, i.e., claimed membership in an organized religion, and 33 did not. Religious students endorsed religious comfort and strain and spiritual involvement more strongly than nonreligious students. Religious comfort was associated with spiritual involvement in both groups, but religious comfort and strain were related only in nonreligious students. Using multivariate analysis, mindfulness emerged as the only significant predictor of reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms in both religious and nonreligious students alike. Implications of study findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The qualitative data were analyzed using a grounded theory methodology to determine the themes that were provided by the participants. This article will explore five recurring themes, including: (a) religiosity as external behaviors; (b) religiosity as internalized beliefs; (c) spirituality as acknowledging a “spiritual reality”; (d) spirituality as connectedness to God; and (e) interconnectedness of religiosity and spirituality. Narratives will be offered to support and illustrate each of these themes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- In recent journal articles, David R. Hodge charged that the social work profession discriminates against Evangelical Christians and other “people of faith.” His assertions stimulated a deluge of debate in the social work literature. In this article, Fowler's faith development theory is used to consider the dynamics of the controversy from a different angle. Fowler claims that a “revolution in consciousness” is taking place and makes recommendations for facilitating the change. Using Fowler's recommendations, social work professionals are encouraged to move beyond skillful debate to an atmosphere where individuals with very different worldviews can enter into dialogue, hear each other, and learn from what is heard. Necessary leadership, productive problem solving, and ethical practices related to personal values are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social work's long-standing dual focus on person and environment has been heavily weighted toward an emphasis on the person as subject with the environment in the background as modifier or context. A broad notion of spirituality now expressed in the social work literature has the potential to transform our limited notion of person and environment, if we can come to understand ourselves as elements of a living environment. When we move toward a perspective of person as environment, we begin to see ourselves as dynamic components of a living system. Such transformation calls social work to look beyond interpersonal relationships to the very nature of our spiritual connection with the planet we inhabit—literally our “common ground”.

AB- The final two papers in this special issue examine broad current issues that are increasingly being taken up by members of the profession and which will impact and shape our future work. Need of social work is discussed to extend its notion of person-in-environment to actually include more of a focus on people’s physical environment. The second article in this section addresses an issue that is complex and emotionally laden for many people, that is, considering how fundamentalist belief systems and practitioners and students with fundamentalist religious beliefs fit within a mainstream social work approach. While the abstract and experiential nature of spirituality makes it difficult to study, especially with positivist research paradigms, we urge social workers to move into research that would explore in-depth the processes, intricacies, and effectiveness of spirituality for a myriad of social work practices.

AB- The Chronicles of Narnia and, in particular, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, are amongst the most popular children's stories ever written. The stories have been enjoyed by many cultural groups accustomed to receiving “teachings” through folk-tales, metaphors, talking animals, and mythical creatures. They examine universal issues and feelings: grief and loss, social justice and service to humanity, abuse and healing, and greed and goodness. The Narnia stories offer social work educators and practitioners a rich source of material for self-reflection and self-other awareness.

AB- Informed by Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) theory of stress and coping, the current study examined the buffering effect of self-detachment against emotional exhaustion among second-year MSW students, controlling for social support. Utilizing triangulation, 28 students completed a quantitative survey, and a subset of 22 students also participated in a qualitative interview. Both quantitative and qualitative results supported the hypothesized buffering effect of self-detachment and social support against emotional exhaustion. Implications for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The articles in this section examines the role of self-detachment, a spiritual notion of compassion for oneself, as protection against burnout in social work students in their field placements. Methods of incorporation in social work education to enhance self-detachment are also recommended. Mindfulness mediation is one such method; a specific classroom example is provided.

AB- It has been argued that social workers would make valuable additions to Catholic church parish teams. A plan for how this could occur is presented using the tenets of the generalist model of social work practice, which consists of seven components: engagement, assessment, planning, implementation, evaluation, termination, and follow-up. The addition of social workers to a parish team would not only enhance the wellness of individual parishes, but also has the potential to enhance the wellness of the broader community.

AB- The literature on spirituality and social work reveals a shift from an initial stage of defining concepts like spirituality and religion and their relevance to social work and to current implementation of spiritually oriented techniques in therapy. This reflects epistemological and ontological shifts as social work has opened up to holistic and transpersonal theories assuming the existence of a metaphysical reality. Within these paradigmatic shifts, mindfulness has emerged as a central practice to expand consciousness for the purpose of self-observation and knowing the world. Recent research demonstrates that mindfulness can gradually achieve outcomes like acceptance, letting go, trust, non-judgmental attitude, and self-awareness. In addition to its facilitation of individual change in clients' internal and external worlds, mindfulness has the potential to effect change in therapists, in the profession of social work, and in the world at large.

AB- Traditionally, in the field of trauma, the emphasis has been on loss and suffering rather than growth and possibility. While the experience of loss and suffering is true for many trauma survivors, especially during the initial phase of trauma exposure, recent research has demonstrated that sole concentration on these constructs is ineffective in promoting growth and understanding. This article focuses on the benefits of attention to the spiritual aspect in posttraumatic growth and transcendent meaning making. A critical component in assisting individuals to move beyond the immediate impact of trauma is the facilitation of spiritual awareness and accessing spiritual resources. The inclusion of spirituality in the post-trauma processes can provide alternatives for positive reconstruction of worldview, coping, and transcendent meaning making.

AB- This study explored stressful experiences and the roles that spirituality played among 68 respondents with a history of substance abuse and incarceration. Qualitative data from face-to-face interviews were analyzed using an iterative, grounded theory process of constant comparisons. Principal themes included utilizing spirituality to cope with adversity; understand one's own true nature; transform one's character; seek redemption for past transgressions; save, care for, or liberate others; modify the use of substances; repay the debt of having one's life spared; and develop a relationship with a divine entity. Within the context of these themes, the application of spiritual principles to social work practice, research, and education is discussed.

AB- Discussions focused on spiritually sensitive social work practice constitute a large part of the literature in this field. This is not surprising given that the impetus to include spirituality in the profession derives, in large part, from social work’s practitioner base and client demands. If the North American spirituality and social work literature is examined as a whole, several themes become apparent. One area of agreement is the rationales for incorporating spirituality into practice. These include the issues raised by clients, cultural diversities, coping resources, social work’s holistic approach, the need for knowledge development, and the effectiveness of spiritually influenced interventions. Some of the articles demonstrate the continued influence of practitioners’ interests and innovations in this field, and illustrate how social work continues to progress in its development of knowledge in this area. We should also think about how we can more thoroughly and extensively study and investigate spiritually influenced intervention methods and their impact on client change.

It presents definitions of spirituality and religion, considers possible boundary violating and harmful impacts of inappropriate social work approaches to spirituality, and introduces contemporary trends in connections with spirituality in social work. Themes to inspire boundary transcendence are introduced, including transformation, liminality, harmony between opposites, and death of the self. Finally, some implications for social work arising from mental clarity are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The article considers this question in the context of not succumbing to the bullshit of capitalist estrangement, finding our sources of inspiration, finding and experiencing our soul's destiny, understanding our diverse collection of spiritual foundations, being surprised, and thus reclaiming the meaning of happiness.

AB- This article presents findings of an exploratory study addressing social work program practices regarding psychiatric disabilities among social work students. An e-mail invitation to participate in an online survey was sent to approximately 875 social work educators, with 71 individuals choosing to participate. The findings indicated that 88% of respondents were in programs that had made accommodations and slightly less than 33% were in programs that had psychiatric disability policies. A positive relationship between ratings of the effectiveness of the accommodations and ratings of employability of students with psychiatric disabilities was found. These findings suggest that additional studies are needed to identify effective ways to deal with the complex legal and educational issues involved with accommodations and support.

AB- Because no distinction is made in the Council on Social Work Education's educational standards about the frequency, intensity, or pervasiveness of the various forms of oppression, social work education affirms what may be called the equality-of-oppressions paradigm. This article contends that, although the equality-of-oppressions paradigm is a valuable perspective, its ascendancy in social work education may be placing the coverage of people-of-color content at risk of being diminished. This article examines two implications of the equality-of-oppressions paradigm for people-of-color content: (1) the expanded definition of diversity, and (2) racism's persistence in social work education. The article also offers a model of differential vulnerability to help prioritize the various forms of oppression important to social work education.

SU- Adolescent Development; Early Experience; Violence
AB- Compared with other segments of the population, adolescents and, in particular, African Americans are disproportionately exposed to family and community violence. Research has consistently documented that exposure to such violence is often associated with psychological difficulties, poor educational and behavioral outcomes, and juvenile justice problems. Despite these compelling findings, many youth are not routinely assessed for such violence exposure and its ramifications by the educational, child welfare, social service, and juvenile justice systems with which they frequently interact. This article examines the prevalence of violence exposure within the family and community and its associated consequences among youth. Subsequently, the article proposes several practice and policy recommendations aimed at reducing the far-reaching effects of such violence exposure among youth.

AB- Social workers serve a varied population. Therefore, exemplary social work practice requires a depth of knowledge and skills that cut across diverse cultural contexts. Because of the universal characteristics of storytelling, this article proposes the use of storytelling as a viable conduit and instructional strategy for teaching cultural competence in schools of social work. By investigating the content, structure, and process of storytelling among, between, and across cultural groups, social work students will be able to develop and integrate an awareness, sensitivity, understanding, and appreciation for the experiential realities of diverse client groups.

AB- This article presents a theoretical process model for students engaging in dialogic learning about issues of race and anti-oppression. The model identifies conditions present in the dialogue process and demonstrates how these conditions, when coordinated with certain interventions and strategies, help to create particular outcomes for participants. Using qualitative data from 13 intergroup dialogue participants this model builds from previous research that links bias and prejudice reduction to positive and sustained intergroup contact. Results suggest that students involved in this dialogic learning process are also involved in a process of recategorization and efforts to promote social change.

Data from foundation and advanced employment-based and nonemployment-based students (N = 180) indicate statistically significant gains during the academic year. Pre- and post-evaluative data from field instructors (N = 22) also reflect statistical significance. This counters concerns about the value of employment-based internships. There was a trend for employment-based foundation MSW students to perceive themselves initially as more knowledgeable than nonemployment-based students. By the end of the foundation year, this difference disappeared. Recommendations are made for employment-based field practica.

Using a mixed analytical approach, the researchers organized answers into a phenomenological arrangement describing the military social worker experience of being a uniformed helping professional during war. This project explored the unique experience of practicing social work in a combat zone including graduate social work education and continuing educational courses considered helpful to them while deployed.

AB- For many years, social workers have tried to establish their profession as one based on scientific principles. Following the tradition of medicine, influential leaders in social work are challenging clinicians and researchers to develop and implement evidence-based practice (EBP) models. Although various authors have discussed cautions in social work's move toward EBP, 1 issue—the influence of managed care and a market-driven economy on EBP in health and mental health care—has received less discussion. The purpose of this article is to discuss the parallel development of managed care and EBP, the possible influences of managed care on EBP, and the difficult issues faced by social workers in acting in the best interest of clients in a managed-care environment.

AB- Different views of evidence-based practice (EBP) include defining it as the use of empirically-validated treatments and practice guidelines (i.e., the EBPs approach) in contrast to the broad philosophy and related evolving process described by the originators. Social workers can draw on their code of ethics and accreditation standards both to select a view of EBP that is most faithful to related obligations and to address obstacles to implementing it. For example, the Code of Ethics (National Association of Social Workers, 1999) calls on social workers to draw on practice- and policy-related research findings, to honor informed consent guidelines, and to respect clients and empower them.

In this paper, we present a framework to aid instructors' understanding of and response to conflict in the classroom, which is unavoidable. We propose the reflective practitioner paradigm along with the contributions of mindfulness, as useful for social work instructors in examining their practice as educators. We conclude with practice principles that integrate 3 bodies of knowledge: reflective practice, mindfulness, and social work pedagogy on diversity. These principles apply to the individual educator, communication among educators, and social work departments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article makes specific suggestions for teaching evidence-based practice (EBP) in the master's-in-social-work (MSW) curriculum. The authors use the model of EBP as it was originally conceived: a process for posing empirically answerable questions, finding and evaluating the best available evidence, and applying that evidence in conjunction with client characteristics and practitioner judgment. The authors suggest that EBP, in its original form, is both sufficiently well operationalized and flexible to serve as a primary paradigmatic component of social work education. Furthermore, EBP carries a series of distinct advantages for MSW education that have not been widely recognized to date. These include the provision of a structure for more explicitly recognizing client factors, bridging the micro-macro and researcher-clinician divides, and emphasizing the professionalism of MSW-level practice. Specific curricular components are proposed and discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article critically analyzes challenges that may influence whether evidence-based practice (EBP) enjoys more success than previous efforts to improve the integration of practice and research in social work education. Key challenges include: (1) alleviating disparities in how EBP is being defined by social work educators; (2) maximizing the feasibility of implementing the EBP process appropriately after graduation, while at the same time preparing students not to over-rely on authoritative publications that designate certain interventions as evidence-based; and (3) preventing evidentiary standards from getting softened to the point that EBP becomes a meaningless term, as any study, regardless of its methodological rigor, can be cited to justify deeming an intervention to be evidence based.

AB- Researchers are grappling with the challenges of implementing evidence-based practice in community organizations. This article reviews factors that facilitate the use of evidence-based practice in community settings along with future steps necessary for successful translation of knowledge into community agencies. Social workers are uniquely qualified to address the research-practice gap because of their experience working and conducting research in community organizations. The creation of community-focused learning models that reinvent faculty-agency partnerships are important components of effective implementation. The infusion of evidence-based practice components throughout the social work curriculum is also critical for preparing social workers to implement effective practices.

AB- Little is known about field placement experiences of growing subgroups of students, particularly older, part-time, and field employment-based. Because of the centrality of field placements within MSW education, these student subgroups in field placements at one northeastern school were surveyed (N=779). A MANOVA analysis examined students' experiences with field setting, field supervision, and faculty field liaison. Results revealed that part-time, employment-based, or advanced-year students were significantly more positive about field experiences than full-time, non-employment-based, or foundation-year students. Age was not a significant factor. Implications of findings for admissions decisions, teaching, and structure of field education programs are discussed.

As in the original study, evidence was found regarding the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of this measure. First, internal reliability estimates for the FPSE all exceeded .95. Second, in terms of validity, the large positive correlation that had been predicted between the FPSE and the Social Work Empowerment scale was observed. Third, the amount of change in students' FPSE total scale scores between pretest and posttest was statistically significant.

The results indicate that only about 1/3 of the students consider the treatment of clients with basic needs to be a part of the profession. In addition, a positive correlation was found between willingness to help clients with basic needs and: (a) the student having been in a state of self-need; (b) the level of clients' distress; and (c) the availability of means to supply basic necessities. The results are discussed in relation to the social work curriculum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Issues that required clarification included: definitions of plagiarism, steps to take when confronted with suspected plagiarism, the role of the administrative disciplinary committee, and the range of consequences. At a minimum, consensus was needed regarding faculty steps in confronting suspected plagiarism to ensure equitable treatment of students and to fulfill the school's role as a gatekeeper to the profession. This article describes the concerns, steps, and outcomes of the work that was conducted. We offer recommendations and invite further professional discussion about this educational issue.

AB- The use of experiential approaches to teach social welfare policy suggests that such methods may increase undergraduate social work students' knowledge of and skill in working on social and economic justice issues. This article compares 2 such methods using qualitative and quantitative approaches. The first teaches social welfare policy as a service learning course and the second integrates social welfare policy into the students' practicum experience. The authors conclude that both approaches are equally effective in helping students to increase their knowledge of policy concepts and may help students feel more competent in using policy-related skills.

AB- When the National Association of Social Workers (1999) ratified the Code of Ethics in 2000, it was an acknowledgement that dual relationships can be part of sound social work practice. The educational materials that are available to educators do not move sufficiently beyond a risk-reduction approach to dual relationships to an assessment of how a dual relationship can be assessed and ethically maintained. This article presents discussion on the practice and cultural issues that influence dual relationships in various environments, reviews the materials available to social work educators, and describes how social work educators can train students for making more complex assessments of potential dual relationships. The article includes recommendations for problem-solving models that are applicable to the complexity of dual relationship assessment and recommends more descriptive vocabulary to assist in contextualizing discussions about dual relationships.

AB- Populations traditionally served by social workers are experiencing increasingly severe psychosocial stressors, necessitating that students be trained in crisis intervention. This paper provides educators with a theoretical framework integrating generalist practice and crisis intervention, which is applied to compelling case studies from September 11 with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. The authors provide guidelines for discussion and teaching points to structure didactic and collaborative problem-based learning and encourage instructors to use examples from their own and their students' practice. Students learn to intervene with their clients and to appreciate the vital role that social workers assume in responding to disasters.

AB- This article proposes a model for interprofessional collaboration within the context and process of field experiences in public schools. The model evolved out of a collaborative venture between the schools of social work and education at Boston College. The placement of pairs of social work and education interns in urban schools provided an opportunity to identify the nature of collaboration that is transdisciplinary and not parallel practice. This transdisciplinary practice model is based on a common goal, discipline-specific objectives, and co-facilitated activities. The discussion includes issues of project design and implementation as well as the advantages and challenges of interprofessional field work.

AB- This study evaluated 99 baccalaureate social work students' reactions to simulation kits that replicated visual impairments common with the aging process. Through qualitative research methods, students' preconceived notions and reported incidents of ageism were assessed in light of their reactions to increased understanding of visual changes. The outcome was greater self-awareness and critical reflection of ageism and discrimination. Students reported enhanced awareness of personal, social, and professional implications. This research supports previous data which suggest that increased exposure to activities that simulate the disabilities and experiences of oppression in older adults provide an opportunity to reduce ageism.

AB- The Geriatric Social Work Practicum Partnership Program was funded to attract graduate students to the field of aging and to strengthen field education in geriatric social work. Rotation was selected to achieve the program's goals to provide students with exposure to the spectrum of care in geriatric social work services. This paper describes the program's experience with rotation, which is the planned and systematic movement of students between two or more field practicum sites and supervision from more than one field instructor. Implementing rotation required the establishment of a university-community partnership. Students' positive reaction to rotation indicates that it warrants further implementation and evaluation (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The aging of the United States population is creating an increased need for social workers and other helping professionals with training in gerontology. Recent estimates indicate that less than 3% of MSW students are enrolled in an aging concentration, as compared to 19.0% enrolled in children/youth concentrations. This study (N=126) examines factors that affect the willingness of social work students to accept jobs in aging. Results of a hierarchical logistic regression indicate that age and personal/professional experiences with older people (but not gender, race, or educational level) significantly predicted willingness to accept jobs in aging.

AB- The article presents a cross-national study of social work students' interest in working with the elderly, based on a sample of 679 graduating BSW students from 7 countries: Australia, Brazil, England, Germany, Hungary, Israel, and the United States. The findings among all the national cohorts show that the motivation to work with the elderly was lower than motivation to work with any other age group and, moreover, that it was equally low in most of the countries. They indicate that low motivation to work with the elderly is not limited to 1 or 2 countries but exists in various parts of the globe. The findings support the growing concern that the social work profession may not be able to meet its obligations to the aging society.

AB- Michael Sheridan opens this section with a comprehensive review of the literature about the topic of religious and spiritually based interventions in social work. The knowledge base of social work has indeed come a long way from an earlier period when persons who reported intense but legitimate spiritual and religious experiences were frequently diagnosed as neurotic. CAT (complementary and alternative medicine) includes a wide range of approaches, including the use of natural products, yoga, postures, massage, meditation, and others with a spiritual dimension. The authors describe yoga in several forms and variations in the treatment of persons who are older and who are experiencing depression. Just as professional social workers are behind the learning curve in the acceptance of CAT approaches, so is social work education in exposing students to them. The authors advocate removing these practice and educational lags and suggest several ways to go about doing it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Evidence-based practice (EBP) has increasingly been put forth as a new paradigm of social work practice. One of the critical elements of EBP is the ability of consumers of research to be able to critically appraise research evidence. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the extent to which an introductory MSW research methods course affected student attitudes toward, and aptitude in, using research evidence. The study used a modified version of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme instrument developed in the health care profession. Findings indicated that students reported an improvement in subjective attitude toward research. However, there was no significant change in students' ability to critically appraise research evidence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social workers recognize the necessity of using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; American Psychiatric Association) but question its compatibility with social work education. The data in this study were compared with the data from P. R. Raffoul and K. A. Holmes (1986) regarding the extent to which the DSM was included in graduate social work programs. The authors' findings show that since 1986, schools have increased DSM content. Although educators continue to express concern about conflicts with the DSM, they also appreciate its usefulness in diagnosis and treatment planning, ft is recommended that DSM be taught in human behavior courses and that social workers have a stronger voice in the process of DSM revision.

AB- While recent research explores the determinants of homophobia among college students, only a few studies look at the perceptions of homosexuals among social work students. Unfortunately these rare studies generally present a modest list of predictor variables or small sample sizes. To address this gap, this research explores the ways in which undergraduate social work students (N = 748) from 12 colleges feel about homosexuality. In doing so, the work initially delineates the extent to which future social workers feel comfortable being around gay and lesbian persons. The work then explores the impact of specific social statuses, educational processes, and ideological beliefs. In the end, the role of homosexual peers is emphasized, as are the effects of familial attitudes, the perceived cause of homosexuality, conservative religious maxims, traditional gender role beliefs, and anxieties over AIDS.

AB- This exploratory quantitative study employs a 4-page Religion/Spirituality and Social Work Questionnaire that focuses on the beliefs and perceptions of 324 undergraduate social work students in 7 Council on Social Work Education-accredited schools of social work in the state of Texas about the role of religion and spirituality in social work practice and education. The vast majority of students in this sample (80.6%) are practicing Christians who have strong personal religious/spiritual beliefs and are relatively open to incorporating at least some religious/spiritual content into their practice with clients. More than 82% indicate that they want their social work courses to include content on religious/spiritual diversity, and 87.6% indicate interest in content on how to effectively deal with religious/spiritual issues in practice.

AB- This article discusses the Self and Other Awareness Project (SOAP) cultural competence development model and presents the results of a study that evaluated its impact on the racial attitudes of 110 undergraduate students enrolled in an undergraduate interdisciplinary Minority Groups course at a mid-sized public university in the Southeastern United States. Findings indicate that students experienced a statistically significant change in racial attitudes (measured by the Color-Blind Racial Attitudes Scale (Neville, Lilly, Duran, Lee, & Browne, 2000) from the beginning to the end of the course. Further analysis revealed that social work majors (n = 30) were significantly more aware of racial privilege and blatant racial issues at the end of the course than they were at the beginning of the course.

AB- Relative to other fields, social work has been slow to adopt geographic information systems (GIS) as a tool for research and practice. This paper argues that GIS can benefit social work by: (1) continuing and strengthening the social survey tradition; (2) providing a framework for understanding human behavior; (3) identifying community needs and assets; (4) improving the delivery of social services; and (5) empowering communities and traditionally disenfranchised groups. Examples from a social work course on GIS and published social work research help illustrate these points. The paper concludes by considering the ways that social work can contribute to the development of GIS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Little research exists on how self-disclosure is taught in social work education (Pianko, 2001). Few social work education programs include precontemplative components of exploring identity for gay male students. In this study, the data from 4 focus groups of gay male therapists, who discussed their self-disclosure, decision-making processes, were coded and analyzed. Data analysis revealed 3 topical areas: identity creation, preparatory identity management, and relational identity management. This article describes the intention and reflection model (IRM) of identity management in gay men as it relates to precontemplative identity of gay male students in social work education. The author also recommends potential research for IRM application to additional sociocultural populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Catholic social teaching provides a developed and consistent body of principles, based on solidarity with the full potential of every person. Love, the personal aspect of solidarity, is an indispensable relational quality. These principles, an external framework for action, are close to core social work values as well as to the values of many clients. They acknowledge both the context of the helping relationship and the consciences of the helper and the person helped. This could contribute to a thickening and deepening of our understanding of social work practice and the consequent "formation of the heart."

AB- Lavender Islands is the first strengths-based study of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) persons in New Zealand. In total, 2,269 LGB participants responded questions in many domains, including spirituality and religion. This study found that women are more likely to believe in a spiritual force than men, and respondents 40 years of age and older are more likely than younger to believe in a spiritual force. Respondents did not believe that partners needed to share beliefs. Christians reported that their religious tradition was more a difficulty than a support than those with no religion. LGBs appear to be disaffiliating with Christianity at 2.37 times the rate of the general New Zealand population since 1966. LGBs reporting no religion experienced more support from their families for themselves and their partners than those who were raised Christian. Religious traditions had no effect on the ages that respondents first felt different from their childhood peers, or when they actually came out. Respondents reporting no religion were significantly happier with their sexual identity than Christian respondents. Social workers should be aware of and address these conflicts and challenges with LGBs they encounter in their practice settings.

The purpose of this article is to challenge this assumption and in response, to put forth ways of assessing hope within the social worker's personal life and in educational and agency-based practice contexts. Implications for developing and nurturing professional hope through the use of the strengths perspective within social work education (i.e., using models that assert hope and client growth as normative) and within agencies (i.e., using inverted organizational hierarchies and group supervision) are discussed.

AB- Faith matters were crucial in the birth of the profession of social work. Despite present day social work curriculum rarely addressing faith matters, they are significant factors in the worldview of many clients and social workers. Faith matters can affect social work in nearly all areas of practice. The inclusion of faith matters into the social work curriculum can assist the profession in providing services that reflect principals concerning diversity and client-focused practice found in the NASW Code of Ethics. Ultimately, the integration of faith matters will allow for more multiculturally competent practice. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The majority of respondents regarded religion and spirituality as relevant to this population and used a wide variety of spiritually-based interventions. Respondents also reported a somewhat frequent identification of spiritual and religious abuse and neglect of youth. However, the vast majority reported that religious or spiritual issues were rarely, if ever, addressed in their social work education. Findings reveal the need to develop specific curricular content about the religious and spiritual lives of youth, including ethical guidelines for spiritually sensitive practice with this population.

AB- First, we examine several of the more prominent theoretical approaches in ethics (the utilitarian, absolute rule, principle based, and ethics of care approaches) and find the principle-based, common morality approach, and the ethics of care approach to be the two approaches that are most relevant to the types of ethical decisions practitioners characteristically are confronted with in a social work setting. We then propose combining these two approaches, taking into consideration the advantages and drawbacks of each, such that in application these two approaches can be seen to complement one another. We show in two brief hypothetical cases how the combined approach can be used to guide practitioners' ethical decision-making in real life situations.

AB- Do social workers' personal spiritual characteristics affect their conceptualizations of spirituality and religion? In light of growing professional interest in spirituality and religion, we attempt to answer this question using a mixed methods approach in conjunction with a nationally representative sample of NASW-affiliated graduate students (N = 303). The results suggest that respondents' faith tradition, orthodoxy, and degree of spiritual motivation have a relatively minor effect upon how they defined (1) spirituality, (2) religion, and (3) their understanding of the relationship between spirituality and religion. We conclude by discussing the implications of the findings and suggesting avenues for further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Some individuals living with disabilities have expressed a need to have spirituality recognized within clinical relationships. Social workers and other professionals have not responded to this need and therefore, there is a growing difference between what individuals with disabilities need and what clinicians, including social workers, are providing. Jean Vanier is a Canadian who has spiritual wisdom gained from over 40 years of living with people who have disabilities. Applying insights from both Vanier and transformational learning theory, this paper demonstrates that Vanier's approach is an important resource as social workers integrate spirituality into the clinical relationship with disabled individuals.

The findings are clustered around three primary themes-complementary (traditional) gender roles, distrust of outsiders, and the authority of religious leaders. Nine EC women and thirteen ultra OJ women were interviewed for this study, using a modified grounded-theory method. Based on the findings, guidelines for value-based practice with women from these communities are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The characteristics from this model are explored for their compatibility with spiritual practices. Written from a practitioner's experiences, case examples from various practice settings are given to exemplify application of spiritual or religious practices to development of the resiliency traits. Implications for practice include increased understanding of the use of spirituality as a tool to enhance adaptability and coping.

AB- In keeping with the profession's long history of addressing discrimination, this study explores perceptions of religious discrimination and ethical compliance among a national sample of professionally affiliated graduate students (N = 111). Relevant theory and research is reviewed, which provides a context for the study's exploration of (1) the degree to which respondents personally experience discrimination in their social work programs due to their religious beliefs (2) the extent to which respondents perceive religious discrimination is a problem in their educational programs and (3) respondents' perceptions of the profession's level of compliance with the six ethical standards that explicitly or implicitly address religion. The findings are presented and the implications are discussed as they intersect the social work profession and education in particular.

In turn, Chalmers developed Wilberforce's ideas into a complex evangelical Christian framework and charitable method encouraging all persons to redeem themselves by developing faith in Jesus Christ's expiation of their sins encouraging their performance of righteous activities or doing righteous activities endowing them with the Holy Spirit's grace and faith in Christ. Chalmers charitable method employed collocative processes of sequential problem-solving and caring activities between benefactors and recipients developing Christian and caring institutions, families and persons into harmonious communities. Loch and Richmond developed Chalmers charitable method into socially oriented charitable and social work methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

SU- Meditation; Religion; Social Casework; Spirituality
AB- The influences of Eastern thought on Western practices have emerged in areas of social work, health, religion, spirituality, even pop culture. This trend is apparent as individuals enroll in yoga classes, practice meditation, and listen to Eastern music mixed with Western lyrics. Globalization, which connects the Eastern and Western worlds, has a great impact on the Western way of life. One such impact in social work practice is meditation, defined as an "act of spiritual contemplation" (Perez-de-Albeniz & Holmes, 2000, p. 49). As exposure to Eastern practices increases, individuals in the West view meditation as a helping and problem solving process. This manuscript examines meditation and its migration from the Eastern world to Western social practices. The authors begin by comparing and contrasting religion and spirituality. The duality of Eastern and Western practice of meditation lies in these two constructs. The next section briefly touches upon the development of insight meditation within the philosophies of Hinduism and Buddhism. The authors then analyze how Baby Boomer and Generation X cohorts have influenced and encouraged the migration of meditation into Western society. Finally, the conclusion examines how meditation can be integrated into social work practice as a supplement to on-going talk therapy.

The authors undertook a qualitative research study comprised of individual interviews with 48 baalei teshuvah, two focus groups, and interviews with 10 key informants. From these data, the authors inductively derived a model of baalei teshvuvah's spiritual transformation over time. Seven non-linear processes are described-Spiritual Eclipse of the Soul, Spiritual Imprints, Existential Vacuum, Spiritual Reactivity, Spiritual Immersion, Movement toward Qedushah (Holiness), and Living the Commitment. Unique features of this model, similarities with other models, and implications for social work practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Empirical research has received very little focus in examining the presence of an association between social workers' spirituality and their commitment to social justice. This pilot study explores how a social worker's personal sense of spirituality may affect their professional practice of spirituality and their commitment to social justice. Other connections between social workers' personal and clinical use of spirituality and engagement in social change also emerged. In the course of semi-structured interviews with thirty social workers, findings from this study indicated that social workers' faith-affiliation takes the form of personal practice rather than involvement with organized religion. Most respondents valued the spiritual dimensions of their lives and respected the importance of spiritual dimensions for their clients. The study's findings suggest spirituality as a motivating factor in pursuing a social work career and participating in justice-seeking activities. The importance of further exploration of this association is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article conceptualizes an attachment-based model of the student-field instructor relationship, based on empirical research concerning internal working models of attachment, which continue into adulthood and serve as templates for life-long relating. Supportive relationships within a noncritical context are salient for effective supervision; attachment theory provides a framework for developing supportive supervisory relationships and augments existing theories of supervision. Ideal and problematic supervisory relationships are presented followed by recommendations for interventions and future research. The supervisory relationship will be most successful when the field instructor is guided by attachment theory and its conceptualization of a "secure base" (Bowlby, 1988).

AB- How do people define spirituality and religion and what, if any, relationship do they see between the 2 constructs? In this study, we answer these questions using a qualitative methodology with a nationally representative sample of graduate-level social work students affiliated with the National Association of Social Workers (N = 303). A relatively diverse array of definitions for both spirituality and religion emerged. Most respondents believed some form of relationship existed between spirituality and religion. A significant minority, however, reported that no or a minimal relationship existed between the 2 concepts. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings.

AB- This exploratory study describes social workers' perceptions of the depiction of the social work profession found in the news and entertainment media. A random sample of 665 MSW social workers who were members of the Florida Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers were surveyed regarding how they felt the profession was depicted in the news and entertainment media on a set of paired adjectives comprising 9 semantic differential scales. Findings showed that these social workers perceived the profession to be depicted negatively in both news and entertainment media. Implications for social work educators are discussed.

AB- At institutions of higher education across the United States, faculty have increasing opportunities to define their research and teaching activities as components of the evolving "scholarship of engagement" field. Using an "interpersonal relationship" framework outlined by Bringle and Hatcher (2002), this article presents some of the challenges inherent in this work from the viewpoint of two faculty members involved in a university-community partnership project. In addition, we suggest how this work can contribute to furthering our knowledge about these emerging collaborations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Eighteen experienced field instructors were asked to describe exemplary and problematic students, as well as student performance on 7 core dimensions. Themes that emerged revealed the importance that field instructors gave to a constellation of personal qualities and characteristics, a range of metacompetencies, as well as the procedural skills characteristic of competency-based evaluations.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted either in the 9th month (n = 5) or 2-12 months after delivery (n = 5). Content analysis revealed 6 main triggers, illustrated by excerpts, which stimulated field students' guilt feelings. Discussion of the results focused on the types of guilt described (omnipotent, separation, outdoing/survivor), manifestations of shame, and diverse possible explanations for the field students' guilt feelings, along with implications for social work supervision and practice.

AB- Identical vignettes except for a sentence describing a client's economic resources were randomly assigned to 129 MSW students. The vignettes described a social worker who agreed with a client's decision to relocate her residence as a partial solution to a presenting problem but did not assess or address economic barriers to the client's relocating. Students evaluating the "no economic resources" vignette were just as likely to agree that the social worker adequately assessed and addressed barriers to the client's relocating and to state that economic factors influenced their ratings as students who rated the "economic resources" vignette. The results provide little evidence that MSW students are sensitive to clients' economic circumstances. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Statistical analyses found MSW social workers with liberal arts undergraduate degrees more likely to prefer postconventional levels of moral reasoning, defined as greater complexity of thought and principled reasoning. The overall mean Defining Issues Test scores of 44.77 place the sample in maintaining-norms levels, i.e., authority-based moral reasoning. Ethics courses were found to be somewhat related to levels of moral reasoning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Self-perceived change scores were significantly higher for informal than formal CPE. Higher motivational orientation toward professional knowledge was found to be a stronger predictor of self-perceived change in KAB following participation in formal and informal CPE. In addition, following formal CPE, greater age and increased expectation to apply learning predicted greater perceived change in KAB. Implications for social work education are discussed.

AB- Employing a large-scale sample of 521 BSW students from 4 Israeli schools of social work, this research examines the factors affecting social work students' interest in working with a wide range of client groups. The results suggest that student interest in working with specific client groups is affected by factors related to desire for professional status, a reflection of social values, social work education, and work rewards and conditions. The greatest motivators in student interest in working with all the client groups examined were found to be (1) student perception of such work as contributing to one's professional growth and (2) aversion toward a client group. The limitations of the study and its implications for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The social work academic community is currently considering and critiquing the idea of evidence-based practice (EBP). Given the vital part that practicum education plays in the social work profession, understanding the views of field instructors on this subject is essential. The George Warren Brown School of Social Work at Washington University surveyed 283 field instructors within 180 agencies and found that the majority (87%, N = 235) viewed it as a useful practice idea. However, most of the indicators employed to assess use of scientific evidence in social work practice revealed that it occurs too infrequently. A lack of time was reported as the greatest obstacle.

AB- Despite questions about their reliability and validity, student evaluations of teaching (SETs) are a primary measure of instructor performance. The current study examines SETs, including a thorough list of potentially relevant variables. The findings suggest that how much students perceive they learned in a course is an important predictor of SET scores. Further, a number of variables outside of the instructor's control appear to introduce bias into SETs. Nonetheless, social work norms imply the necessity of seeking input from students. Suggestions are given for possible methods of dealing with this dilemma, and for needed future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article evaluates the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary social work and law curriculum for domestic violence. A pretest-posttest control group design with both law and social work students indicates that the course effectively increased: (1) knowledge about domestic violence theory and practice and differential roles, duties, and privileges of lawyers and social workers, and (2) positive attitudes about interdisciplinary work; and reduced (3) myths and stereotypes about domestic violence. Implications for interdisciplinary teaching and domestic violence services are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

T-test results suggest that students of trained field instructors were significantly more satisfied than students of those untrained with their field instructors' support and provision of specific, conceptually based feedback. Implications are discussed concerning the role of social work education programs in helping field instructors develop relevant educational skills.

Results from 6,987 students at entry and 3,451 students at graduation showed that students at graduation expressed stronger adherence to social work's traditional mission than they did at entry, but appeal of major social work client groups and practice areas decreased. Students of color maintained their strong initial desire to work with poor client groups between entry and graduation, while such desires decreased for Caucasian students, and American Indians showed the most stability of any group.

AB- This multi-sample study of master of social work students from various faith traditions (N = 391) explores the extent to which religious discrimination is perceived to exist as a problem in social work education programs. No difference in perceptions emerged between religiously affiliated and nonaffiliated respondents. Evangelical Christians generally reported higher levels of discrimination than theologically liberal and mainline Christians. The confirmation of the second hypothesis suggests that professional attention may be needed to ensure compliance with the profession's ethical and educational standards, while the failure of the first hypothesis suggests that progress toward a more inclusive educational environment may be occurring.

They argue that baccalaureate and master of social work courses need to routinely include more in-depth knowledge on psychopharmacology and provide a more critical social work-focused approach to this content due to the increasing complexity of social work practice, including a knowledge explosion in the neurosciences. Toward this end, 7 curriculum modules are proposed, including suggestions for class activities and assignments and application of module content to field courses.

AB- One can observe based on the reported studies in this volume that two conclusions have emerged. First, from a societal point of view, we have not invested nearly enough in assessing the effectiveness of faith-based social services. Second, our tentativeness about conclusive results notwithstanding, it seems safe to suggest that faith-based organizations as a whole are neither superior nor inferior to their secular counterparts. The studies in this volume did not find any indications of coerced or even implied proselytism. It seems that this is a small issue regarding the faith-based initiatives. In summary, this volume has started a new voyage. While the rhetoric about faith-based social services is rampant, actual empirical studies and discussion regarding the most appropriate topics and means of study are still long-term endeavors. It is possible that we will never know complete answers to our questions, but we are obliged to keep trying to rationalize the sphere of public service delivery with the use of tax-payer money.

AB- Using a grounded theory design and methods, 65 key informants in 15 faith-based organizations having promising programs in four urban areas were interviewed. Respondents were asked what makes their direct service programs faith-based. A story emerges, motivated by mission-driven visions tied to forces beyond local programs and steeped in deep traditions. A major implication of the findings is that in teaching people about the various practices of diverse religious groups, we are only giving them the visible elements. While the expressed values of acts and faith are integral in the faith-based discussion, they do not tell the full story. The deep drivers of human behavior and practice are found in the specific beliefs and interpretations of individuals who are involved either as leaders or participants in faith-based organizations. For many of these individuals in faith-based organizations, mission and accountability to God trumps secular or professional expectations.

AB- The policy debate over faith-based initiatives has prompted calls for comparative effectiveness research. Drawing examples from an evaluation of California's Community and Faith-based Initiative (CFBI), we illustrate a research strategy that takes local networks as the primary unit of analysis. This approach focuses on understanding the roles different organizations play within local service delivery networks, and on analyzing how local actors coordinate services to affect participant, organization, and system outcomes. The network perspective casts new light on policy options, and suggests that caution is necessary when using administrative data to interpret program effectiveness.

The arguments advanced are based on a group of comparative case studies conducted by the authors on secular and faith-based providers in three different social service domains: (1) transitional housing, (2) parent education, and (3) residential substance abuse treatment programs. All case studies utilized the same research protocol. The study identifies the lessons learned from comparative case study research on faith-based organizations when a similar protocol is implemented to examine a variety of social service domains and provider types.

AB- Community-based and faith-based programs are on-going partners in the social welfare mix which characterizes U.S. welfare provision. In the face of calls for more rigorous research on the capacity and impact of faith-based and community-based programs which use public funds, the research community must gain sophistication in addressing methodological issues inherent in participatory designs for the study of such programs. This article describes concerns which arose while implementing participatory research during a federally-funded, intensive 10-month long case study of a faith-based alternative education program for at risk youth. The project was funded through the Department of Health and Humans Services, Administration for Children and Family. The challenges to data collection are presented and suggestions for doing participatory research in similar settings are discussed.

AB- This essay first highlights three major challenges of measuring program effectiveness. It concludes effectiveness can best be conceptualized in terms of program outcomes and that such outcomes-while difficult to measure-can be measured with sufficient accuracy to justify the effort. These considerations are then illustrated by data gathered from 17 Los Angeles welfare-to-work programs and their clients in order to assess the comparative effectiveness of faith-based and secular programs. The essay concludes that no one type of welfare-to-work program was more effective across the board than any other type of program. Instead, the different types of programs seemed to be especially effective in certain specialized areas. The faith-based programs were especially effective in providing welfare recipients with emotional support and a sense of having a sympathetic, understanding base of support. The for-profit providers were especially effective in providing needed training in marketable job skills and help in finding employment. The essay concludes by discussing two public policy implications that flow from this type of program specialization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This paper reports on a project to investigate the implementation of charitable choice in TANF-funded job services in Indiana, Massachusetts, and North Carolina. A number of issues needed to be addressed in the course of the research project. State-level government responses to charitable choice were found to vary widely, making comparisons across states difficult. In Indiana, job training providers and clients were also interviewed. For providers, a major research issue was the assessment of the degree to which they were faith-based and the impact of this. To measure the impact of provider faith orientation on clients, a pre- and post-service study was designed. Providers were to administer the tests, but in many cases failed to do so correctly, thereby limiting the utility of the results. Finally, during the last year of the study, the state changed its funding priorities, thereby altering the provider system. A number of the providers changed their programs or stopped providing services, thereby dropping out of the delivery system. The paper considers the impact of these difficulties on the ability of research to make contributions to the discussion of charitable choice.

AB- Despite public policies that promote an increased role for faith-based organizations in the delivery of publicly supported services, insufficient attention has been paid to assessing how service delivery by faith-based and secular providers might differ. This study considers the issues involved in evaluating the role of faith-based organizations within the broad context of a community's social service offerings. Criteria are developed for assessing role differences by comparing the types of services, delivery approaches, and service locations offered by different types of providers. The approach is then illustrated using a large sample of social service providers in Los Angeles County. Important role differences are revealed. Faith-based organizations offer fewer and different types of services than their secular counterparts. The results suggest a modest and focused role for faith-based organizations in social service delivery, but one that is complementary to the efforts of secular providers. The methodological issues raised by such analyses are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The U.S. federal government, through Charitable Choice, has opened public funding for the delivery of social services to faith-based organizations (FBOs) more than ever before. This increased access to governmental funding at all levels has led to a closer examination of the evidence base on the effectiveness of the services provided by FBOs, and the capacity of FBOs to respond to data needs for accountability and program improvement efforts. This paper discusses the current status of evaluation research on FBO services and the emerging data needs among faith-based providers. Promising avenues for enhancing the current understanding of outcomes of FBO services are explored such as (1) adopting outcome measurement practices in use within the current nonprofit sector, and (2) developing more rigorous research designs tailored to the special contexts of faith-based services. The paper suggests an agenda in which FBO operators, funders, and evaluators work together to move forward in improving the evidence base on faith-based services.

AB- Development of accountability standards to demonstrate cause and effect relationships are gaining rapid advancement in the field of social sciences. Many governmental agencies, foundations, and other funders have developed approaches that require organizations to utilize science-based programs and incorporate evaluative methods to show improved outcomes and cost benefits to society. This article will examine the need for increased accountability in developing effective interventions by faith-based organizations in the delivery of social service interventions. Recently, there has been a strong movement toward governmental funding for faith-based institutions to provide social services, although there has been inadequate scientific data to demonstrate that approaches implemented are effective in meeting needs or yielding favorable outcomes. Similarly, many faith-based organizations provide innovative and effective programs that could serve as model programs if there was appropriate empirical evidence. This article will discuss how rigorous evaluative approaches such as randomized clinical control trials can produce scientific data on program effectiveness. We will use a case example in the field of drug and alcohol treatment to illustrate these points. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- After some decades of being subject to neglect or contempt, faith-based social care programs are receiving increased attention and resources enabling them to undertake a greater role in the national network of human services. Faith-based programs receiving public support can expect to be rightly scrutinized by the public, in terms of their ability to attain professed program goals. The tools of conventional empirically-oriented program evaluation research have tremendous potential to help demonstrate the effectiveness of faith-based programs, which will justify their receipt of ongoing support from public funds. Negative research findings can be properly scrutinized by the faith-based community of service providers to help make tough, data-based, decisions on funding priorities. Several examples are described, illustrating how various types of faith-based programs have profitably participated in program evaluation studies.

AB- Faith-based provision and reception of social services may yield results that differ either randomly or persistently (via "fixed effects") from the outcomes achieved under non-faith-based, but certainly not value-free, administration of these services. Yet attributing raw differences in performance to unobservable factors assumed to derive from "faith" should be a last resort. Instead, the objective of analysis should be to identify any such factors and their cost and strength operationally so that they can become a managed part of any program offered by existing providers or entrants. These factors, or the cost effectiveness of employing them, could differ between secular and faith-based providers. Then members of the two groups optimally would use a different mix of means even if they were to pursue precisely the same ends. Yet program design and operation by both groups would stand to benefit from knowing the keys to their relative performance in particular areas of social service with particular groups of clients. Comparing the outcomes of experiments based on random assignment may provide little help in that regard. Micro-simulations may provide a superior approach to tightening the link between input-based model predictions and continuous learning from outcomes.

AB- The need to assess the effectiveness of faith-based social interventions is pressing. On the one hand, politicians and pundits claim that faith-based organizations are impressively successful and inexpensive. On the other hand, critics claim that faith-based organizations lack the capacity to carry out social services. However, rigorously-collected empirical data is just beginning to appear and is still in short supply, particularly congregations. In this paper, we discuss some critical methodological and conceptual problems that arise from years of academic neglect of faith-based social service provision. We demonstrate how our attempt to create a comprehensive account of congregation-based social services in Philadelphia necessitated defining even such basic terms as "congregation" and devising novel methods for identifying and gathering information from congregations.

It discusses the paucity of such attempts and the complications involved in measuring effectiveness of social programs, especially when religion is involved. It then reviews the contributions provided in this volume and draws conclusions for future studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This exploratory qualitative study investigated the learning process in field education from the perspective of two major stakeholder groups. Field instructors (n=80) and students (n=100) participated in an experiential exercise (Jarvis, 1987) that used Kolb's Learning Cycle as a basis to explore and expand upon their perceptions of how this learning occurs. Data consisted of modifications participants made to Kolb's model. Findings suggest key elements of experiential learning operative in field education are missing from Kolb's model, in particular the role of relationship. Further research is needed to develop a model more reflective of the learning process in field education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- For this study, 188 students from 4 social work programs completed a questionnaire about their motivation and performance in field practicum. Achievement motivation included task value, intrinsic motivation, perception of task difficulty, confidence, and self-efficacy. Students were more satisfied with field education and rated their social work skills higher if they valued what they learned in field (task value), took pleasure in field activities (intrinsic motivation) and had a greater sense of self-efficacy about field tasks. However, achievement motivation was unrelated to field instructor evaluation of student skills. Discussion includes suggestions for increasing student achievement motivation.

The majority believed that a written agreement is helpful before beginning research to decide authorship order.

This study seeks to shed light on the need to engage in empirical investigations concerning cultural competence and school social work practice. Findings from this study highlight the need for both social work education programs and postgraduate professional development programs to monitor practitioners' preparation for culturally competent practice in urban public school systems.

The pervasive discomfort and silence surrounding lesbian and bisexual issues, as well as the privileging of heterosexuality experienced by these women, are presented as being reflective of the contextual settings of these programs. Furthermore, factors including the location and structure of, and the presence of other gay, lesbian, or bisexually identified people within these programs, are discussed as mitigating the heteronormativity experienced by these women.

AB- Based on data from a survey of 121 baccalaureate and master of social work students at a western university, this study explores students' perspectives of "safe" and "unsafe" classroom environments. The majority reported that being in a safe classroom changed both what and how much they learned. Students offered a wide range of instructor, fellow student, personal, and classroom characteristics that contribute to the creation of safe and unsafe spaces. Responses about such characteristics were relatively consistent across genders, race (measured as being White or of color), and program level. Implications for social work education and research are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Drawing from stress and coping theory, the authors discuss the relevance of assessing appraisals and emotional responses within the context of environmental and individual risk and protective factors. Through an illustrative case assessment, the authors describe the contextualized assessment process and its ramifications for strategic safety planning.

The study used a Job Analysis Questionnaire developed specifically for this study. Results indicated differences among the three groups. Implications call for more attention and tighter follow-up of teachers on student field work and greater clarity on expected and actual performance of roles as perceived by teachers, field instructors, and students.

AB- Professional interest in spirituality and religion is growing. In light of this growth, the ethical standards designed to guide social workers' conduct in the area of religion have never been more important. This article explores perceptions of compliance with the profession's ethical standards that address religion among a sample of graduate students (N=303) affiliated with the National Association of Social Workers. Findings indicated relatively high levels of compliance. These perceptions were independent of a number of demographic, spiritual, and religious variables. Implications for social work education and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article offers a multidimensional framework that broadens current approaches to "best practices" inquiry to include (1) the perspectives of both the consumers of services and professional practitioners and (2) a value-based critique. The predominant empirical approach to best practices inquiry is a necessary, but not sufficient, component of seeking state-of-the-art knowledge. A best practices inquiry is improved when it is broadened to include experiences and preferences of consumers, the wisdom of professionals in a given field, and a critical appraisal of the values inherent in best practices interventions themselves. Implications for social work education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- The standards of the National Association of Social Workers (2001) for culturally competent practice and the Council on Social Work Education's (2001) accreditation standards require monitoring and evaluation of the multicultural competencies of students and professional social workers. The absence of assessment instruments impedes feedback about compliance and the effectiveness of multicultural practice. Results of the present study support the use of 2 self-report subscales of the Multicultural Competence Inventory (MCI) for evaluating worker self-perceptions of competency. The MCI will also help provide empirical feed-back about students' views of their own progress, particularly within programs emphasizing social justice and diversity.

AB- This study used a classical pretest-posttest control group design to measure changes in participants' responses after a 45-minute seminar provided 48 undergraduate social work students with techniques on how to better handle stressful situations. When compared to the control group, responses from the students who received the seminar showed significant changes, and these students reported levels of stress and apprehension that were significantly lowered. These findings suggest that formal efforts are important for short-term assistance to help students cope with stress encountered during the course of their studies. Recommendations for future research and intervention in this area are made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Increasing demands that social work be a profession committed to evidence-based practice have coincided with innovations in information technology, which potentially give social workers unprecedented access to a plethora of sources and types of evidence. Because these innovations can enable access to evidence beyond traditional boundaries, the question of how we establish the borders of acceptability warrants consideration. This article explores the range of boundaries that contemporary social workers may encounter as they attempt to negotiate the demands of evidence-based practice. Recommendations for a critical, but not insular, approach to selecting evidence bases for social work interventions are provided.

The study examined the relationships between a dependent variable--level of moral development--and two independent variables--history of domestic violence and relationship status (separated or joined). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed no significant differences between the moral development of battered and non-battered women. Implications for social work education are discussed and strategies for infusing content on domestic violence are provided.

Older students, those who had taken even one social work class prior to entering their practicum, and those with more than a year of work or volunteer experience in social services reported significantly less anxiety about beginning practicum than their colleagues. Implications and recommendations for social work admissions criteria, course curriculum content, field education initiatives, and future research in this area are discussed.

AB- An earlier end-of-year survey of 52 field instructors revealed gaps in the ability of instructors to directly address cultural concerns with student supervisees (Bain & Garcia, 1999). For this study, a transferable model of diversity training was piloted with 11 field instructors that targeted their behavior in 3 domains--relationship with self, the supervisee, and the agency. Results from a questionnaire administered at 3 different points--pre-training, post-training, and 6-month follow-up--revealed fewer avoidant behaviors with students over time.

AB- The purpose of this study was to further understanding of group supervision in field education. The goal was to illuminate factors that students identified as important for a group climate that facilitated learning. A qualitative interview methodology was used to explore the experiences of 18 MSW students who received group supervision as the primary method of field instruction. Numerous factors influence students' ability to participate in group learning, such as their previous experiences with each other, level of competence, and skill as a group member. The respondents also described specific behaviors of the field instructor as group supervisor that they valued. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

This study reports the results of a full survey (N=446) of all accredited social work education programs. Findings include the number of programs placing students internationally, the number of students placed, the countries into which they are placed, whether these students are graduates or undergraduates, and whether these international placements represent an ongoing commitment by the programs. Several factors are examined which are hypothesized to affect a program's willingness to place students internationally.

AB- Educators have traditionally taught ethics by using models of ethical reasoning, which assume that ethical reasoning skills are sufficient tools for helping social workers to effectively voice clients' and patients' needs in diverse settings. Using hospitals as an example, the authors argue that contextual barriers often prevent social workers from ensuring that patients' and clients' perspectives are adequately represented in ethical deliberations. The authors propose that educators also teach students strategies for how to engage in effective ethical advocacy. Specific strategies that educators can incorporate into course discussions are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social work education programs often rely on adjunct or contract instructors to teach a portion of their curriculum. Such teachers can supplement full-time faculty who are unavailable, and they can be used to bolster segments of the curriculum that would benefit from their specialized practice knowledge and skills. This article describes the critical elements of an existing training program designed to systematically prepare contract faculty for teaching responsibilities in social work education programs. This program can be used as a model by social work education programs in preparing and integrating this crucial segment of the instructional workforce.

In this conceptual article, the author argues for the informed use of self-efficacy theory as one pragmatic guide for the design of teaching methods uniquely suited to social work practice. Research concerning the known sources of self-efficacy is reviewed and recommendations for how this research can be applied in social work education is presented. The strengths and limitations of self-efficacy theory in the context of social work perspectives and values are also discussed.

Ten field instructors independently divided 20 student vignettes into as many categories as necessary to reflect various levels of student performance, described their categories, and ranked the individual vignettes within each category. The independently generated categories and their descriptions were very similar across instructors, and the inter-rater reliability was very high both for the placement of vignettes into categories (0.77) and the rankings (0.83).

Findings from a survey that asked 61 field instructors about their experiences with such students and their knowledge of ADA guidelines provide additional information for policy development. Based on the survey and the legal guidelines, the authors present a problem-solving framework and recommendations to guide academic programs toward an approach that protects the rights of all parties involved.

The PBL program has three components: paper cases, skills workshops, and field project. Its aim is to help students integrate social work theories with practice and build their competence in self-directed learning. Findings on the preliminary assessment of the students' learning are reported. The experience was generally positive. The tutors' opinions of how the PBL program can fit in a social work curriculum and contribute to student learning are included, and the author describes the types of support required for model implementation.

AB- There is a recognized shortage of persons who have both a doctorate and a professional degree (BSW or MSW) from a program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). This survey identifies numerous strategies that programs are using or are contemplating using to address the shortage of candidates who have both a doctorate and a professional social work degree. These strategies include (a) significantly increasing the amount of money offered to someone with both a doctoral degree and a professional degree from a CSWE-accredited program; (b) limiting hiring to only people with a MSW degree; and (c) making a policy change in the last 5 years to recognize the MSW as a terminal degree for hiring purposes. Finally, the survey provides hard data that social work programs can present to campus administrators to illustrate the need to either (a) make more attractive offers to candidates for positions, or (b) make policy changes that will be more attractive to candidates such as recognizing the MSW degree as a terminal degree for hiring and reappointment decisions. There currently is a shortage in the United States of persons who have both a doctorate and a professional social work degree. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This article provides a framework for using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to help social work field instructors work effectively with students of a variety of personality types. The article describes the MBTI and includes strategies for using it to assess students' needs, determine issues in supervisory style, and enhance supervisor-student relationships. Within the framework are strategies for respecting and responding to type differences and for learning to act against preference to work effectively with students of different types. The authors emphasize the ethical use of the MBTI in field instruction and limitations of its use. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Three specific areas are considered for each of these ethno-cultural groups: (a) diverse perceptions of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia; (b) barriers to service utilization; and (c) caregiving responsibilities. Finally, suggestions are offered for the use of this information in the classroom, which may better prepare future practitioners for competent practice with minority elders with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

AB- The purpose of this article is to present and characterize the empirical literature that relates to the professional socialization of social work students and then contrast it with some of the early medical and nursing studies in this area. This article argues that unlike the professional socialization studies in medicine, nursing, and other disciplines, which benefit from the findings of qualitative, exploratory research, social work frequently reduces the study of a complex process to attitude and value dimensions, without empirical agreement on what those dimensions are or how to best measure them. The prevailing structural functionalist stance adopted by social work researchers excludes a broader framework by which socializing forces and their interplay could be discovered and identified. Implications and recommendations for social work education are noted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

The package consists of 6 instruments for student, graduate, and employer feedback and addresses questions related to program processes and curriculum. The BEAP objectives include assisting baccalaureate social work programs with meeting accreditation assessment standards and providing a national database for comparative purposes. In 2001, approximately 30% of baccalaureate programs nationwide were using the package. A review of assessment literature is provided, and the package is evaluated using a checklist of characteristics of good assessment.

Although use of that term has referred primarily to practice with ethnic and racial minorities, the concept has been broadened to include social work with other culturally diverse populations. This article examines the application of cultural competence principles to practice with gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered clients. Attitude, knowledge, and skill components are addressed to delineate a culturally competent approach to social work with sexual minorities. Implications for practice, education, and the profession are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

In-depth interviews with 30 lesbian and gay social work students and graduates revealed 11 categories of sexual-orientation related issues that they confronted in field placements, including heterosexist and homophobic attitudes and behaviors, unwelcoming agency climates, and challenges related to disclosure of sexual orientation in the agency. Participants also suggested resources that might improve the field placement experience. The implications of the findings for social work students, academic programs, and placement agencies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Secondary data analysis of a California statewide sample of nearly 7,000 entering MSW students between 1991 and 1999 sought to find out whether MSW students are less motivated by social work's traditional mission of serving the poor and whether students of color are more motivated than Caucasian students by this mission. Results indicate that (1) MSW students are highly attracted to clinical practice but are simultaneously attracted to traditional, non-clinical domains of social work; and (2) they are least attracted to private practice and psychotherapy relative to other areas of social work. MSW students of color and Caucasian students are also generally more alike than different in professional philosophy; however, students of color, especially American Indians, express views more consistent with social work's traditional mission.

AB- This article presents findings from a study of 3 professional groups most frequently involved in child maltreatment cases: child protection social workers, district attorney social workers, and police detectives. The survey instrument examined the identification and concordance level of domestic violence indicators. Analysis of the research findings suggest varying differences across the 3 groups surveyed. The author discusses the importance of social work education in training professionals on domestic violence theories and assessment tools, and developing systems to assess for and address domestic violence issues, multidisciplinary approaches, and ethical practices for sharing client information.

AB- Because domestic violence is a serious threat to women's lives and well-being, social workers are encouraged to screen, assess, and implement intervention. National Association of Social Workers members from Florida were surveyed in order to understand their screening barriers and behaviors. Participants with more Continuing Education Units, agency inservice hours, and additional training perceived fewer barriers to screening, screened more, and identified more domestic violence victims. Multiple regression analysis showed that perceived self-efficacy, paperwork screening reminders, and inservice training hours explained 38.5% (35.8% adjusted) of the variability in screening behaviors. Screening is an important component in the process of helping battered women. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study determines which Web-assisted teaching strategies social work students from a single university experience and perceive as valuable. The results demonstrate that most faculty use email, post grades online, and give out student email addresses to the class. Students perceive email communication with the instructor and the online provision of course information as the most valuable strategies. The impact of several student characteristics on value perception is also examined, revealing varying levels of influence. These findings suggest that the strategies students report as the most valuable are not necessarily the strategies most frequently used by faculty.

AB- This study of 285 BSW students over a 4-year period examines the students' initial attitudes toward learning research and identifies associated characteristics. In contrast to social work students' reputation of being "research reluctant," findings reveal considerable variation, with a large portion of students reporting overall positive attitudes. Ordinary least squares regressions revealed that women and students with less statistical knowledge are more fearful of research courses, while older students and those with greater levels of social work empowerment find research courses to be more appealing. The study findings suggest 3 pedagogical principles upon which various teaching strategies may be based. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- A sample of 71 psychopathology course syllabi from 58 different graduate schools of social work was analyzed to determine whether different viewpoints and the concomitant empirical evidence were presented regarding 4 significant mental health topics: concepts of mental disorder, reliability and validity of psychiatric diagnoses, biological etiology, and drug treatment. There is little evidence that graduate psychopathology courses cover viewpoints other than the most conventional and institutional--that of biomedical psychiatry. A small handful of secondary (textbooks) rather than primary (research articles) sources provide the majority of the mental health content in these courses. Implications are discussed. The article includes an overview of both the relevant conventional and critical literature. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

This is the source of the psychiatrist's traditional social obligation to control "harm to self and/or others/" that is, suicide and crime. The ethical dilemmas of psychiatry cannot be resolved as long as the contradictory functions of healing persons and protecting society are united in a single discipline.

AB- This article presents findings of a phenomenological study exploring how gender roles of social work students are affected through the process of intervention with battered women. We suggest that such intervention continuously challenges the worker to reexamine identity-related topics. The study was done through in-depth semistructured interviews conducted with 20 Israeli female undergraduate students, both Jewish and Arab. Their narratives revealed how encounters with battered women shape their experiences in domains such as family of origin, current intimate relationships, and gender attitudes. The meanings of the transformed narratives for the students are discussed along with implications for social work supervision and practice.

AB- This article presents an analysis of disability theory and content in the social work curriculum and advances a theoretically expansive approach to disability that is consistent with social work's commitment to diversity and the elimination of oppression. A careful examination of relevant social work literature reveals that disability is generally discussed and treated from a diagnostic perspective. We suggest shifting the approach to disability content in social work curricula from one that emphasizes individual deficiency to one that addresses disability as the interaction of a medical condition or diverse conditions with disabling environments.

AB- Tested an instrument for scoring social work school applicants' personal statements and evaluated its effectiveness measured against field outcomes of admitted students. The sample was composed of 119 applicants to a Masters degree program in social work. Raters were 12 full-time faculty of the institution to which applicants were applying. Inter-rater reliability of the instrument was below .70, the lower bound of recommended reliability, suggesting that it did not promote consistent ratings among paired raters. Field outcomes were not found to be highly correlated with personal statement scores or with undergraduate GPA. Undergraduate GPA was found to be positively related to graduate GPA. Implications for specifying valid and reliable suitability criteria and for using personal statements in admissions decisions are explored.

AB- Implemented a model for assessing student ability and setting goals for ongoing learning in the social work field practicum. The model is based on a structured system of self-appraisal and has 2 main purposes: evaluating competencies and defining goals for the second half of placement. Thirty-seven social work graduate students completed a mid-term self evaluation for their first field practicum in which they selected 10 goals and ranked their progress toward achieving the goals. Field instructors provided independent ratings. Students and instructors then discussed their rankings in order to plan priorities for the 2nd half of the field placement. Correlations between student and instructor rankings were calculated. Results indicated that a low correlations between student and instructur rankings was associated with having difficulty in a placement, suggesting that this model may be a valuable tool for highlighting problems at the mid-term of the practicum and ensuring that they do not remain hidden until the end.

The author argues that the underdevelopment of this perspective is responsible, in part, for the dominance of gender, racial, and ethnic theories that classify persons according to their anatomic and cultural attributes, and have led to a focus on the multicultural education and cultural competency in the caring professions. The author articulates propositions central to the human-centric perspective and highlights universal human attributes upon which a human-centric perspective could be developed further.

AB- The author contributes his views to the debate between Bruce Thyer and Tomi Gomory in the Winter 2001 issue of this journal on improving the knowledge base of social work practice. His aim is to reference the major philosophy texts and to focus on drawing out more of the practical implications for social work. Both authors (Thyer and Gomory) agree on the need for more research evaluating the effectiveness of social work interventions in order to improve services to users. There are implications for evidence-based practice that we can draw out of these philosophical debates. First, they reveal the impossibility of adopting a neutral stance in theorizing. Second, people inevitably have some assumptions as they try to make sense of the world, to understand the causes of human behavior, or to look for ways of changing behavior. Third, instead of pretending to be value or theory-free, we should rather try to make explicit the base from which we are approaching social work practice. Most social problems are thought to have multiple causes. Deciding which one to tackle is partly guided by knowledge of what works but is also strongly influenced by economic and resource issues and moral or political judgements about where, in the system, change should occur.

AB- The bifurcated structure of social work education, micro and macro, is often unwarranted and restrictive. This split forces a premature and unnecessarily narrow focus in study and practice. In order to adequately pursue social justice and deal with issues of power and oppression in a clinical context, this bifurcated structure of social work must somehow be unified. A narrative-deconstructive model of practice, nested in the postmodern-poststructuralist paradigm and embodied in the work of White and Epston offers a resolution to this dilemma. The authors provide a conceptual base for understanding this model, highlight those socio-political elements of the model that integrate clinical practice with social change, present examples, and discuss implications for social work education.

AB- Increasing numbers of social work training programs are offering international field practicum placements. However, because it is difficult to provide appropriate, high quality supervision that is needed over large distances, many educators and researchers are calling for the greater use of Internet-based videoconferencing to deliver remote supervision. This article examines current ethical guidelines affecting the use of videoconferencing in the supervision of students nationally and internationally. The authors suggest protocols to address ethical and professional practice issues that are likely to arise as a result of using videoconferencing to conduct supervision across international borders.

AB- This study reports on the results of a survey of 378 MSW students (aged 20-58 yrs) that asked about their attitudes regarding the efficacy and the ethics of online psychotherapeutic services (e-therapy). The students' perceptions varied considerably, but there was a moderately strong association between the belief that the ethical requirements of practice can be met online and positive attitudes about the efficacy of e-therapy. Students had little direct experience with e-therapy and generally did not discuss the issue in practice classes. Implications for social work education are discussed and suggestions are made for incorporating e-therapy content into the practice curriculum.

AB- This study examines the reliability and validity of a measure to evaluate student field performance. Results demonstrated a consistent factor structure with excellent internal consistency, however, there was inadequate consistency between ratings of individual students in their first and second field education experiences. The measure had some predictive validity in that it could differentiate between students identified as having difficulty in Year 1 of the program, but not in Year 2. Scores were significantly associated with academic grades. Implications for future instrument development and the process of evaluation are considered.

AB- According to the author's theory, education is a process of evolution or growth--intellectual and social growth. The task of the teacher is to promote or facilitate such growth. The author believes that social workers are in a business not unlike that of teachers--promoting the growth of their clients. This theory construes the role of the teacher quite differently: the teacher imparts nothing to the students. With this theory that the primary role of the teacher is that of a critic: someone who supplies critical feedback to the students to help them uncover the inadequacies in their present knowledge and to help them recognize and accept their errors and mistakes so that they can eliminate them. The teacher can do this by creating a classroom environment wherein this can take place--an educative environment. An educative environment has three aspects: It is free. It is responsive. It is supportive. Social workers, like educators, seek to promote the growth of their clients--the growth or improvement of their clients' conduct. This takes place, the author suggests, through the modification of existing conduct. The creation of a free, responsive, and supportive environment is a matter of practical intelligence that comes only with concrete experience and practice in the field.

AB- In a telephone survey 18 new social work educators responded to questions about their perceptions of mentoring in their first years as faculty members. Results indicate that new social work faculty believe mentoring relationships provide them with multiple benefits, including improved teaching and research performance. Data also suggest that programs must be carefully developed and supported if protégés, mentors, and their organizations are to fully realize these benefits. Factors such as mentor-protégé matching, mentor characteristics, the roles of mentors, organizational support, and the mentoring process must be considered if a successful mentoring program is to be implemented.

AB- A survey was sent to 163 MSW programs in the United States and Canada that asked directors of fieldwork to respond to questions related to their school's policies on disclosure of student status in the field. With a response rate of 66.3% (N=108), most of the schools (68.5%, n=74) reported policies requiring disclosure and most directors supported this position. The authors review the ethical and legal reasons in favor of disclosure. They strongly suggest that a pro-disclosure policy be written and adopted by social work programs and the discipline's professional organizations.

A purposive sample of 52 social work professionals and 82 social work students was selected to participate in a survey that used a two-item closed-ended and five-item open-ended questionnaire. Despite the study limitation imposed by self-selection of the sample, the findings help to define and conceptualize social work entrepreneurship. The author makes a case for including entrepreneurial training in the social work curriculum. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

Findings show that a small minority (6.5%, n=184) of the 2,837 respondents expressed intolerant attitudes and that predictors of acceptance included religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, and academic degree sought by the student. Attitudes for which at least 15% of the sample expressed negativity are identified and used to suggest teaching strategies that not only help students accept gay and lesbian clients, but also provide further education for practice with this population.

AB- This article presents data from an exploratory study on class participation and student self-censorship. The impetus for this research is concern that content on multiculturalism and oppression inhibits open debate and dialogue, a form of suppression that conservatives term "political correctness." Through survey and focus group data, the authors examine student discomfort in social work courses, reasons for self-censorship, and solutions to self-censorship. Results suggest that general classroom factors (being too shy or being unprepared), not political correctness, were more likely to be reasons for self-censorship. Solutions focused on the faculty's role in creating safe and affirming classroom environments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- Social work authors have presented superficial appraisals of atypical neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs used to treat schizophrenia. This article presents a critical overview of clinical trials and research strategies involving conventional and atypical drugs. It identifies 14 distinct methodological and conceptual failings and neglected research directions. These flaws raise serious doubts about the scientific justifications for the widespread use of neuroleptics. Implications for a critical social work education stance about psychopharmacology are discussed. Findings from psychopharmacotherapy studies cannot be taken at face value: social work educators must scrutinize the adherence of the research enterprise to the scientific method and situate its findings in their historical, ideological, and political-economic contexts.

AB- Feagin's Poverty Scale was used to measure social work students' and non-social work students' perceptions of the causes of poverty. Present social work students, like previous ones, attribute poverty more to structural factors than individual factors. Further analysis, however, suggests that this may only be true for female and white social work students. Male and nonwhite social work students appear to attribute poverty to both structural and individual factors. White social work students perceive structural factors as more important in causing poverty than white non-social work students. Non-social work students did not overwhelmingly attribute poverty to individualistic factors as expected. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This article measures the efficacy of two approaches to teaching students to assess clients for substance abuse: an alcohol and other drug (AOD) minor program and integration of AOD content into core courses. A quasi-experimental design involved nonrandom assignment to an AOD minors program or to a nonminors curriculum. Both groups reported on their usual AOD assessment and on AOD assessment in their first interview with their most recent client. Self-report outcomes, examined in relation to the number of courses with integrated AOD content taken, suggest that these courses lead to significantly more self-reported assessment for substance abuse.

AB- What activities are associated with MSW students' performance in the field, perceptions of the quality of field instruction, and satisfaction with the field? Sixty-four MSW students reported on observational-participatory and conceptual linkage learning activities used in their first- and second-year placements. Greater use of some activities was associated with satisfaction and perception of quality but not with field instructors' ratings of student performance. This study highlights the importance to students of both doing and understanding, and suggests the need to distinguish student perceptions from performance.

AB- This article proposes that social workers can conduct effective child intervention through the application of a developmental cognitive and social approach that highlights common ground between all mental health professionals, regardless of theoretical orientation. By presenting a model of the psychotherapeutic process, the author calls attention to shared interdisciplinary modes of inquiry into individual child development. This model is intended to assist clinical social workers in identifying these basic shared assumptions in order to improve the outcomes of the therapeutic process during the referral, assessment, intervention, and evaluation stages.

AB- For this article, the Hudson and Ricketts Index of Attitudes toward Homosexuality (IAH) was used to measure levels of homophobia in a convenience sample of 124 students enrolled in social work programs in two major universities in the Republic of South Korea. The results indicated that BSW and MSW Korean students had high levels of homophobia, particularly in comparison to U.S. samples. In-class discussion of homosexuality was found to be significantly associated with lower levels of homophobia. The authors review these and other research findings and discuss implications for social work education in South Korea and the United States.

AB- Data was collected biannually (1992-98) from a complete population of students entering and exiting accredited graduate programs of social work in California (N=5,793). Findings suggest that practice interests and career aspirations of MSW students are more diverse and dynamic in nature than the debate in the literature on social work's mission would lead readers to believe. Although the proportion of all students most interested in each of the seven practice areas studied does not change throughout graduate studies, there is tremendous movement among individual students with respect to practice preferences during the course of their education.

Students responded to a variety of questions pertaining to the supervisory assignments and activities of their field instructor. The author discusses the relationship between supervisory skills and students' perceptions of enhanced learning. Early in the practicum, activities reported as most helpful to students were those that introduced them to the agency and clarified expectations of their performance. At the end of their experience, students perceived as most helpful those activities which helped them to be self-critical and to link classroom and field learning.

AB- Although research teaching literature suggests that social work students may have different research learning attributes than students in other disciplines, minimal data exist to support this view. This study compared the self-reported research anxiety, computer anxiety, and research orientations of 149 full-time graduate social work, psychology, and business students at a research university. Social work students reported more research and computer anxiety and generally believed that research was less important to their profession than students in the comparison groups. Implications for teaching research to social work graduate students are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)

AB- This study was designed to explore how organizational life in university-affiliated graduate social work education programs in the United States is affected by the stress of heightened caregiving roles. Analysis of data from 69 schools demonstrated deleterious effects of caregiving stress on organizational effectiveness, including missed obligations, feeling overwhelmed, and distracting others by seeking social support for specific problems. The authors identify two variables that provided partial amelioration of caregiver stress and appeared to contribute to increased organizational effectiveness: larger faculty size and on-site child care.

AB- Dual relationships between social work educators and their current or former students is largely unstudied. This article reports on a survey of deans and senior social work educators' ethical beliefs on dual relationships. Educators were asked how they regarded different types of dual relationships and differences between dual relationships with current and former students. They were also asked about ethics education in their schools. Beliefs about dual relationships varied, especially regarding current students and former ones. While ethics education in schools of social work is extensive, policies on dual relationships are scarce. Further research is needed on the ethics of dual relationships in social work education.

AB- The authors report on an investigation of the correlation between admissions criteria and academic performance at one state university. The admissions data used in this study were collected from 654 MSW students (aged 21–65 yrs) who attended the school from 1985 to 1992. Test scores on a comprehensive exam taken by these MSW students prior to graduation were used as the measure of academic performance. The authors found that two admissions criteria, undergraduate GPA and GRE score, and two applicant characteristics, gender and race, were significantly correlated with academic performance.

AB- For this exploratory study of the educational orientations of graduate social work faculty, the author surveyed faculty in 38 randomly selected graduate social work departments in the United States in Spring 1991. All were sent a revised Hadley Educational Orientation Questionnaire, which measured their agreement with 12 items each on Mentoring Orientation and Master Teaching Orientation scales. The survey also asked about the source of their educational philosophies. Analysis of 346 responses suggests that faculty tend toward a master teaching approach in attempting to impart essential knowledge and to empower students, but they also incorporate elements from the mentoring approach. Faculty indicated that their educational philosophies were derived principally from work experiences, personal experiences, and professional socialization.

SU- Occupational Status; Professional Development; Scientific Communication
AB- In recent years publication has become the central criterion in the appointment, promotion, and tenure of graduate faculty. Because normative data about publication effort and success have not been available to guide faculty personnel decisions, the author investigated variation in manuscript submission and acceptance, both within and across academic rank, among 509 faculty of 45 social work graduate programs. The results suggest that although faculty of all ranks made regular efforts to publish and achieved considerable success, higher academic rank was negatively associated with the frequency of manuscript submissions and positively associated with manuscript acceptance. The author concludes that the consistency of these empirical relationships in the cross-sectional data might evidence adherence to a traditional, academic model of publication within the schools where these faculty teach.

AB- This article elaborates a cultural framework for viewing alcohol and drug abuse which, if used as a teaching tool, can lead to increased cultural awareness among students. The framework helps educators to illustrate the powerful role of culture in shaping behaviors such as drinking and drug use and to focus on several cultures or ethnic groups simultaneously. The authors give examples of how the framework can be used to: discuss cases and clinical problems in the classroom; conduct classroom exercises comparing cultures and differences within cultures; structure student homework and paper assignments; and prepare course materials and lectures.

AB- A fundamental responsibility of social workers is to empower clients to participate in decisions that affect their lives. Social work educators can best teach this concept by empowering their students. This article describes the results of a quasi-experimental study that compared students' perceptions of empowerment in two sections of a graduate social work course at a large public university in Spring 1997. One section was taught through a traditional format of lectures, exams, and papers; the other through techniques intended to empower students: learning contracts, formative evaluations, and narrative evaluations. The authors conclude that student perception of empowerment is positively affected by these teaching techniques. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Schools of social work have long struggled with issues of diversity and how best to train students to work effectively with diverse populations. This article offers a model that infuses multicultural content into the field curriculum and enhances faculty diversity. It describes how diversity has become one of the major objectives of one school's field practice seminars through three unique features: (1) the pairing of community facilitators with faculty facilitators to increase instructors' awareness of diversity, (2) the use of ongoing workshops to train facilitators to address issues of diversity, and (3) the conscious inclusion of diversity content in the seminar curriculum through a variety of methods. This article describes the initiative, its development and key features, evaluation methods, and implications for its adoption at other schools of social work.

AB- This article reports the analysis of 1992 data collected from 211 field instructors associated with 11 Illinois and Wisconsin universities on their satisfaction with faculty field liaisons. The best predictors of field instructor satisfaction were liaison availability and the total number of contacts between the liaison and the field instructor. A support model of field instructor satisfaction explained more variance in satisfaction with the liaison than a reward model. These findings are discussed, as well as their implications for structuring liaison programs to maximize field instructor satisfaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- This article reports the results of a study designed to measure "social work idealism" and factors influencing career choice among beginning Bachelors and Masters level social work students. Influence factors were categorized as altruism, professional concerns, and influence of others. The investigators explored the predictive capacity of idealism and student demographics on the career choice factors reported by students. Overall, idealism ran high among all students, and altruistic reasons were reported as more important than professional reasons in their career choice. Also, students who scored high on social work idealism tended to attach greater importance to altruistic reasons than to professional concerns, as did younger students and female students.

AB- The increasing number of Masters of social work (MSW) students engaged in private psychotherapy practice concurrent with their graduate studies has received little attention in the literature on social work education. This article examines the educational, ethical, and legal dilemmas affected by this trend, and describes the policy developed at the University of Denver to address these problems. A case example is given of a 1st-yr MSW student who was found, through the submission of a paper and videotaped excerpt in a direct practice course, to be conducting a private drug and alcohol counseling practice. Analysis of the material revealed that the student had missed major life-threatening clinical issues and had engaged in very questionable therapeutic processes. More broadly, the authors argue that schools of social work in general have a legitimate interest in adopting policies to prohibit or discourage MSW students from conducting private practice.

AB- This article describes and evaluates the effectiveness of a "Taping Project," a teaching method for student self-evaluation in racism courses which are required of all 1st-yr Masters of Social Work students. The project offers students the opportunity: (a) to hear in private the assumptions about themselves and others that they have brought into the course; (b) to reexamine these assumptions in the context of what they learn in the course; and (c) to consider if and how these assumptions have changed. Formal evaluation of the project's effectiveness in helping students observe and reflect critically on their own development is reported in 2 ways: content analysis of 53 student essays using grounded theory analysis, and student and faculty evaluations of the assignment.

KP- use of practice simulation exercises for transformative learning regarding client social worker interactions & involving observation & feedback
KP- students in health social work practice class
SU- Experiential Learning; Feedback; Simulation; Social Work Education; Therapeutic Processes
AB- Practice simulation exercises involve interaction with people who portray standardized clients in typical social work practice contexts. They are followed by feedback from these "clients" and from peers and instructors. This article delineates the conceptual background and previous use of this educational methodology and illustrates its application within a graduate health social work practice class. A preliminary evaluation found enthusiastic endorsement of this approach among students, with very strong agreement that all 3 components of the project -- interaction with simulated clients, receipt of feedback, and participation as Os -- prove useful. Practice simulations can allow transformative learning for participants and provide a useful classroom method for incorporating conceptual foundations into practice behaviors.

The author describes the importance of reducing homophobia among social work students and presents a theoretical framework for the educational intervention used in this study. Although knowledge acquisition significantly increased among students in both of the study's treatment groups relative to the comparison group, and although students from 1 treatment group showed significant improvement in their attitudes toward gay men relative to the comparison group, neither treatment group significantly improved in their attitudes toward lesbians or their anticipated professional behavior with lesbian clients relative to the comparison group.

SU- Advocacy; Laws; Policy Making; Social Work Education; Teaching
AB- This article reports on the development of an innovative family policy practice course for direct practice students in social work programs that emphasizes experiential learning to develop policy practice skills. The course uses a policy practice framework to understand the creation and implementation of major family legislation. A semester-long project provides students with opportunities to develop skills in advocacy, policy development, and planning by working for social change in the community. The article discusses examples of projects that have been implemented by students, such as working with public housing tenants to change a local HMO's health care policies, increasing handicapped accessibility in an organization, and using local churches as a resource for pregnancy prevention programs. The article also discusses challenges to teaching experiential methods for skill-building, and provides critical evaluation of the projects and their relevance for macro practice research.

AB- This article revisits the question, pursued in an interchange between Thomas (1978) and Gambrill and Barth (1980), on whether conflicts exist between service goals and research goals in the use of single-system experimental designs (SSDs) for practice evaluation. The authors approach the issue through an analysis of how informed consent is handled in one widely used textbook promoting the SSD model of practice evaluation. They argue that the text's suggestions for what to tell the client about reasons for using SSDs ignore knowledge acquisition goals emphasized elsewhere in the text, thus obscuring possible conflicts between the needs of the client and the requirements of SSD methodology. These failures of informed consent reveal largely neglected conflicts between practice and evaluation goals within the SSD model commonly taught to social work students.

AB- Many social work educators are searching for ways to integrate course content on women, while preserving time-tested models of assessment and intervention. Although women comprise the majority of social work clients, most psychological models of assessment and intervention are based on male psychological development. In contrast, feminist theories and therapies have turned attention to female psychological development and how this differs from male progression. This article describes and discusses a psychotherapeutic model for practice and education that allows for balanced gender sensitivity and that can be readily superimposed on existing models for more effective assessment and intervention.

AB- This study, involving 222 Masters of Social Work students from 2 universities, examined the impact of a course on societal oppression. Pre- and posttests designed to measure belief in a just world and commitment to social justice were administered to 2 comparison groups before and after the course was offered; the posttest was also given to 2 other comparison groups. Results show that students tended to accept the just world ideology, and acceptance increased for students who took the oppression course; self-reported advocacy behaviors also increased somewhat, though unevenly; and students who believed in a just world and engaged in fewer advocacy behaviors experienced more distress when confronted with evidence of injustice. Possible reasons for both expected and unexpected findings are explored, as are the implications for social work education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- To ensure accountability, social work students learn to evaluate their practice, often by measuring outcomes through direct observation. Simply recording the frequency, duration, or rate of a client's target problems, however, may not be sufficient. This article discusses the evaluative and clinical benefits of monitoring both opportunities for target behavior to occur and the client's responses. It examines criteria for choosing opportunities and responses as units of observation, operational definitions of these units, and scales on which to rate clients' responses during baseline and intervention phases, along with ways to display and analyze findings. Case studies from student projects support the text. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)

SU- Community Mental Health Services; Mental Disorders; Psychosocial Rehabilitation; Social Work Education; Social Workers
AB- The Clubhouse Model of community support is enjoying renewed interest among social workers and social work educators concerned with alternatives to traditional forms of community mental health treatment and rehabilitation. This article describes the model and its underlying congruence with social work theory and practice. Some of the main features of the model are: (a) respect and equality among members and staff; (b) attention to all aspects of each member's life, with emphasis on the importance of work and accepting responsibility; (c) a focus on members' strengths and competencies. A distinction is made between the Clubhouse Model and day treatment programs for the mentally ill. Findings of the National Task Analysis Study of Social Work Practice are presented that suggest an increasingly important role for social workers and social work educators in the continued growth of this practice model.
