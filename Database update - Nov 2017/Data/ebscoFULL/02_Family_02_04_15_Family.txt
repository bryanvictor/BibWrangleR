AB- All the experiences which come to an individual may be classified according as they are constructive in the sense of being of value for a progressive growth toward stable adult integration, or destructive if they have the obverse effect. The entire history of a child may be analyzed from this point of view, and each experience put into its proper setting. It then becomes the problem of the mental hygienist to determine for that individual the value of different types of behavior and select the environmental factors which will lead to integration and avoid regression toward infantile reactions.

AB- The authors suggest a method for the checking of social welfare activities, so as to obtain definite information upon which to decide whether their influence is dysgenic or eugenic in nature and whether their work is for the good or ill of contemporaneous society. They studied 80 children, from 23 marginal families, who were receiving aid. The percentage of intellectually inferior children was somewhat larger than in the general population. But the percentage of behavior difficulties was small, and the children showed normal emotional reactions and family relationships. On the whole, they seemed likely to develop into well-adjusted and socially desirable adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- In a family the ideal interrelationship, in which each member influences and is influenced by every other member, rarely exists. The natural circularity of response is broken by attitudes of authority, domination and sense of superiority of parents toward children. The father or mother commands; the child obeys. Very little reciprocal stimulation is permitted. If the parent has harbored some unfulfilled desire or ambition for fame, money, education, social prestige, or what-not, he or she projects this ambition upon one or more of the children. The parent tries to live in the children, instead of allowing them to develop their own desires and ambitions. The projection occurs most frequently from father to son and from mother to daughter.

The efficient administration of labor relationships depends upon the clearness with which we see economic conditions and possibilities on the one hand and human factors on the other. Monotony is probably less important to the worker than theorists believe it to be. The possibility of betterment in industrial relations depends upon the development of plans along lines similar to those of the "case work method."

AB- The case worker often finds that the giving of relief seems to result in a loss of self-respect in formerly self-reliant clients. This deterioration in the client is wrongly attributed to the effect of relief itself, whereas it is due to an emotional dependency produced either by the feeling of insecurity following social maladjustment, or to personality difficulties existing previous to the granting of relief. It is the function of the case worker to evaluate the personality assets and liabilities of the client in order to prevent emotional dependency rather than to discourage dependency merely by reducing or withholding relief, which is the "modus operandi of the family case worker until she establishes contact as the basis for influence."

Both originate as a result of pleasurable sensory stimulation very early in life, but separate early and develop as isolated developmental trends.

AB- Legally, a delinquent is a transgressor of the law. Psychologically, the delinquent is a child seeking emotional satisfactions which he cannot find in the environment in which he lives. He is differentiated from other children by a greater degree of egocentrism and by a lack of emotional balance. A persistence in old habits and a lack of suggestibility to new leads are also traits characteristic of such children. Emotions are more important than intelligence in determining the degree of adjustment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)

AB- Examination of the case records of alcoholics in the light of modern theory suggests that the alcoholic man suffers from a conflict between masculine and feminine impulses. In his drinking bouts he works out a wish for the companionship of men and the desire to receive by mouth something potent enough to overwhelm him. These impulses are accompanied by an enormous amount of hostility toward his wife and children. The relationship between the man and his wife is extremely complicated. The woman finds an outlet for her aggressive impulses in a partnership with a man who is partially dependent and who creates situations that almost force her to punish him. Both partners, therefore, alternate between a "masculine" and a "feminine" position. Since cure of chronic alcoholism is extremely difficult, the goal of the case worker should be a diminution of the number of sprees and a lengthening of the intervals between. The author feels this is best done by assisting the man to achieve a masculine role in the face of society and by supporting the woman's desire to help her husband.

AB- Problems faced by the family case worker in dealing with normal adolescents are discussed. Through reporting two extensive case histories, the following generalizations emerge: "The worker's attitude is of more importance than what she actually says." She must strive for consistency, "especially in the face of the adolescent's inconsistency and changability." The adolescent's tendency to imitate may be used by the worker to offer acceptable standards of ethics, thus helping to solve the conflict between super-ego and id. Avenues of sublimation must be provided in terms of needs of the particular individual, and should not be presented in a haphazard manner. Relief-giving must be handled tactfully, since the adolescent may be acutely embarrassed by his newly felt lack of money. Sex education can be given effectively, for the case worker is often the only person with whom the adolescent can talk naturally on this subject.

AB- [Abstracted review, original not seen.] As the case worker must disclose to her client his abnormal position in order to create understanding on his part, she must have a clear distinction between normal and abnormal. The author defines normal as the socially accepted desirable standards of behavior found in the laws and mores. The normal person is one who properly combines the 4 layers of the general psychical energy stream: purely sensual and sexual, tender or affectionate layer, object relationship segment, and the more nearly intellectual and impersonal sublimated area. The object relationship, the normal relationship of maturity, predominates in social case work. Abnormality may be due to a lack of development (as in delinquency) or to distortion (as in psychosis).

The importance of establishing rapport between caseworker and unmarried mother cannot be sufficiently stressed.

AB- The author describes the case of an adolescent girl, aged 17, the child of divorced parents, whose early life was spent with various relatives and whose mother at no time showed affection toward her. Later the mother remarried a man whom the girl greatly disliked and of whose young daughter she became intensely jealous. With advancing age her behavior showed increased maladjustment. Serious sexual delinquency eventually led her mother to seek help from a social agency. The girl was enabled to obtain a better understanding of herself; later she secured a job in a defense plant where she has made a good record.

AB- A case is described in which placement in an institution for dependent children was recommended and carried out for a boy of 9 years of age whose widowed mother had developed an unhealthy sexual attitude toward him. The mother herself had been reared by elderly people and had little contact with persons of her own age. She had received no sex information and was greatly shocked by her early marital experience. She continued to maintain an attitude of childish dependence toward her mother, who lived with her throughout her married life and after she became widowed. Both mother and grandmother fondled the boy excessively. Night terrors in which the lad dreamed that his father (to whom he had been closely attached) came out of his coffin and whipped him severely were diagnosed as evidences of an extreme Oedipus conflict. Under these circumstances, removal from the home was advised. After a few months in the children's home, the boy seemed to be making a good adjustment.

The over-all need for further study is pointed out to enable the social worker to see more clearly what conditions are and with what techniques foster family care can be used in those cases where parent-child relationships are destructive.

Its use as a gauge for the effectiveness of treatment as well as for diagnostic and prognostic purposes is pointed out. Consideration is made of the techniques involved in administering and scoring the test, specifically mentioning the significance of the various scoring categories. Emphasis is placed upon the use of this projective technique as a method which reveals the internal organization of the individual and the underlying strata of the personality.

AB- A study is made of the Rorschach test as a diagnostic tool in a test battery. The test can be used as an aid in discriminating between a neurosis and a psychosis, between a conversion hysteria and a genuine organic disease, between a neurosis and a primary behavior disorder, or between a schizoid personality and an active psychotic process. It also reveals to the therapist such significant factors as aggression or passivity, flexibility or rigidity, quality of the affective reaction, hidden complexes, anxiety manifestations and the manner of coping with such anxiety. Two cases treated are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)
