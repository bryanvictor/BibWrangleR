Examining the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) instrument among 300 Ghanaians from a cross-sectional design, Principal Component Analysis yielded four factors (positive interaction, trust building, information giving, and essential support), which accounted for 85.73% of the total variance in the MOS-SSS. A logistic regression analysis showed that essential support was the strongest predictor of the length of time an individual stayed in the support group, whereas positive interaction indicated negative association.

Parents of 75 adolescents with type 1 diabetes were interviewed using the Reaction to Diagnosis Interview. Parents and adolescents completed questionnaires regarding the child's physical health, self-management of the disease, and behavioral and emotional problems. Physicians reported adolescents' HbA1c levels. Results showed that adolescents whose fathers were resolved with the diagnosis exhibited better diabetes self-management and adolescents whose mothers were resolved with the diagnosis exhibited fewer internalizing and externalizing problems. The findings highlight the different role of mothers and fathers in the treatment of adolescents with diabetes and provide a basis for clinical intervention that focuses not only on adolescent health, but also on parental state of mind regarding the resolution with the disease.",Parental Resolution and the Adolescent's Health and Adjustment: The Case of Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes.,2015,NA,Soc Work Health Care"Having children is a growing reality for women living with HIV in Canada. It is imperative to understand and respond to women's unique experiences and psychosocial challenges during pregnancy and as mothers including HIV-related stigma. This qualitative study used a narrative methodological approach to understand women's experiences of HIV-related stigma as they navigate health services in pregnancy (nÂ =Â 66) and early postpartum (nÂ =Â 64). Narratives of women living with HIV expose the spaces where stigmatizing practices emerge as women seek perinatal care and support, as well as highlight the relationship between HIV-related stigma and disclosure, and the impact this has on women's pregnancy and birthing experiences.",NA,2015,NA,Soc Work Health Care,Editorial Board EOV.,2015,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The purpose of this research is to investigate various factors predicting online health information seeking for themselves (self OHIS) and online health information seeking for others (surrogate OHIS) in family caregivers to cancer survivors. To address this purpose, this study applies the comprehensive model of information seeking as a theoretical framework for explaining the relationships between various predictors and two types of OHIS. The data used in this study were taken from the Health Information National Trends Survey 4. A total of 1,113 family caregivers were included in this study. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of predictors on Internet use for health information seeking. Caregivers' self and surrogate OHIS were commonly predicted by their self-rated health and attention to the Internet. However, age, race, and education were significantly associated with self OHIS only, while gender and marital status were significantly associated with surrogate OHIS only. These results suggest that family caregivers' self and surrogate OHIS are predicted by common factors, as well as predicted by different specific factors.",Predictors of Self and Surrogate Online Health Information Seeking in Family Caregivers to Cancer Survivors.,2015,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Policymakers and researchers emphasize needs for an integrated, effective, and efficient health care system to address well-documented disparities and inequities in care experienced by diverse populations.

Children in the Michigan Migrant Head Start were classified depending on years of enrollments: One year (nÂ =Â 638), two years (nÂ =Â 293), and three or more years (nÂ =Â 426). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine whether the probability of children receiving health treatment differed depending on years of enrollment. There is a higher health treatment rate among children who attended Head Start for multiple years than for those who attended for one year. Children's special needs status, of siblings, ethnicity, parental educational level, and marital status were related to preventative dental and physical health treatment outcomes. Although the primary goal of Head Start is school readiness rather than health improvement, migrant and seasonal farmworker children are likely to receive more health treatment if they attend more years of comprehensive intervention, such as Head Start, for positive physical and dental health.",The Impact of Head Start Enrollment Duration on Migrant Children's Health Outcomes.,2015,United States,Soc Work Health Care"In 2010, the Preventable Admissions Care Team (PACT), a social work-led transitional care model, was developed at Mount Sinai to reduce 30-day readmissions among high-risk patients.

A school-based survey, the YRBS includes youths who have been difficult to involve in past research. Analysis of 2011 YRBS data produced population-weighted estimates of youth homelessness prevalence separately for Connecticut, Delaware, and Philadelphia. Public high school students anonymously reported their housing status, height, and weight on the YRBS. Height and weight were converted to body mass index (BMI) percentile-for-age scores. Homelessness was associated with higher BMI percentile scores for youths compared with nonhomeless peers. Associations between BMI percentile and different forms of homelessness (homeless with family, unaccompanied homeless without family) were explored at each site. Estimates of one-month homelessness prevalence ranged from 3.9 percent to 5.9 percent at each site. Homelessness, especially family homelessness, is associated with risk for higher BMI.

Mediation path analysis was used to estimate relationships between contextual factors, acculturative stress, and psychological distress. The fit of the data to the final model was adequate as estimated using chi-square analysis, comparative fit index, Tucker-Lewis Index, and root-mean-square error of approximation. Racial discrimination (b = 0.38, p = .01), difficulties visiting family abroad (b = 0.26, p = .03), and age at immigration (b = 0.19, p = .03) were positively associated with acculturative stress. The factor English skills (b = -0.31, p = .02) was negatively associated with acculturative stress. Racial discrimination had the strongest effect on acculturative stress, followed by English skills, difficulties visiting family abroad, and age at immigration. Racial discrimination (b = 0.39, p = .01) and financial constraints (b = 0.30, p = .01) were positively associated with psychological distress.

This study used a qualitative research design to recruit 12 participants, who were family caregivers, from the adult neurology and neurosurgery units at a hospital located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The data were collected using semistructured interviews, which were conducted in person and ranged between 30 and 60 minutes in length. Analysis of the data was conducted using phenomenological guidelines and principles. Upon review, the results indicated that the participants shared common experiences that were grouped into three main themes: (1) unfamiliarity with the hospital environment and procedures, (2) identifying the hidden realities of families and caregivers, and (3) strengthening collaborative dialogues and opportunities. Overall, this study exemplified that the need to continue to recognize family caregivers' experiences and their involvement is paramount in being able to understand how and in what way patient care can be better optimized collaboratively, during treatment delivery and recovery stages.",Qualitative Study: Exploring the Experiences of Family Caregivers within an Inpatient Neurology and Neurosurgery Hospital Setting.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"This article proposes the use of attachment theory in clinical social work practice.

The Multiple Family Group service delivery model to reduce childhood disruptive behavior disorders (MFG) has shown promise in engaging child welfare-involved families. This qualitative study examines caregiver perceptions of factors that influence retention in MFGs among child welfare-involved families.METHODS: Twenty-five predominantly Black and Hispanic adult (ages 26-57) female caregivers with child welfare services involvement participated in individual, in-depth interviews about their experience with MFGs. Transcribed interview data were thematically coded guided by grounded theory methodology. Emergent themes were subsequently organized into a conceptual framework.RESULTS: Within the overarching influence of child welfare services involvement, specific components of MFGs influencing retention included the quality of interaction among group members, group facilitators' attentive approach with caregivers, supports designed to overcome logistical barriers (i.e., child care, transportation expenses, meals), and perceptions of MFG content and activities as fun and helpful. Caregiver factors, including their mental health and personal characteristics, as well as children's behavior, (i.e., observed changes in behavioral difficulties) were also associated with retention.CONCLUSIONS: High acceptability suggest utility for implementing MFGs within settings serving child welfare involved families, with additional modifications to tailor to setting and client features.",Multiple Family Groups for Child Behavior Difficulties Retention Among Child Welfare-Involved Caregivers.,2015,United States,Res Soc Work Pract"Youth living in poverty face compounding familial and environmental challenges in utilizing effective community mental health services. They have ongoing stressors that increase their dropout rate in mental health service use. Difficulties also exist in staying engaged in services when they are involved with the child welfare system. This study examines the 4Rs 2Ss Family Strengthening Program, developed across four broad conceptual categories related to parenting skills and family processes that form a multiple family group service delivery approach. A total of 321 families were enrolled in this randomized intervention study, assigned to either the 4Rs 2Ss Family Strengthening Program or standard care services. Caregivers and their children randomly assigned to the experimental condition received a 16 week multiple family group intervention through their respective outpatient community mental health clinic.

Purposive sampling was used to select sixty parents of children aged 10 or younger living in four mid-sized California cities. Data were collected via in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Many parents viewed drinking at family get-togethers or parties as protective of children, since the presence of multiple adults and children provide buffers when parents become intoxicated.

It is important to understand more about this population and, more specifically, about the relationship between youth mental health and caregiver mental health and trauma exposure among homeless families, in order to better serve the needs of this vulnerable population. The objective of this study is to explore the relationships between caregiver exposure to violence, caregiver depression, and youth depression and behavioral problems among homeless families. Preliminary findings indicate that among this sample of homeless families, caregiver violence exposure has statistically significant relationships with both youth behavioral problems and youth depression symptoms, as mediated by caregiver depression. These findings indicate that youth behavioral health is associated with caregiver mental health, which, in turn, is associated with caregiver trauma exposure. This highlights the importance of taking into account adult mental health while treating youth externalizing and internalizing behaviors and ensuring that caregivers, too, have access to adequate treatment and supports.

A cross-sectional research design was employed with a sample of 94 social workers, 97 nurses, and 104 medical residents recruited from eight hospitals in Los Angeles. Bivariate correlations explored whether seven scales (Patient Advocacy Eagerness, Ethical Commitment, Skills, Tangible Support, Organizational Receptivity, Belief Other Professionals Engage, and Belief the Hospital Empowers Patients) were associated with patient advocacy engagement, measured by the validated Patient Advocacy Engagement Scale. Regression analysis examined whether these scales, when controlling for sociodemographic and setting variables, predicted patient advocacy engagement. While all seven predictor scales were significantly associated with patient advocacy engagement in correlational analyses, only Eagerness, Skills, and Belief the Hospital Empowers Patients predicted patient advocacy engagement in regression analyses. Additionally, younger professionals engaged in higher levels of patient advocacy than older professionals, and social workers engaged in greater patient advocacy than nurses. Limitations and the utility of these findings for acute-care hospitals are discussed.",Predicting Patient Advocacy Engagement: A Multiple Regression Analysis Using Data From Health Professionals in Acute-Care Hospitals.,2015,United States,Soc Work Health Care,Addressing the Needs of Individuals with Autism: Role of Hospital-Based Social Workers in Implementation of a Patient-Centered Care Plan.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"The study reported in this article was conducted in response to Utah service provider concerns that men with hemophilia may be disengaged from their local community-based support network. This study explored the challenges, adaptations, and needs of men with hemophilia from the perspective of Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) social workers. Utah's two active HTC social workers participated in face-to-face interviews. Fourteen HTC social workers from surrounding regions completed written interviews. The researcher used a qualitative, grounded theory approach to analyze the data. Resilience theory provided a lens for interpreting the results. Findings from these professionals indicate that men with hemophilia appear to be ambivalent toward services that are available to them for reasons that include work and insurance status, prior personal history with the bleeding disorders community, strength of relationship with local service providers, degree of customization of HTC services, and the desire to maintain personal independence. Understanding this dynamic may be helpful in developing services that are more specifically tailored to the needs of men with hemophilia, in addition to potentially providing stronger community-based support to men with other genetic disorders.",Social Worker Perceptions and Observations Regarding Men's Management of Hemophilia and Use of Community-Based Support.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"In trauma care, the patient is the primary focus of attention. However, patients' relatives also need attention, for two main reasons. First, the support of relatives is an important factor in the convalescence of patients. Second, the trauma means a serious disruption of not only the life of patients, but also that of their relatives. The purpose of this study was to explore the needs of relatives of trauma patients, to what extent these needs are met by the support of social workers, and how relatives benefit from this support. The study was conducted in hospitals in The Netherlands. Needs were measured using the Dutch version of the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory. Results of in-depth interviews were used to develop a questionnaire to explore the type of social worker support and to what extent relatives benefit from this support. Findings show that trauma patients' relatives have a need for information, access to the patient and hospital staff, and psychosocial assistance. In most cases social workers supported relatives and relatives benefited from the support. To ensure that trauma patients' relatives receive the support they need, social workers should be involved in trauma care as the standard of good care.",Psychosocial Needs of Relatives of Trauma Patients.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"Marginalized populations may be predisposed to poor health outcomes due to health dis parities. Although much of the research on health and quality of life is from the perspective of the impact of clinical diagnosis, there is a need for more diverse inquiries and recognition of the individuals' perceptions and preferences. The present study examined the importance of an individual's perception of his or her current health in predicting quality of life over and beyond the presence of physical or mental health conditions. The sample included 150 low-income adults, of which 84.7 percent were African American and 15.4 percent were of another minority race or ethnicity. Participants had an average monthly income of $703. Having a better perception of health was significantly associated with increased quality of life scores. Subjective perceptions of current health were a better predictor of quality of life than the presence of a serious physical or mental health condition. The article ends with a discussion of appropriate interventions to improve health perceptions in similar populations predisposed to poor health outcomes.",Health Perceptions and Quality of Life among Low-Income Adults.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"A documentary film on HIV was developed based on social cognitive theory and entertainment educational methods in an effort to increase awareness and encourage protective behavior change related to HIV among older adults. The documentary includes perspectives from racial- or ethnic-minority older adults who are living with HIV and those of health care providers, and was screened in several venues. Authors of this article conducted thematic content analysis of anonymous, written, open-ended responses from 341 film viewers (clinicians and laypeople) who described what they learned about HIV after viewing the film. Four key themes emerged from the analysis: (1) increased awareness about the epidemiology of HIV among older, minority groups and about sexuality among older people; (2) improved general HIV knowledge, including risk reduction strategies and details about HIV testing; (3) awareness of lack of sexual health education among health care providers, and that a call to action is needed; and (4) awareness that HIV reinfection can occur in certain circumstances with people who are already infected. Findings suggest that an educational documentary can be used to effectively increase awareness and knowledge about the impact of HIV among minority older adults, and may also encourage HIV prevention action steps by providers.",HIV Awareness and Knowledge among Viewers of a Documentary Film about HIV among Racial- or Ethnic-Minority Older Adults.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"In the past few years, gambling among adolescents has become a common health risk behavior, one that might lead to other health risk behaviors. Research on the etiology of gambling behavior among adolescents has hitherto focused primarily on the factors contributing to increased gambling severity (GS). The present study is different, in that it examines two key personality components that may help curb GS: self-control (SC) and positivity ratio (PR)--the latter being defined as the positive ratio between positive and negative affects--as factors that predict reduced GS among adolescents. A convenience sample of 595 adolescents, ages 13 to 19 (M = 15.13, SD = 1.53), from six secondary and middle schools in five major cities in Israel, was taken between February and April 2012. Four instruments were used: a Gambling Behavior Scale, the DSM-IV (adapted for juveniles), the Adolescent SC Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The main findings showed that PR moderated the association between SC and GS--highlighting the importance of PR in reducing the likelihood of problem gambling and bolstering the individual's SC skills and pointing to possible preventive actions that might be taken in the community to promote healthy adolescent behavior.",Contribution of Positivity Ratio and Self-Control to Reduced Gambling Severity among Adolescents.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"This article describes the role of social workers in addressing the needs of people with heart failure. Although previous studies have explored the role of social workers in health care settings, few studies have addressed the challenges of specific chronic diseases such as heart failure. To address this gap in the literature, this study used qualitative interviews with health care social workers (n = 8) to obtain in-depth information about activities and challenges related to heart failure care. Findings suggest that health care social workers perceive heart failure as characterized by an uncertain illness trajectory, frequent hospitalizations, and difficulties accessing formal and informal care. These findings suggest the importance of what we term illness-informed social work, a practice that combines heart failure knowledge with social work competencies to address the complex psychosocial issues in heart failure care.",Addressing Heart Failure Challenges through Illness-Informed Social Work.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"This article describes the development of an integrated psychosocial patient and caregiver assessment and plan of care for hospice social work documentation. A team of hospice social workers developed the Social Work Assessment Notes as a quality improvement project in collaboration with the information technology department. Using the Social Work Assessment Tool as an organizing framework, this comprehensive hospice social work documentation system is designed to integrate assessment, planning, and outcomes measurement. The system was developed to guide the assessment of patients' and caregivers' needs related to end-of-life psychosocial issues, to facilitate collaborative care plan development, and to measure patient- and family-centered outcomes. Goals established with the patient and the caregiver are documented in the plan of care and become the foundation for patient-centered, strengths-based interventions. Likert scales are used to assign numerical severity levels for identified issues and progress made toward goals and to track the outcome of social work interventions across nine psychosocial constructs. The documentation system was developed for use in an electronic health record but can be used for paper charting. Future plans include automated aggregate outcomes measurement to identify the most effective interventions and best practices in end-of-life care.",Social Work Assessment Notes: A Comprehensive Outcomes-Based Hospice Documentation System.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"The rapid growth of the population of older adults and their concomitant psychological status and health needs have captured the attention of researchers and health professionals. To help fill the void of literature available to social workers interested in mental health promotion and aging, the authors provide a model for active aging that uses psychosocial variables. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships among the latent variables of the state of explicit memory, the perception of social resources, depression, and the perception of quality of life in a sample of 184 older adults. The results suggest that explicit memory is not a direct indicator of the perception of quality of life, but it could be considered an indirect indicator as it is positively correlated with perception of social resources and negatively correlated with depression. These last two variables influenced the perception of quality of life directly, the former positively and the latter negatively. The main outcome suggests that the perception of social support improves explicit memory and quality of life and reduces depression in active older adults. The findings also suggest that gerontological professionals should design memory training programs, improve available social resources, and offer environments with opportunities to exercise memory.",Modeling Active Aging and Explicit Memory: An Empirical Study.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"Individuals with subthreshold psychotic experiences are at increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behavior, similar to those with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. This may be explained by shared risk factors such as heightened stress sensitivity or low self-esteem. Understanding the nature of this relationship could inform suicide prevention in social work practice. In this study, authors examined the relationship between self-reported auditory hallucinations and suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts, in a nonclinical sample of young adults, controlling for scores on the Psychological Stress Index and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Auditory hallucinations were associated with approximately double the odds of suicidal ideation and plans and four times the odds for suicide attempts. This relationship was not explained by stress sensitivity or self-esteem, which were independently related to hallucinations and suicidality, respectively. Subthreshold auditory hallucinations may be a useful indicator of suicide risk. This association may represent a clinically significant relationship that may be addressed through social work interventions intended to alleviate stress sensitivity or improve self-esteem.","Suicide Risk, Stress Sensitivity, and Self-Esteem among Young Adults Reporting Auditory Hallucinations.",2015,United States,Health Soc Work,Social Security Disability Insurance: How Social Workers Can Support Necessary Action.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"Many developing regions are facing a youth bulge, meaning that young people comprise the highest proportion of the population. These regions are at risk of losing what could be a tremendous opportunity for economic growth and development if they do not capitalize on this young and economically productive population - also referred to as the &quot;demographic dividend,&quot; defined as the increase in economic growth that tends to follow increases in the ratio of the working-age population - essentially the labor force - to dependents. Nations undergoing this population transition have the opportunity to capitalize on the demographic dividend if the right social, economic, and human capital policies are in place. In particular, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and North Africa are at risk of losing the demographic dividend. These regions face high youth unemployment, low primary school completion, and low secondary school enrollment. This results in an undereducated and unskilled segment of the population. The prohibitive costs of education prevent young people from finishing school, thereby entering the labor market unprepared.

Given that about three-fourths of payday loan customers are repeat borrowers, consumer advocates and policymakers have increasingly raised voices of concern about the use of payday loans to finance various household expenses, including, among other things, medical bills. The present study hypothesized that increases in medical debt are associated with increases in payday loan debt among a sample of Chapter 7 bankruptcy filers. The results of a multivariate tobit regression analysis showed that medical debt was associated with increased payday loan debt, controlling for various types of debt and other socioeconomic variables.

Women in Canada experienced better care particularly as compared to women who were inadequately insured in the United States. Women in Canada were diagnosed earlier (rate ratio [RR] = 1.12) and enjoyed better access to breast conserving surgery (RR = 1.48), radiation (RR = 1.60) and hormone therapies (RR = 1.78). Women living in high poverty Canadian neighborhoods even experienced shorter waits for surgery (RR = 0.58) and radiation therapy (RR = 0.44) than did such women in the US. Consequently, women in Canada were much more likely to survive longer. Regression analyses indicated that health insurance could explain most of the better care and better outcomes in Canada. Over this study's 15-year timeframe 31,500 late diagnoses, 94,500 sub-optimum treatment plans and 103,500 early deaths were estimated in high poverty US neighborhoods due to relatively inadequate health insurance coverage.

We found that a central issue in the wishes for living at a later age are adjustments to envisioned physical limitations that come with the ageing process; this includes adjustments to ensure safety, accessibility and mobility, in order to facilitate older individuals' efforts to stay engaged with the world around them. In their wishes, the older participants constructed ideal dwelling places that closely resembled a senior home, but at the same time they rejected wishing to live in a place that was identified as a senior home. We explain this paradox by the representation of such a space as being for old people, i.e. needy older individuals, which was not how the older participants wished to be identified. We conclude that the conception of age-friendly environments will have to face the difficult challenge of overcoming the association with old age, while simultaneously taking into account adjustments that signify and relate to the ageing process and that seem inescapably tied to oldness.",Overcoming Old in Age-Friendliness.,2015,NA,J Soc Work Pract,Social work expertise: an overlooked opportunity for cutting-edge system design under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.,2015,United States,Health Soc Work"Childhood obesity can be effectively addressed with behavioral interventions in programs such as CATCH and Planet Health using a multidisciplinary approach.

Children in the Michigan Migrant Head Start program were classified depending on years of enrollments: one year (n = 638), two years (n = 293), and three or more years (n = 426). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine whether the probability of children having overweight or obesity differed depending on years of enrollment. There is a lower obesity rate among children who attended Head Start for multiple years than in those who attended for one year. Among children who attended for one year, those who enrolled for more weeks were more likely to be overweight than those who enrolled for fewer weeks. Children with special needs, those with more siblings, and those on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) had a lower obesity rate. Although the primary goal of the Head Start Program is school readiness rather than health improvement, migrant and seasonal farmworkers' children might need more years of comprehensive intervention, such as Head Start, to prevent obesity by making full use of the beneficial nutrition programs.

Although health care discrimination against transgender people has been documented, this issue is understudied. Using a national cross-sectional survey data set (N = 1,711), the authors sought to determine how gender identity and presentation predict health care discrimination experiences among female-to-male (FTM) transgender people after demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled. Analyses were conducted using chi-square tests and a two-step logistic regression. The majority of participants were white (73.9 percent) and between 25 and 44 years old (65.2 percent). Overall, 41.8 percent of FTM participants reported verbal harassment, physical assault, or denial of equal treatment in a doctor's office or hospital. When other factors were controlled, being Native American or multiracial, identifying as queer or asexual/other, having a graduate degree, living full-time as nonbirth gender, using hormones or surgery for medical transition, and having identification documents that list one's preferred gender were associated with increased reporting of health care discrimination experiences; being 45 years or older and reporting an annual income of $60,000 or more were associated with decreased risk.

The study reported in this article aimed to assess the effect of preadmission counseling for patients planning to undergo major surgical therapy for head and neck cancer. Ten patients who received preadmission counseling were surveyed to ascertain the utility of it in regard to multiple social and logistical factors. Comparisons were made with patients who did not receive such counseling. Staff perceptions were likewise obtained. The surveys indicated that preadmission counseling helped in regard to improving peri-admission support and access to financial and logistical resources, and lowered levels of anxiety during admission.

A standardized self-administered cross-sectional survey was administered to ever-partnered adult women ages 18 to 70 years receiving care at primary health care centers (N = 10,322). Logistic regression analyzed the association between the level of rurality and health indicators, IPV, and use of services. The lowest frequency of IPV among women is reflected in higher rurality. Women of medium and low rurality presented a poorer self-perceived health and more physical health problems. Women from medium and low rurality areas declared seeking health services more frequently.

The authors investigated whether there is any association between caste- and ethnicity-based inequalities and HIV-related knowledge within caste and ethnic populations. They used the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally represented cross-sectional study data set. The study sample consisted of 11,273 women between 15 and 49 years of age. Univariate and logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between caste- and ethnicity-based inequalities and HIV-related knowledge. The study sample was divided into high Hindu caste (47.9 percent), &quot;untouchable&quot; caste (18.4 percent), and indigenous populations (33.7 percent). Within the study sample, the high-caste population was found to have the greatest knowledge of the means by which HIV is prevented and transmitted. After controlling for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, untouchables were the least knowledgeable. The odds ratio for incomplete knowledge about transmission among indigenous populations was 1.27 times higher than that for high Hindu castes, but there was no significant difference in knowledge of preventive measures. The findings suggest the existence of a prevailing HIV knowledge gap.

Trainers reported that the majority of participants had a relative or significant other who influenced their health behaviors, and they saw potential value in involving them in efforts to improve health outcomes by extending support into participants' daily lives. They did not feel qualified to work with families of individuals with mental illness, but they were willing to partner with providers who had experience in this area.

It also demonstrates how core concepts of social work practice, such as family systems theory, the strengths perspective, and use of self, can be applied to practice with dementia-affected persons. In addition, it provides practical suggestions for supporting care partners in nurturing &quot;we-ness&quot;, focusing on what remains rather than was is lost, and remaining authentic. When strengths-based social work practice is integrated into dementia care protocols, wellbeing can increase. As a result, the more than 40 million persons worldwide who are affected by dementia do not have to resign themselves to the despair, devastation and inevitable demise of quality of life that dominate perception of the illness.",Living better with dementia: strengths-based social work practice and dementia care.,2015,United States,Soc Work Health Care"With the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and ongoing health care reform efforts, this is a critical time for the social work profession.

Narrative therapeutic approaches offer promise, as well as challenges, for social interventions with couples where one partner has dementia. The Couples Life Story Approach is a recently-developed method by which practitioners work with such couples to help them narrate the story of their life together. This narrative approach is augmented by mementoes (e.g., photos, cards) that are collected by the couple during the intervention. Significant memories are elicited from both partners and developed into a Life Story Book. Drawing on data from this clinical research intervention with 20 older couples, we ask: What are some of the challenges of conducting narrative-based therapeutic interventions with older couples with memory loss? Clinical themes were identified utilizing a multiple case study approach during weekly team meetings. Six of the most prominent themes are presented here. Specifically, how to: (1) construct a narrative from disparate stories, (2) tell a mutual story, (3) tell the story of a couple that has been in a shorter relationship, (4) incorporate others in the story, (5) include difficult life moments, and, (6) end the story. Within each theme, we utilize case examples to illuminate relevant issues and describe strategies that were developed to resolve these clinical challenges.

Understanding why the problem exists and why the solution should work requires a consideration of cause and effect. However, it is unclear whether it is desirable for social workers to identify cause and effect, whether it is possible for social workers to identify cause and effect, and, if so, what is the best means for doing so. These questions are central to determining the possibility of developing a science of social work and how we go about doing it. This article has four aims: (1) provide an overview of the nature of causality; (2) examine how causality is treated in social work research and practice; (3) highlight the role of quantitative and qualitative methods in the search for causality; and (4) demonstrate how both methods can be employed to support a &quot;science&quot; of social work.",Causality and Causal Inference in Social Work: Quantitative and Qualitative Perspectives.,2015,United States,Res Soc Work Pract"Drawing on Earnshaw and Chaudoir's HIV stigma framework, this study explored the experiences of persons living with HIV and AIDS regarding stigmatization and discrimination in accessing health services. Using a qualitative research methodology, 42 participants were purposively recruited during support group meetings of persons living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) at Amasaman in Accra, Ghana. Four focus group discussions (n = 22) and 10 in-depth interviews were conducted. Discussions and interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and categorized based on the objectives of the study. The findings indicated that PLWHAs had knowledge of stigma that was experienced through enacted, anticipated, and internalized stigma mechanisms. Evidence showed that PLWHA did not experience stigma and discrimination when they accessed services at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the largest hospital in Ghana. However, the situation was different when they accessed services at other public health facilities.

Testing hypotheses drawn from representative bureaucracy theory and using data from the second cohort of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, we find that when non-Caucasian caseworkers share the same racial/ethnic background as caregivers, caseworkers use more active strategies to connect caregivers to needed housing services. The relationship between racial/ethnic matching and frontline workers' repertoire of service strategies is most pronounced when the need for housing has been registered formally via referrals and case plans and thus legitimated institutionally. These results reinforce basic tenets of representative bureaucracy theory and provide evidence of the benefits of racial and ethnic diversity in the human service workforce.

It is recognized that online health information seeking (OHIS) is influenced by individuals' multi-dimensional factors, such as demographics, socio-economic factors, perceptions of the Internet, and health conditions. This study applies the conservation of resource theory to examine relationships between various multi-dimensional factors, daily challenges, and OHIS depending on individuals' health conditions. The data used in this study was taken from the U.S. Health Tracking Survey (2012). In this study, Internet users aged 18 and older were classified into patients (N = 518) and healthy people (N = 677) based on their health status related to chronic diseases. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between multi-dimensional factors (resources), self-rated health, and OHIS. Patients' various resources (e.g., age, income, education, having a smartphone, and health tracking) significantly predicted their self-rated health and OHIS; in addition, self-rated health significantly mediated the relationships between focal resources and OHIS.

Despite empirical research identifying risk correlates of school disengagement across the ecology, it is unclear from which domain these correlates arise. To redress this issue, the current study used intraclass correlation and DeFries-Fulker analyses to longitudinally decompose variance in three domains of engagement (academic, behavioral, and emotional) using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Findings suggest that nonshared environmental factors (that is, environmental contexts and experiences that are unique to each sibling) account for approximately half of the variance in indicators of school disengagement when controlling for genetic influences, and that this variance increases as adolescents grow older and rely less on their immediate family.

One particular attempt is Aarons's Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS), which measures a worker's attitudes toward adopting new treatments, interventions, and practices. This study follows Aarons's work by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis of the EBPAS administered in a large child and family human service agency in New York state (N = 1,273). Replicating Aarons et al.'s four-factor model of the EBPAS, the authors found that, within the model, the pattern of factor loadings that was apparent in previous investigations held for their data as well. That is, the factor loadings of items within the Divergence subscale were larger for items 5 and 7 and smaller for items 3 and 6. The authors found that both of their alternative models, one that added a residual covariance to items in the Divergence factor and a five-factor model that divided the Divergence factor into two factors, fit their data better than Aarons et al.'s model.

Focus group interviews of family caregivers were conducted to explore perspectives regarding the potential integration of Smart Wear technology into their family caregiving. Responses were analyzed qualitatively for themes related to perceptions of how Smart Wear could impact relationships between caregivers and care-recipients. Three major themes emerged: quality and quantity of interaction, boundary issues, and implications for anxiety. Implications and recommendations are discussed regarding maximizing the potential benefits of Smart Wear technology in ways that promote and protect healthy relationships among caregivers and care-recipients.",Implications of smart wear technology for family caregiving relationships: focus group perceptions.,2014,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Adolescents may come from family settings that heighten their vulnerability to early sexual initiation, promiscuity and sexual exploitation. Using qualitative data, we illustrated how early life and family circumstances including neglectful or dysfunctional parenting, sexual abuse, and unstable housing placed young women on a risk trajectory for HIV infection. Five representative cases from a sample of 26 adolescent and young adult HIV-infected females (ages 16-24) who participated in a study about the disease-related adaptive challenges they faced are discussed. Study participants were recruited from five New York City adolescent HIV clinics that provided comprehensive specialty medical and ancillary social services to adolescents and young adults with the disease. The findings revealed that these young women's unmet need for love, protection, and feeling valued left them vulnerable to exploitive relationships with men who were often significantly older and resulted in their HIV infection.",Early life circumstances as contributors to HIV infection.,2014,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Ethical decision making is critically important in hospice social work. Through in-depth interviews, researchers explored ethical dilemmas faced by 14 hospice social workers and the processes they used to move toward resolution. The dilemmas were integrated into a framework focused on the sources of ethical conflict: the client system, the agency, and the profession. Processes involved in resolving ethical dilemmas included consulting with other professionals, weighing the pros and cons of options, and bringing about desired outcomes. Findings suggest that hospice teams should be provided with opportunities to meaningfully discuss ethical decision making. Further, the involvement of social workers in administrative leadership is recommended to increase the likelihood that discipline-specific perspectives are incorporated into formal policies and procedures that shape practice in ethically complex situations.",Ethical dilemmas faced by hospice social workers.,2014,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study aims to examine poverty, chronic illnesses, health insurance, and health care expenditures, within the context of a political economy of aging perspective. Subsamples of 1,773 older adults from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were selected for analyses. The results showed that chronic illnesses influenced out-of-pocket health care costs. Older persons with more than one health insurance spent less on out-of-pocket health care costs. The results have implications for health care social workers concerned with the growing costs of chronic illnesses, implementing integrated care, and advocating for extending public health insurance coverage especially for our most impoverished older adults.","The impact of poverty, chronic illnesses, and health insurance status on out-of-pocket health care expenditures in later life.",2014,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Contemporary emphasis on measuring and evaluating observable, behavioral outcomes reflects a major change in the profession toward greater empirical basis for social work practice. This intellectual and methodological shift has created a gap between practitioners and researchers. While social work practitioners definitely should be more knowledgeable and receptive to interventions that have proven to be effective in helping people, social work academics must pay more attention to the realities of social work practitioners who struggle daily with expanding caseloads, ever-increasing time pressures to help clients whose lives are embedded in poverty, unemployment, oppression, racism, homelessness, and violence.",Engaging social work practitioners in research: challenges and opportunities.,2014,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Hospice family caregivers experience significantly higher rates of psychological distress than demographically similar noncaregivers. Interventions based on cognitive-behavioral therapy have been shown to reduce psychological distress in the general population by providing tools to modify thinking patterns that directly affect emotions and behavior. Such interventions might reasonably be incorporated into hospice social work; however, numerous contextual factors must be taken into account to ensure that any interventions are appropriate to the unique needs of clients. The purpose of the study discussed in this article was to contex- tualize one aspect of the cognitive-behavioral model based on firsthand accounts of hospice family caregivers. Following a modified grounded theory approach, researchers engaged in a secondary analysis of data from a larger study provided in a subsample of 90 audio-recorded conversations between hospice family caregivers and interventionists. Findings indicated that distressed caregivers engaged in five dominant thinking patterns: (1) &quot;should&quot; statements, (2) catastrophizing or minimizing, (3) personalizing, (4) absolute thinking, and (5) making assumptions. Implementing cognitive-behavioral therapies based on identified caregiver thinking patterns will allow hospice social workers to empower caregivers to cope more effectively with the numerous stressors they encounter while caring for a dying loved one.",Rethinking family caregiving: tailoring cognitive-behavioral therapies to the hospice experience.,2014,United States,Health Soc Work"Despite gains in reducing teenage pregnancy during the past 20 years, disparities in teenage pregnancy rates persist: The teenage pregnancy rate in Latino communities is now nearly double the average rate of teenage pregnancy in the United States. Considering the significant risks teenage pregnancy and parenting pose to both the teenager and the child, and that social workers are already often working in communities with populations at risk, this is not only a major public health issue, but one that the field of social work is well positioned to actively address.

At the University of Southern California, the number of graduate students selecting the health social work concentration has increased exponentially over the last five years. Although there are no published findings to indicate that other schools of social work are experiencing a similar trend, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that, nationally, the number of social workers employed in health care has increased and is projected to continue increasing over the next decade. The purpose of this study was to identify decision-making determinants of MSW students pursuing a specific vocational interest in health care settings. The study used a questionnaire to gather quantitative and qualitative data from a population of MSW students. The findings suggest that graduate students select the health concentration based on self-knowledge (abilities and interests) and vocational knowledge (job demands and labor market).

Results demonstrated significant associations between low-income women's self-reports of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse in childhood, and current and lifetime anxiety disorder, domestic violence, current posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, physical health or mental health issues, and any mental health diagnosis. These results build on previous research to paint a fuller picture of the associations between childhood abuse and physical and mental health for low-income women in Utah. Consistent with research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, findings suggest the applicability of conceptualizing childhood abuse as a public health issue. Social workers can play an integral role in promoting and implementing broader screening practices, connecting affected individuals with long-term interventions, and applying research findings to the design and provision of services within a public health model.",Physical and mental health correlates of adverse childhood experiences among low-income women.,2014,United States,Health Soc Work"In this study, similarities and differences in perinatal experiences between women with low socioeconomic status (SES) by race, ethnicity, and nativity were explored. The objective was to better understand the sociocultural and environmental contexts ofperinatal experiences and potential implications for screening and assessment among women with low SES. A purposive stratified sample of 32 women who were likely to be screened for perinatal depression participated in four focus groups organized by African American, white, Hmong, or Latina race or ethnicity. A descriptive study design was used to collect and evaluate focus-group data using qualitative content analysis. Women understood their perinatal experiences through the stressors in their environment. The stressors of insufficient socioeconomic resources and interpersonal support were relatively consistent across the focus groups. However, women's understanding of these stressors and their meaning differed between groups. Racially and ethnically diverse women with low SES experienced a complex interaction of sociocultural and environmental factors in the perinatal period.

This study examines the utility of this modality with the treatment of alcohol dependence and other forms of substance abuse. Toward this end, six focus groups (three therapist groups and three client groups) were conducted to identify the presumed benefits and limitations of using spiritually modified CBT in substance dependence treatment. In terms of benefits, spiritually modified CBT was perceived to enhance outcomes through operationalizing horizontal and vertical sources of social support, divine coping resources, and spiritual motivation. Potential challenges include the risk of therapists inadvertently imposing their own beliefs during the modification process and the possibility of offending clients when conflicts in belief systems emerge, particularly in group setting. The article concludes by providing suggestions for incorporating spiritually modified CBT into treatment and develops a number of illustrative examples of spiritually modified CBT self-statements.",Using spiritually modified cognitive-behavioral therapy in substance dependence treatment: therapists' and clients' perceptions of the presumed benefits and limitations.,2014,United States,Health Soc Work,What social workers need to know about the retirement income crisis.,2014,United States,Health Soc Work"The world that social work exists in is no longer defined by traditional physical settings and boundaries, such as schools, agencies, or even offices.

This assessment accounts for demographic and socioeconomic factors, as well as both direct and moderating effects of resilience resources (social/emotional support, life satisfaction, and sleep quality). Findings demonstrate (1) increasing trends of reported ACEs across younger cohorts, including time period shifts such as more prevalent family incarceration, substance abuse, and divorce, (2) significant bivariate as well as independent associations of ACEs with poor health within every cohort, controlling for multiple covariates (increasing trends in older age for physical health), and (3) robust patterns wherein resilience resources moderated ACEs, indicating buffering pathways that sustained into old age.

Suspected cases of abuse or neglect must be identified in real-time, during the child's short stay in the hospital, and the decision of whether or not to report the case, and to whom (law enforcement or welfare authorities), must be made. The recognition that effective treatment also demands the involvement of physicians led to the development of an intensive training program for hospital-pediatricians. The current study, based on in-depth interviews with the doctors who participated in the program and the social workers who work with them at 14 hospitals in Israel, examined the impact of the training on cooperation between the two groups, seeking to determine whether the doctors' increased familiarity with the social work profession enhanced team-work. Phenomenological analysis of the interviews revealed several themes, indicating greater collaboration between the doctors and social workers. However, the participants also noted increased friction between the two groups. Possible explanations and practical recommendations for enhancing the potential effectiveness of such collaborations are offered.

This research examined the prevalence and factors associated with IPSV among a sample of women recruited at the scene of police-involved intimate partner violence incidents (N = 432). Within this sample, 43.98 percent of participants reported experiencing IPSV; this includes 17.36 percent who reported sexual abuse and 26.62 percent who reported forced sex. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the factors related to sexual abuse and forced sex, controlling for victim and relationship characteristics. Compared with women not reporting IPSV, women who were sexually abused or forced into sexual intercourse were significantly more likely to experience strangulation, feelings of shame, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Women whose partners had forced sex were more likely to report that they had a child in common with their abusive partner; and that their partner was sexually jealous, had threatened to kill them, had stalked or harassed them, or caused them to have a miscarriage due to abuse. These findings can be used to better inform social work practitioners about the prevalence and nature of IPSV and the associated risk factors, and can assist in routine screening and intervention.",Factors related to sexual abuse and forced sex in a sample of women experiencing police-involved intimate partner violence.,2014,United States,Health Soc Work"Homeless young adults are one of this country's most vulnerable populations, and information surrounding issues of subjective well-being among this particularly diverse population is scarce.

Data were collected from 227 graduate students, using the Attitudes toward Health Care Teams (ATHCT) scale. Both social work and other health science students had positive attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration with regard to its ability to improve the quality of a patient's care. The results from hierarchical linear regression analyses demonstrated that female students, older students, and students with longer interprofessional practice experiences had more positive attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration in health care teams.

This proportion far exceeds the most optimistic coverage projections for adults under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The child health insurance safety net was crafted from 1982 to 1997 through several incremental, bipartisan federal and state legislative actions. It began by offering and later mandating state Medicaid eligibility expansions and culminated with the enactment of the State Child Health Insurance Program. Two-thirds of the states leveraged these laws to expand coverage beyond federal requirements. As a senior executive with the American Academy of Pediatrics, the author was directly involved or closely monitored these federal and state child health insurance expansions. This case study is a participant-observer analysis of that period, an era that stands in stark contrast to today's highly partisan times. The successive expansions of publicly funded children's health insurance during this conservative period, when many other human services programs were slashed, are attributed to public sympathy for children, political acceptability by the right and the left, manageable costs, and the relative ease of state implementation as these changes came in incremental pieces over several years.",How bipartisanship and incrementalism stitched the child health insurance safety net (1982-1997).,2014,United States,Health Soc Work"Georgia had the third highest 2010 repeat teenage birth rate in the United States and has had one of the worst rates for years. Since 2001, Georgia's Second Chance Home Network, administered by the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential, has provided housing and support to parenting teenagers--almost two-thirds of whom were in custody of and referred by Georgia's Department of Children and Family Services--to help them become nurturing and self-sufficient parents, to avoid repeat teenage pregnancies, and to promote healthy development of their children. Data were collected from each resident at intake, discharge, and three follow-up points at three, 12, and 24 months after discharge. Evaluation has consistently revealed improvements in several key outcomes, including education, housing, income, self-sufficiency, parenting, repeat pregnancy, and child outcomes. The 2012 evaluation revealed benefits in all these areas and found that those who stayed longer demonstrated better outcomes, especially related to the core outcomes of educational status, employment, and stable residence.

Such youths are often deprived of sexual health information across a range of potential sources, although school social workers are in a unique position to provide them services. Thirteen school social workers working primarily with adolescents with disabilities were interviewed using a phenomenological study design to offer their perspectives concerning the sexual and pregnancy experiences of such youths. Inductive content analysis revealed that school social workers provided services for pregnant and parenting adolescents with a range of disabilities in areas that included making decisions about sex, deciphering whether they were pregnant, and making decisions once they were pregnant. These experiences were complicated by cognitive impairments; emotional struggles; desires to fit in with peers; histories of sexual abuse; and issues with communication, self-esteem, and impulsivity.

Unlike other studies, the current study minimized selection bias by controlling for prior self-rated health, in addition to other predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need factors. We found that underemployment, but not unemployment, is associated with lower levels of self-rated health of single mothers. Results further indicate that the 25-39 age range (compared to the 18-24 age range), lower family income, prior lower self-rated health, more chronic diseases, and binge drinking place single mothers at an increased risk of lower levels of self-rated health. In contrast, strength-building physical activity is significantly associated with higher levels of self-rated health.

Additionally, HIV-specific health care providers were interviewed, to assess their knowledge of the sub-culture. House/ball members reported both positive and negative perceptions of treatment by their health care providers with respect to their house/ball involvement.

Two study phases that informed the EMESH intervention design are described. Phase I involved semi-structured interviews with 20 caretakers of infants diagnosed with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). In Phase II, 75 randomly selected medical records of infants with BPD were reviewed to explore the family demographics and staff behavior regarding environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) interventions. Interview results suggest that families are open to partnering with social workers and interdisciplinary team members in addressing infants' ETS exposure, families' unique circumstances indicate a need for tailored interventions, and the use of self-efficacy and decisional balance tools are feasible options. Results from the medical records review indicate that many families are economically vulnerable and reside in regions where smoking is common. There is a paucity of staff documentation regarding ETS conversations and interventions, indicating that these conversations may not take place. Together these results suggest a two-pronged approach in the next phases of EMESH: staff training in hosting and documenting ETS conversations and a tailored, parent-driven set of intervention options.",If mothers had their say: research-informed intervention design for empowering mothers to establish smoke-free homes.,2014,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Several studies demonstrated the importance of psychosocial factors, like social support, for understanding the experience of people with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

Aim of this qualitative study was to explore the experiences of problematic support from SLE patients' perspective. Nine women with SLE were interviewed and transcripts were analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Three main types of problematic social support were indentified. Oppressive support describes social support offers characterized by excessive worries and unwanted advices. Support denying the illness is characterized by a neglect of the disease or of its consequences. Support based on divergent illness representations is perceived as not punctual and not in line with patients' actual clinical condition.

The wide range of clinical interventions, implementation strategies, and outcomes evaluated precluded meta-analysis. However, the majority of studies (n = 7; 64%) found a statistically significant effect in the hypothesized direction for at least one implementation or clinical outcome.CONCLUSIONS: There is a clear need for more rigorous research on the effectiveness of implementation strategies, and we provide several suggestions that could improve this research area.",A Systematic Review of Strategies for Implementing Empirically Supported Mental Health Interventions.,2014,United States,Res Soc Work Pract"Social Work has a long history of community practice, but community practice models have been understudied. An important first step in conducting such studies is the establishment of psychometrically sound measures relevant for evaluations of community practice. In this paper, data are used from a community-randomized trial of Communities That Care (CTC), a coalition-based model of community practice shown to be effective at transforming communities and changing rates of youth problem behavior. Coalition functioning is reported by coalition members in 12 communities across intervention implementation phases. A four-dimensional model of coalition functioning (goal-directedness, efficiency, opportunities for participation, and cohesion) was confirmed using factor analysis and the dimensions were found to be invariant across time. One test of validity of these dimensions is conducted by correlating coalition members' ratings of coalition functioning with those of external observers.",Measuring Dimensions of Coalition Functioning for Effective and Participatory Community Practice.,2014,United States,Soc Work Res"A trustful patient-provider relationship is a strong predictor of positive outcomes, including treatment adherence and viral suppression, among patients with HIV/AIDS. Understanding factors that inform this relationship is especially relevant for Black patients, who bear a disproportionate burden of HIV morbidity and mortality, and may face challenges associated with seeing providers of a racial/ethnic background that is different from their own. Using data collected through the Enhancing Communication and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) study, we build upon extant research by examining patient and provider characteristics that may influence Black patients' trust in their provider. ECHO data were collected from four ambulatory care sites in Baltimore, Detroit, New York and Portland, Oregon (N=435). Regression analysis results indicate that trust in health care institutions and cultural similarity between patient and provider are strongly associated with patients' trust in their provider. Lower perceived social status, being currently employed, and having an older provider were also related to greater patient-provide trust. These findings can inform interventions to improve trust and reduce disparities in HIV care and outcomes that stem from mistrust among Black patients.","Race, Relationships and Trust in Providers among Black Patients with HIV/AIDS.",2014,United States,Soc Work ResThis paper examines the place of emotions within social work practice.

Psychosocial issues have an effect on diabetes self-care. Diabetes-related distress is associated with self-management and lower A1C. This cross-sectional study seeks to understand how demographic factors, psychological orientations, support, and diabetes management behaviors predict diabetes-related distress. This study uses data from 267 adults with Type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) is a 17-item scale measuring diabetes-related distress including emotional distress, physician-related distress, regimen distress, and interpersonal distress. Hierarchical regression was conducted in four stages. The final model explains 48% of the variance in DDS. Significant factors related to lower DDS were older age, lower body mass index, higher self-efficacy, higher levels of health care provider support, and a healthy diet. Findings of this study help health care providers know where to focus to reduce diabetes-related distress. Health care provider support is significant in reducing DDS.

One such area of expansion is the receipt of extended care services in the veteran's home environment. Social workers within PACT, also known as the patient-centered medical home, are tasked with movement of health care resources and care coordination centered around veterans in their residences. This presents social workers in the health care setting with new challenges for dealing with high burden and role strain for caregivers of veterans in noninstitutional settings who are dependent in performing activities of daily living.

The high operational tempo, length, and number of deployments-and greater in-theater exposure to threat-have resulted in well-documented psychological health concerns among service members and veterans. In addition, there is increasing and compelling evidence describing the significant deleterious impact of the deployment cycle on family members, including children, in military-connected families. However, rates of engagement and service utilization in prevention and intervention services continue to lag far below apparent need among service members and their families, because of both practical and psychological barriers. The authors describe the dynamic and ultimately successful process of engaging military families with young children in a home-based reintegration program designed to support parenting and strengthen parent-child relationships as service member parents move back into family life. In addition to the integration of existing evidence-based engagement strategies, the authors applied a strengths-based approach to working with military families and worked from a community-based participatory foundation to enhance family engagement and program completion.

Fourteen male service members, previously deployed to a combat zone, parent to at least one child under seven years of age, were interviewed about their relationships with their young children. Principles of grounded theory guided data analysis to identify key themes related to parenting young children after deployment. Participants reported significant levels of parenting stress and identified specific challenges, including difficulty reconnecting with children, adapting expectations from military to family life, and coparenting. Fathers acknowledged regret about missing an important period in their child's development and indicated a strong desire to improve their parenting skills. They described a need for support in expressing emotions, nurturing, and managing their tempers. Results affirm the need for support to military families during reintegration and demonstrate that military fathers are receptive to opportunities to engage in parenting interventions. Helping fathers understand their children's behavior in the context of age-typical responses to separation and reunion may help them to renew parent-child relationships and reengage in optimal parenting of their young children.",Fathering after military deployment: parenting challenges and goals of fathers of young children.,2014,United States,Health Soc Work"Research has shown that experiences ofmilitary sexual assault and harassment can have a negative impact on veterans' health and functioning, even years or decades later, thus clearly identifying this as an important area of concern for social workers.

To intervene effectively with this population, social workers must be knowledgeable about these issues and the cultural context within which they occur. Although schools of social work across the country are developing course work in military social work, little is known about the learning outcomes of these courses. This article describes a military social work course that was developed to increase student preparedness to work with a military or veteran population and the learning outcomes achieved. Using a quasi-experimental pre-post design, this study compared the learning outcomes of students enrolled in the course with a group of students who had not taken the course. To measure this knowledge, the authors developed a 50-item Military Social Work Knowledge Scale for the study.

In particular, we know little about the level and quality of parental investment that children receive across a range of contemporary family types. In this paper, we use data from a recent U.S. urban birth cohort to examine the 'package' of parental involvement that young children receive in two key domains across family types. We aggregate parent-child engagement across three potential parent(-figures)-biological mothers, biological fathers (resident or non-resident), and resident social fathers-and also assess the child's household income. We examine parental investments at child age 5 and changes in investments between child ages 1 and 5 by family structure categories. Overall, we find that children living with both of their married biological parents are advantaged with respect to both economic resources and parental engagement, while children living with single mothers-or their mother and a cohabiting social father-fare especially poorly in both domains; children in married social-father families receive higher overall levels of parental engagement than those in biological-father families but are much less economically advantaged.

This article reviews the Australian health care system and policies with particular emphasis on the public hospital system. It then examines current hospital social work roles, including the continued role in discharge planning and expanding responsibility for emerging client problems, such as patient complexity, legal, and carer issues.

A dataset containing all closed substance treatment episodes in NSW, Australia from July 2006 to June 2011 was used. Statistical analysis was used to determine any relationships between demographic and treatment variables and homelessness. Of the 213, 129 treatment episodes in the dataset 12.8% have some form of homelessness. Non-government and residential services have the highest prevalence of homelessness. Sex, age, and drug type have weak relationships with homelessness. Leaving against the advice of the treatment provider is more common in episodes where homelessness is a factor.

This study explored cross-cultural care from the health care provider perspective within two tertiary level Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). Fifty eight inter-professional health care providers (HCP) participated in focus groups. Participants identified perceived care-related experiences of newly immigrated parents whose infant received care in the NICU as well as health care provider perspectives on delivering that care. Results identified core processes of &quot;connection&quot; and &quot;disconnection,&quot; which appeared to have a substantial bearing on NICU experience and interaction. Connection comprised congruity, synergy, and &quot;fit,&quot; and resulted in an enhanced relationship between the family and HCP. Disconnection, in contrast, entailed a lack of &quot;fit&quot; and in some cases, misunderstanding and/or conflict between the family and a member or members of the health care team. Connection and disconnection occurred at various junctures of NICU care. These junctures reflected interaction between the family and HCP at the bedside and/or at the level of the unit, hospital, or community at large.

The purpose of this study was to use ethnographic interviews to investigate factors affecting communication satisfaction between social workers and pediatricians. The study found that scope of practice issues were a communication barrier.

The purpose of this study was to assess tobacco smoking cessation training in clinical social work programs. A valid 21-item questionnaire was sent to the entire population of 189 clinical graduate social work programs identified by the Council on Social Work Education. A three-wave mailing process was used to maximize the return rate. Directors from 112 clinical social work programs returned completed questionnaires (61 percent). The majority (91 percent) of directors reported having never thought about offering formal smoking cessation training, and only nine of the programs (8 percent) currently provided formal smoking cessation education. The three leading barriers to offering smoking cessation education were as follows: not a priority (60 percent), not enough time (55 percent), and not required by the accrediting body (41 percent). These findings indicate that clinical social work students are not receiving standardized smoking cessation education to assist in improving the well-being of their clients.

There are mixed findings regarding racial and ethnic differences in the use of CAM. This article explores racial and ethnic differences in use of a category of CAM known as mind-body techniques (MBT) among senior center participants with symptoms of depression. It also examines the relationship between use of MBT and depression severity. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a representative sample of senior center participants in New York City, from which a subsample of those with depressive symptoms was drawn. Racial and ethnic differences in MBT use were identified, as was a significant negative relationship between MBT use and depression severity. African American elders were more likely to have used MBT than other racial or ethnic groups. When controlling for race or ethnicity, health status, and barriers to medical care, predictors of depression severity included health status, experiencing barriers to medical care, and Hispanic identity. Findings suggest that being female or younger is associated with a higher likelihood of using CAM. Contrary to some prior research, education level was not associated with use of MBT.","Mind-body techniques, race-ethnicity, and depression among urban senior center participants.",2014,United States,Health Soc Work"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a leading cause of developmental disabilities. Children within the child welfare system are five to 10 times more likely than other children to experience these symptoms. Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) volunteers are uniquely positioned to identify these children and refer them for assessment and services. This study used a one-group pretest-posttest design to assess the impact of a three-hour online FASDs training on CASA workers' knowledge of FASDs and their comfort and confidence in identifying children with FASDs for referral, advocating for them, and linking them to services. The training and assessment measures were completed by 338 CASA volunteers and staff from 55 CASA locations in Texas. Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests and paired t tests were used to assess change in each of the dependent measures.

The aim of this article is to reveal the cyclic nature of this relationship: Concentrated urban poverty cultivates mental illness, while the resulting mental illness reinforces poverty. The authors used theories about social disorganization and crime to explore the mechanisms through which the urban environment can contribute to mental health problems. They present some data on crime, substance abuse, and social control to support their claim that mental illness reinforces poverty. The authors argue that, to interrupt this cycle and improve outcomes, social workers and policymakers must work together to implement a comprehensive mental health care system that emphasizes prevention, reaches young people, crosses traditional health care provision boundaries, and involves the entire community to break this cycle and improve the outcomes of those living in urban poverty.",Mental health and poverty in the inner city.,2014,United States,Health Soc Work"This article examines and unpacks the &quot;black box&quot; of cultural competence in health interventions with racial and ethnic minority populations. The analysis builds on several recent reviews of evidence-based efforts to reduce health disparities, with a focus on how cultural competence is defined and operationalized. It finds that the use of multiple similar and indistinct terms related to cultural competence, as well as the lack of a mutually agreeable definition for cultural competence itself, has resulted in an imprecise concept that is often invoked but rarely defined and only marginally empirically validated as an effective health intervention.

To systematically assess this issue, medical social workers may need to use a brief and valid measurement in their practice. In the Hong Kong Chinese context, one additional challenge is to examine whether a measurement developed in the West is valid for Hong Kong Chinese caregivers. Thus, medical social workers in Hong Kong initiated this research study to validate the Chinese version of the Modified Caregiver Strain Index (C-M-CSI). A total of 223 Chinese caregivers of patients with various chronic illnesses were recruited for this validation study. C-M-CSI demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = .91), concurrent validity with the Chinese version of the Caregiver Burden Inventory, and discriminant validity with the Chinese version of the Meaning in Life Questionnaire. Factor analysis yielded a single factor as the original M-CSI, which explained 49 percent of variance. Construct validity was shown by differentiating spousal and nonspousal caregivers, as well as caregivers of patients with and without behavioral problems.

Integrated behavioral health (IBH) holds promise for treating mild to moderate psychiatric disorders in a manner that more fully addresses the biopsychosocial spectrum of needs of individuals and families in primary care, and for reducing disparities in accessing behavioral health care. For behavioral health practitioners, IBH requires a shift to a brief, outcome-driven, and team-based model of care. Despite the fact that social workers comprise the majority of behavioral health providers in IBH settings, little research has been done to assess the extent to which social workers are prepared for effective practice in fast-paced primary care. We conducted a survey of social workers (N = 84) in IBH settings to assess the following: (1) Key competency areas for social work practice in IBH settings and (2) Self-rated preparedness for effective practice in IBH settings. Online snowball sampling methods were used over a period of 1 month.

This public health initiative is known as birth cohort (baby boomer) testing for HCV. The intent of birth cohort testing is to identify and mobilize undiagnosed HCV-infected persons into care and treatment. Subsequently, clinical social workers in health care settings can anticipate a substantial increase in the number of HCV-infected persons presenting for care and treatment. The purpose of this article is to inform clinical social workers in health care settings of HCV, the standard of care and treatment for HCV, and clinical dilemmas associated with HCV patient care.

Many individuals with mental illness participate in primary care clinics, such as Placer County Community Clinic (PCCC), which provides primary care and medication-only psychiatric services to low-income county residents. This qualitative study describes an augmented care program provided to this population at PCCC and explores participant experiences with that program. The augmented program consisted of a full-time social worker and part-time registered nurse working as a team to coordinate care between providers, and provide psychosocial education and illness management support. Previous studies have demonstrated that similar programs result in improved clinical outcomes for people with mental illness but have largely not included perspectives of participants in these pilot programs. This article includes participant reports about medical service needs, barriers, and beneficial elements of the augmented program. Medical service needs included the need to provide input in treatment and to be personally valued. Barriers ranged from doubts about provider qualifications to concerns about medication. Elements of the augmented care program that participants found beneficial were those involving care coordination, social support, and weight management support.",Mental health in primary care: perceptions of augmented care for individuals with serious mental illness.,2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This article details the evaluation of a clinical services program for teen mothers in the District of Columbia. The program's primary objectives are to prevent unintended subsequent pregnancy and to promote contraceptive utilization. We calculated contraceptive utilization at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after delivery, as well as occurrence of subsequent pregnancy and birth. Nearly seven in ten (69.5%) teen mothers used contraception at 24 months after delivery, and 57.1% of contraceptive users elected long-acting reversible contraception. In the 24-month follow-up period, 19.3% experienced at least one subsequent pregnancy and 8.0% experienced a subsequent birth. These results suggest that an integrated clinical services model may contribute to sustained contraceptive use and may prove beneficial in preventing subsequent teen pregnancy and birth.",Evaluation of an integrated services program to prevent subsequent pregnancy and birth among urban teen mothers.,2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The need to train health social workers to practice interprofessionally is an essential goal of social work education. Although most health social workers have exposure to multidisciplinary practice within their field work, few social work education programs incorporate interprofessional learning as an integrated component of both course work and field experiences (McPherson, Headrick, &amp; Moss, 2001; Reeves, Lewin, Espin, &amp; Zwaranstein, 2010; Weinstein, Whittington, &amp; Leiba, 2003). In addition, little is written about the kinds of curricula that would effectively promote interdisciplinary training for social work students. These findings are particularly puzzling since there is increasing and compelling evidence that interdisciplinary training improves health outcomes (IOM, 2001). This article describes a social work education program that incorporates an Interprofessional education and leadership curriculum for Maternal and Child Health Social Work (MCHSW) at the University of Maryland's School of Social Work.

It relies on longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study. Findings from analyses of these data suggest that child support arrears result in declines in average weeks worked in the formal labor market in subsequent time periods. These findings are driven by the behaviors of fathers who had relatively high amounts of arrears and no income in the previous year and are mostly robust to tests for selection into no work or low levels of work by fathers. Findings also suggest that arrears obligations that are low relative to income result in increases in the probability that fathers engage in any formal work. Arrears are not statistically significantly related to informal labor force participation. This study highlights both intended and unintended consequences of the growth in arrears under current child support enforcement policies.,Falling Further Behind?

California Health Interview Survey data of foreign-born respondents aged 65 and over were used to examine the four outcomes of health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The study included 1,196 immigrant Latinos, Asians, and non-Hispanic Whites. The results show that ethnicity/race-based differences in HRQOL exist. Furthermore, the results indicate that English proficiency has a significant moderating relationship on racial/ethnic background. The likelihood of reporting more Limited Combined Days increased with lower levels of English proficiency for both Latino and Asian-American old adults as compared to non-Hispanic Whites. In addition to focusing on racial disparities, health promotion efforts with older immigrants need to examine language-based stratification.

In-depth interviews were conducted on 10 students living with sickle cell anemia and eight were conducted on the health workers. To explain the sufferers view and experience, interpretative phenomenology approach was employed. Findings were that sufferers experience much pain and crisis. Their coping strategies include having plenty of rest and water, avoiding strenuous activities and taking their medications. They had a good knowledge of the disease but faced the challenges of combining caring for themselves and academic pursuit which create problems of adherence and finance for buying drugs and sponsoring their education at the same time. In conclusion, sufferers were coping well but there was still a need to address the problems of harsh university environment, finance and adherence.","Coping with sickle cell anemia in Nigerian universities: the case of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria.",2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This research explores health care professionals' understanding of the problems that arise in managing a terminal condition impacting the Latino population and conceptualizes the components of patient advocacy that address gaps in end-of-life care for patients and their family members.

Forty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with providers from different disciplines including medicine, nursing, social work, and chaplaincy. Although roles and responsibilities vary among health providers, it is imperative that all providers become aware of the need for patient advocacy. Doing so is not only in the best interest of vulnerable Latino populations but also has overarching financial benefits and positive outcomes for patients, administrators, and public health care systems.

The aim of the current qualitative, retrospective study is to examine the experiences, challenges, and difficulties faced by Israeli parents during the outbreak of psychiatric illness in their children. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 parents who participated in a psycho-educational group in a family mental health center. Several themes regarding parents' experience of the first outbreak of their children's psychiatric illness emerge from the content analysis of the interviews--the perception of sudden onset of the illness, feelings of being mired in distress, intense pain stemming from guilt and helplessness with concomitant anger, and isolation. The themes are then discussed in light of the concept of ambiguous loss and the existential approach.

During the initial six weeks (phase I), patients were referred for psychosocial services by clinic staff. During the second six weeks (phase II), a nurse introduced available services to each patient with a brochure. During the final 12 weeks (phase III), a social worker introduced services to each patient. The authors then compared psychosocial service referral rates. The sample included 196 patients. During phase III, the probability of a patient-initiated referral increased 3.4-fold (95 percent confidence interval [CI] [1.1, 10.4], p = .04) compared with baseline; the probability of any referral rose 2.7-fold (95 percent CI [1.1, 6.3], p = .03). The mean time to referral decreased from 79.4 days at baseline to 3.9 days during phase III (p &lt; .001). The phase III intervention was accomplished only in 34 patients (39 percent) because of scheduling conflicts.

The sample was extracted from a national data set. Results of multinomial logistic regression showed that use of social work services was increased by dual diagnosis, substance use disorder alone, and mental disorder alone; by deteriorating mental health; by perceived stigma in treatment use; by welfare receipt and insurance coverage for mental health services; and by college graduation. Results also showed that use of services outside social work was promoted by dual diagnosis, substance use disorder alone, and mental disorder alone; by deteriorating mental health; by experience of racial discrimination; by insurance coverage for mental health services; by college education or graduation; and by female gender and increasing age.

Therefore, an early diagnosis of cognitive impairment is important. However, patients are often admitted to a hospital only when they already have a serious cognitive impairment. Consequently, cooperative studies between clinics and community-based organizations may assist hospitals in detecting early cognitive impairment. This article examines how community-based organizations can contribute to the early diagnosis of dementia. A cooperation model between the Neurology Department of Mersin University Hospital and the Mersin branch of the Alzheimer's Association was developed. Trained professionals used a neuropsychological battery to evaluate 50 individuals at the Mersin branch of the Alzheimer's Association in Turkey. Individuals whose performance fell below the average (1 standard deviation or less) were subsequently referred to the hospital. On the basis of the neurological and neuropsychological assessments, 11 participants were placed in the mild cognitive impairment group and 39 were placed in the healthy group. The results suggest that the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination and the Three Words-Three Shapes Test are useful tools for detecting early memory impairments in a community-based setting.",Detection of memory impairment in a community-based system: a collaborative study.,2013,United States,Health Soc Work"Workplace violence is a serious and surprisingly understudied occupational hazard in social service settings.

The study gathered general descriptions of each agency and compiled incidence data on workplace violence that were collected by agencies in fiscal year 2009. The key findings of this descriptive study showed high rates of workplace violence against social services providers and a pattern of risk disparity, with significantly more risk for direct care versus clinical staff. These results are based on data routinely collected by social service agencies that typically remain unexamined.

The social workers in this study received extensive didactic and experiential CBT training. Audio-taped sessions were randomly selected and evaluated independently. Results showed that the social workers adequately delivered CBT as measured by the Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTS). Older adult participants also evidenced pre-post treatment improvements suggesting that the social workers' delivery of CBT facilitated improvement.

In addition, mTBI has affected thousands of soldiers returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Many individuals experience post-concussive symptoms immediately after mTBI; some experience severe and prolonged symptoms. Symptom etiology is not well understood, and effective psychosocial interventions have not been well developed. Because of the high incidence of mTBI, many social workers in health care settings will come in contact with mTBI patients and need specialized knowledge to provide appropriate services. Social work researchers can contribute to improved services by elucidating symptom course, and developing and testing effective interventions aimed at preventing or alleviating symptoms.

Black women with intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences (nâ€‰=â€‰431) were recruited from primary care, prenatal or family planning clinics in the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Severity of IPV was significantly associated with co-occurring MH problems, but was not associated with the use of MH resources among African-American women. Risk for lethality and co-occurring problems were also not significantly related to the use of resources. African Caribbean women with severe physical abuse experiences were significantly less likely to use resources. In contrast, severity of physical abuse was positively associated with the use of resources among Black women with mixed ethnicity. Severe IPV experiences are risk factors for co-occurring MH problems, which in turn, increases the need for MH services. However, Black women may not seek help for MH problems. Thus, social work practitioners in health care settings must thoroughly assess women for their IPV experiences and develop tailored treatment plans that address their abuse histories and MH needs.","Intimate partner violence, depression, PTSD, and use of mental health resources among ethnically diverse black women.",2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Research on the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and postpartum depression (PPD) is limited.

Many aspects of disadvantaged urban contexts have the potential to thwart successful youth development. Adolescents with elevated mental health needs may experience impaired judgment, poor problem-solving skills, and conflictual interpersonal relationships, resulting in unsafe sexual behavior and drug use. However, mental health services are frequently avoided by urban adolescents who could gain substantial benefit from care. Thus, the development of culturally sensitive, contextually relevant and effective services for urban, low-income African American and Latino adolescents is critical. Given the complexity of the mental health and social needs of urban youth, novel approaches to service delivery may need to consider individual (i.e., motivation to succeed in the future), family (i.e., adult support within and outside of the family), and community-level (i.e., work and school opportunities) clinical components. Step-Up, a high school-based mental health service delivery model has been developed to bolster key family, youth and school processes related to youth mental health and positive youth development. Step-Up (1) intervenes with urban minority adolescents across inner-city ecological domains; (2) addresses multiple levels (school, family and community) in order to target youth mental health difficulties; and (3) provides opportunities for increasing youth social problem-solving and life skills. Further, Step-Up integrates existing theory-driven, evidence-based interventions.

The purpose of this study was to elicit solutions to participation barriers from African Americans and Latinos. Fifty-seven adults (32 African Americans, 25 Latinos) ages 50 years and older participated. The Institute of Medicine's Unequal Treatment conceptual framework was used. Six racially/ ethnically homogenous focus groups were conducted at five sites in three counties. Themes within groups and cross-cutting themes were identified. The NVIVO program was used for data classification. The data were reviewed for final coding and consensus. Shared solutions included addressing costs, recruiting in community contexts, conducting community and individualized patient education, and sharing patient safety information. Participants were unanimously in favor of clinical trials navigation recruitment interventions. Solutions specific to African Americans included diversifying research teams, recognizing past research abuses, and increasing community trust. Solutions specific to Latinos included providing low-literacy materials, providing Spanish-speaking clinicians and advocates, and clarifying that immigration status would neither be documented nor prevent participation. Solutions from African Americans and Latinos reflect their cultural backgrounds and historical experiences.

There were significant improvements in the domains of work, finance, leisure, social life, living situation, personal safety and health by 3 months. There were highly significant correlations between psychosocial improvements and improved depression scores.",A social work contribution to suicide prevention through assertive brief psychotherapy and community linkage: use of the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA).,2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Elderly patients presenting to St. Vincent's Health Emergency Department (ED) constitute approximately one third of presentations. A significant proportion of these involve preexisting conditions including depression that, within elderly patients, is associated with social isolation, physical and mental health problems, and barriers to accessing community services. It is also often overlooked as a clinical diagnosis among the elderly. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a brief depression screening tool and examine the change over time in quality of life and social factors for elderly patients who present to ED. Patients aged 65 years and over were screened for depression using a short form of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Participants were randomized into control (usual care) and intervention (an assertive outreach community management program) groups and assessed in relation to depression, quality of life, and social support/functioning at recruitment and 6 weeks post discharge. Approximately one in four participants experienced mild to moderate depression that was related to medical factors and associated reduced mobility. This study suggests that an assertive outreach program, with the inclusion of community intervention and links to social supports and services, could improve the management of depression in the elderly and associated health outcomes.","Caring for depressed elderly in the emergency department: establishing links between sub-acute, primary, and community care.",2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The complex interrelationship between depressive disorders and chronic disease has significant implications for both chronic disease management and the treatment of depression.

Participants included 30 MI patients who were admitted to St. Vincent's Health in Melbourne. A repeated measures mixed measures methodology was used to examine demographic information, depressive symptomatology, physical and emotional wellbeing, and social functioning during hospitalization and at 3 and 6 months post discharge. Participants demonstrated severe depression at initial assessment but this reduced significantly post discharge. Depression at initial assessment aligned with reports of intense fear of increased mortality. The reduction in depression scores at 3 and 6 months aligned with emotional management of the crisis and improvements in general health, and physical and social functioning. The majority of patients did not participate in community rehabilitation, naming informal supports as the most significant. These results lend support to the use of crisis intervention and empowerment strategies as key elements of cardiac rehabilitation programs, to improve physical functioning and attend to depressive symptomatology in a proactive way, to improve secondary risk prevention among young patients who experience an MI event.",The contribution of psychosocial factors to secondary risk prevention for myocardial infarction in young adults.,2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Awareness about the specific needs of Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) aged 15-25 with a diagnosis of cancer has grown rapidly over the past 10 years. To improve outcomes for these patients it is essential that services are developed within youth friendly models. This requires awareness by healthcare professionals of unique biological, genetic, epidemiological, psychological, social, and cultural factors that affect the AYA population. This study sought to explore oncology professionals understanding of the healthcare preferences of AYAs with cancer receiving treatment at a specialist cancer centre. Participants comprised 60 professionals in allied health (n = 15); nursing (n = 32); oncology (n = 6) and those from the Victorian AYA Cancer Service (n = 7). A questionnaire, developed from pilot work, collected demographic information, investigated professionals' top five perceived issues for AYAs, and examined perceptions in the areas of communication; information provision; environment; services; education, employment and social life, fertility and sexuality; support and survivorship. Results illustrate that, with a strong focus on survival and physical wellbeing, professionals significantly underestimate the breadth of AYA psychosocial concerns. The findings further indicate: that young people report different healthcare preferences compared to those reported by professionals; there are varying levels of professional skill, experience and confidence; there are significant workforce development and support needs for professionals; and AYA models of care require rigorous evaluation to ensure the improvement of outcomes for young people living with cancer.",An exploratory study of oncology specialists' understanding of the preferences of young people living with cancer.,2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Little is known about the experience of Chinese migrants to Australia who are caring for a person with schizophrenia.

Of those who do, about 70% do not return after the initial visit. This study's purposes were: (1) to identify factors that led non-U.S.-born Latinos to utilize services from a nonprofit clinic in Texas and (2) to assess whether acculturation played a role in accessing mental health care. Data were collected over a 10-week period using an interview schedule and the Bidimensional Acculturation Scale for Latinos. Results indicate acculturation does not play a significant role in access, but patient knowledge of mental health care issues does. Specifically, the main barriers to access were: (1) lack of knowledge that there was a mental health issue; and (2) lack of knowledge of where to go for mental health services.",What leads non-U.S.-Born Latinos to access mental health care?,2013,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Live kidney transplantation (LKT) is underused by patients with end-stage renal disease. Easily implementable and effective interventions to improve patients' early consideration of LKT are needed. The Talking About Live Kidney Donation (TALK) social worker intervention (SWI) improved consideration and pursuit of LKT among patients with progressive chronic kidney disease in a recent randomized controlled trial: Patients and their families were invited to meet twice with a social worker to discuss their self-identified barriers to seeking LKT and to identify solutions to barriers. The authors audio recorded and transcribed all social worker visits to assess implementation of the TALK SWI and its acceptability to patients and families. The study social worker adhered to the TALK SWI protocol more than 90 percent of the time. Patients and families discussed medical (for example, long-term risks of transplant), psychological (for example, patients' denial of the severity of their disease), and economic (for example, impact of donation on family finances) concerns regarding LKT. Most patients and families felt that the intervention was helpful. Consistently high adherence to the TALK SWI protocol and acceptability of the intervention among patients and families suggest that the TALK SWI can be feasibly implemented in clinical practice.",Feasibility and acceptability of the TALK social worker intervention to improve live kidney transplantation.,2013,United States,Health Soc Work"Medicare Part D was enacted to help elderly and disabled individuals pay for prescription drugs, but it was structured with a gap providing no coverage in 2010 between $2,830 and $6,440. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are especially likely to be affected due to high costs of dialysis-related drugs and the importance of adherence for overall health. Researchers from social work, pharmacy, and dietetics interviewed 12 patients with ESRD to learn about strategies and challenges during the coverage gap. Constant comparison generated the following themes: the experience of hitting the gap, management strategies, physical and emotional consequences, and advice for others. Results suggest that patients could benefit from greater involvement with professionals and peers to prepare for and manage their medications during the coverage gap and for support in dealing with emotional consequences and stress related to financial pressures and living with a serious health condition.",How end-stage renal disease patients manage the Medicare Part D coverage gap.,2013,United States,Health Soc Work"Native Hawaiian women have the highest breast cancer incidence and mortality rates when compared with other large ethnic groups in Hawai'i.

This project explored the feasibility and effects of a culturally tailored educational intervention designed to build family capacity by improving the knowledge and skills of the woman and her family in dealing with breast cancer, particularly in the latter stage of recovery care. Twenty-nine Native Hawaiian women with breast cancer, along with a close family member, were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 15) or a wait-list control group (n = 14). The authors assessed the knowledge, self-efficacy, and coping skills of women and their family members and the recovery care behaviors of the women at baseline and at four months (after the intervention or control period). The intervention group made significant improvements in self-efficacy and coping; the wait-list control group did not.

Six focus group interviews were conducted with a total of 30 people with SMI, who were participants in a healthy lifestyle intervention. Separate focus groups were conducted for high and low achievers in the program based on clinically significant weight loss or significant increase in fitness. Thematic analysis revealed that social support for diet and exercise was a perceived benefit to involving others in a healthy lifestyle program. Other perceived benefits were the potential to increase others' understanding of the challenges of living with mental illness and to enhance the quality of relationships. Participants identified practical and logistical concerns that could interfere with participation, including partner reliability and desirability, scheduling, and lack of financial resources. Participants in the high achiever group expressed a greater desire to involve others in exercise than did participants in the low achiever group. Programs aimed at helping people with SMI make lifestyle changes may increase their effectiveness by involving significant others.

METHOD: This study compared the culture and climate scores of a large organization's programs that use ESTs and those programs indicating no EST usage. RESULTS: Of the total 55 different programs (1,273 frontline workers), 27 programs used ESTs. Results indicate that the programs offering an EST had significantly more rigid and resistant cultures, compared to those without any ESTs. In regard to climate, programs offering an EST were significantly less engaged, less functional, and more stressed.

This study used a nationally representative sample of 35,248 women from India between the ages of 15 and 49 who had given birth in the past five years to understand the effect of women's empowerment on developing blindness during pregnancy. Findings from logistic regression showed that several empowerment-related factors, including women's increased age at the birth of their first child, high school education, and participation in their own health care decisions, significantly reduced the odds of developing blindness, whereas their experience of spousal control, humiliation, and physical abuse significantly increased the odds of developing blindness during pregnancy. Interestingly, antenatal care visits that included nutritional advice and iron supplements during pregnancy had no effect on blindness after controlling for other factors. To reduce blindness during pregnancy in India, more attention should be given to delaying age at marriage and first birth; improving women and girl's education and autonomy; and implementing strategies to reduce spousal control, humiliation, and abuse.",Social factors determining the experience of blindness among pregnant women in developing countries: the case of India.,2012,United States,Health Soc Work"This study explored key aspects of resident transitions to assisted living (AL), including the frequency and importance of preadmission resident education and the potential role of social workers in this setting. To examine the factors that may help or hinder resident transitions to AL, a written survey was administered to a statewide, geographically representative purposive sample of Medicaid Assisted Living Waiver providers (N = 28). Findings suggest a positive relationship between the availability of a social worker and the frequency and importance of resident preadmission education in several areas. Results also suggest a gap between what AL providers believe is important for resident transitions and what is actually happening in their facilities. Social workers may play a significant role in providing preadmission education and are well positioned to address the unmet psychosocial needs of residents and family members during the transition to AL.

A national sample of 1,140 counselors in private SUD treatment settings completed a mailed survey. Overall, counselors perceive both motivational interviewing (MI) and contingency management (CM) to be effective and acceptable interventions, with MI perceived to be both more effective and more acceptable than CM. The results of this study also shed light on the factors associated with perceptions of effectiveness and acceptability of MI and CM. The results of this study underscore the importance of exposure to EBPs in the development of positive attitudes toward and use of EBPs. In particular, professional networks are an important route to introduce social workers to EBPs, as is professional training on specific EBPs.

Aggressive tactics to avoid condom use was measured using an adapted version of the revised Sexual Experiences Survey (Abbey et al., 2005) and assessed a variety of aggressive behaviors spanning coercion to physical force. 100 participants (35.3%) reported at least one instance of coercion or aggression to avoid using a condom. Structural equation modeling indicated that, attitudes towards women, inconsistent condom use, and number of sexual partners were significant predictors of aggressive tactics to avoid condom use.

However, although these behaviors appear in other cultures, little is known about the development of these problems among adolescents in countries other than the U.S.. This study contributes to our understanding of personality and parenting factors associated with adolescent problem behaviors using an international sample. Data are from a NIDA-funded study of 884 community-dwelling adolescents in Santiago, Chile (Mean age=14, SD=1.4, 48% females) of mid-to-low socioeconomic status. Results revealed that rule-breaking and aggressive behaviors were both associated with greater levels of adolescent drive but lower levels of parental monitoring and positive parenting by both parents. Adolescents who reported more attention problems were more likely to exhibit driven behavior, more behavioral inhibition, to report lower levels of parental monitoring, and positive parenting by mother and father. Results of interactions revealed that the influences of positive parenting and parental monitoring on adolescent aggressive behaviors varied as a function of the gender of the adolescent.

The author found in an Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis that the CD4 t-cell count, receipt of advice or support from church pastor, annual household income, and employed were all negatively related to seropositive mothers' perceived stress scores. Conversely, the need to have borrowed money from family members or friends to help pay for over-the-counter products like nutritional drinks, vitamins, or minerals was found to be positively related to these scores. The accessibility of these over-the-counter products could not only help to lower seropositive mothers' perceived stress levels but also potentially improve the functioning of their body's immune system.

Seven themes on reproductive attitudes and behaviors among people with SCD or SCT emerged: lack of awareness or education about SCD and SCT; men who deny having SCT; attitudes toward learning one's SCT status; rationales for learning a partner's SCT status prior to commencing a relationship; valuing relationships over SCD risk; learning one's own and partner's SCT status; and the consequences of not asking about partners' SCT status.

Consequently, the program proposes recovery through the adoption of a lifestyle that leads to physical, spiritual, and emotional well-being. A qualitative phenomenological study that focused on the emotional recovery of OA members was conducted. Personal narratives were obtained through semistructured in-depth interviews. It was found that the tools used for spiritual and emotional work at OA are essential to recovery. Furthermore, the experience of secure attachment is likely to occur within OA when safe ground is provided and positive attachment figures are accessible. These safe ground and positive attachment figures facilitate a corrective emotional experience that compensates for a childhood recollected in terms of rejection and time spent with a caregiver who lacked the emotional availability required for the creation of a secure attachment.

This small randomized study evaluated whether motivational interviewing (MI) affects adherence to and personal experience in an exercise program. Inactive people with MS participating in an eight-week exercise program were randomized to either three brief MI (n = 7) or three health coaching (n = 6) sessions. Session attendance for both conditions was high, and MI fidelity was rigorously and reliably measured using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity Scales. The feasibility of using this approach was demonstrated with a small sample. Large effects favoring the MI condition were found for physical exertion, affect during exercise, and fatigue, but no effects were found for adherence to the exercise program. Treatment integrity measures of MI were correlated with outcomes in expected directions. Although this study demonstrated the feasibility of this MI approach, the large effect sizes found should be viewed with substantial skepticism and replicated in sufficiently powered studies using objective measures of exercise adherence.",Motivational interviewing may improve exercise experience for people with multiple sclerosis: A small randomized trial.,2012,United States,Health Soc Work"This research explored the possible role of social work alongside emergency ambulance services. An ethnographic study included semistructured interviews and direct observations collected over 300 hours while riding in ambulances in an urban setting. The data suggest that social work could play a role by providing needed psychosocial care during ambulance calls. Emergency personnel were often consumed by the medical crises and further constrained by the perceived narrow parameters of their work roles.

The aim of the current study was to examine the intentions of students from various fields to work with individuals with DD. A questionnaire was completed by 512 social work, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, special education, and nursing students in Israel to measure students' attitudes toward working with individuals with DD, as well as their perceptions of subjective norms, controllability, and self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling showed that the students' intentions to work with individuals with DD were predicted by their attitudes and perceptions of subjective norms. Controllability was found to negatively affect their behavioral intentions. Furthermore, social work and nursing students were found to have the lowest behavioral intentions. Given the lack of education in the field of DD and the prevailing stigmatic attitudes toward this population, university programs should focus on increasing knowledge, promoting positive contact, and reducing the fear attached to working with people with DD.",Intention to work with individuals with dual diagnosis: testing the theory of planned behavior among students from various professions.,2012,United States,Health Soc Work"American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) experience some of the greatest health inequities of any group within the United States.

In light of the collective orientation of Chinese culture, an others-focused illness coping pattern named &quot;symptoms-related social hypervigilance&quot; (SSH) was constructed and explored together with SC in the current study. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey with 309 IBS patients recruited by 100% consecutive sampling was conducted. Exploratory factor analysis on the SSH scale provided a 9-item 3-factor solution. The three factors were 1) Anticipating negative perceptions from others; 2) Hiding symptoms in social situations; and 3) Assuming responsibility for total symptoms control. SC showed partial mediator properties between IBS symptoms severity and lowered health-related quality of life. Whereas SSH did not show similar mediating effects, it was associated with 'proactive' illness behaviors which, if excessive, can lead to relentless pursuit of total symptoms elimination.",Symptoms catastrophizing versus social hypervigilance in irritable bowel syndrome patients.,2012,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Cerebrovascular diseases are a public health and social policy priority in Europe due to their high prevalence and the long-term disability they may result in (as the principal cause of handicap). Increasingly, family caregivers take over the care at home of these patients. Two years post-stroke, our study analyzed the feelings of family caregivers from Luxembourg and northeastern Portugal toward their experience of caregiving and its repercussions on social and couple relationships, life satisfaction, and socioeconomic characteristics. Participating hospitals identified survivors and consent was sought by letter. Patients (n = 62) and their main caregivers (n = 46 pairs) were interviewed at home. The mean life satisfaction of caregivers was similar, but the experience of providing care differed in terms of family support, and disruptions of the caregivers' family responsibilities. More Portuguese respondents gave activities up, found little time for relaxation, and estimated that their health had deteriorated; more Luxembourgers felt strong enough to cope. More Portuguese spouses reported an impact on their sex lives.

The latest wave of data was collected during the Great Recession, the worst recession since the Great Depression, providing a unique opportunity to look at how high unemployment rates affect the well-being of low income families. We find that the unemployment rate is associated with increased overall material hardship, difficulty paying bills, having utilities disconnected, and with increased usage of TANF, SNAP, UI and Medicaid.

The purpose of this study was to systematically review the available literature on female patients with CF and their knowledge of sexual and reproductive health. A priori, the research question was posed: What deficits in sexual and reproductive health knowledge exist among women with cystic fibrosis? Three broad areas of knowledge lacking in female patients with CF were identified: physiological, genetic, and psychosocial. The results imply female patients with CF are not equipped with adequate information for the decision-making process involved in sexual and reproductive choices. Social workers play an important and dynamic role on the multidisciplinary CF care team and can improve the quality of life for women with CF by addressing the psychosocial processes associated with the disease.

Studies on the well-being and mothering challenges of adolescents in Nigeria have focused on the general poor well-being of adolescent mothers rather than exploring their agency and subjective well-being within specific context. This study explores adolescent mothers' (13-20 years) subjective well-being by focusing on their childbirth, mothering experiences, and available network of supports. Thirty face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted through the support of four informants and peer referrals. Content analysis was used to identify salient themes and patterns. Findings showed that a high proportion of the adolescent mothers had stigmatizing experiences among which include dropping out of school, and lack of supports from families, friends, and the society. Where available, supports were perceived as inadequate in contributing to their well-being and that of their children. Some of the adolescent mothers were apprehensive of losing their children to ill health while emphasizing that their present challenges could affect their children's future. However, the adolescent mothers invoked their agency by subtly using strategies such as petty trading and apprenticeship to reduce the social consequences of unintended pregnancy and earn a living.

The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term effectiveness of a brief patient education intervention aimed at increasing levels of disaster preparedness among families of special health care needs children. One hundred twenty-one families were randomly assigned to either intervention or intervention plus incentive group. Families were surveyed prior to the intervention using a previously published instrument on family preparedness, and at 30-45 days post-intervention. A Preparedness Score was assigned to each family based on the number of items completed on the preparedness instrument. Significant differences were found between pre- and posttest scores for families that received the intervention, regardless of whether or not an incentive item was provided.

Participants were assessed for smoking behavior and coping skills during, at end of treatment, and at posttreatment follow-up.RESULTS: Smoking rates and craving for nicotine were significantly lower for the VRST group compared to NRT-only group at the end of treatment. Self-confidence and coping skills were also significantly higher for the VRST group, and number of cigarettes smoked was significantly lower, compared to the control group at follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Feasibility of VRST was supported in the current study.",A Feasibility Study of Virtual Reality-Based Coping Skills Training for Nicotine Dependence.,2012,United States,Res Soc Work Pract"The purpose of the current study was to examine social work student attitudes toward the social work profession's perspective on certain aspects of reproductive health in the United States: contraception, emergency contraception, and the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Students at a large, public, land grant university were surveyed to determine whether their personal attitudes were in line with the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) stance on reproductive health outlined in the NASW policy statement on family planning and reproductive health. The relationship between levels of religious activity and attitudes toward these aspects of reproductive health was also examined. Results suggest that almost all of the respondents support public funding for family planning. Furthermore, almost all students indicate willingness to refer clients for general contraception. However, results related to emergency contraception indicate that 72% of students disagree that it should be available for adolescents over the counter, even with parental consent, which is inconsistent with the NASW perspective. Sixty-four percent of students report believing that the HPV vaccine is unsafe. Further, as levels of religious activity increased, acceptance of some of these aspects of reproductive health decreased. Implications for social work practice, education, and directions for future research are discussed.",Social work student attitudes toward contraception and the HPV vaccine.,2012,United States,Soc Work Health CareThis study reports on the effectiveness of a community-based senior outreach program in decreasing rehospitalizations and emergency department visits among chronically ill seniors. Participants had been repeatedly hospitalized with chronic illnesses and were subsequently served in an in-home program designed to address their psychosocial and medical needs. Participation in the program was found to be related to lower hospital readmission rates and emergency department usage. Clients also reported decreased financial concerns and depression and anxiety and increased social support. The study adds to the growing body of work supporting community-based programs as effective strategies for decreasing health care usage and improving quality of life for chronically ill seniors.,The efficacy of a senior outreach program in the reduction of hospital readmissions and emergency department visits among chronically ill seniors.,2012,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The objective of this study is to gain a deeper understanding of the use of traditional and modern medicine among older adult women living in rural Bangladesh. Factors are identified that guide the women's decisions about who to seek help from when they are ill. The findings provide evidence that, in spite of the availability of modern health care, traditional healers--faith-based and herbalists--are widely utilized. Reasons given for their choice of health care providers fall into two categories: belief in the effectiveness of the intervention and service delivery considerations. These data suggest that use of traditional healers persists among women in rural areas of Bangladesh and that health policy should be developed with an acknowledgment of these health practices.",In search of healing between two worlds: the use of traditional and modern health services by older women in rural Bangladesh.,2012,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The needs of hospitalized male patients are often unrecognized and unmet. Men occupy greater than half of all inpatient hospital beds and incur a broad array of illnesses and injuries at higher rates than women--yet often receive health care that pays surprisingly little attention to the concept of patient masculinity, or to masculinity's influence on the male patient's perspectives, behaviors, goals, interests, needs, and challenges. Little emphasis is placed on considering hospitalized male patients as men , understanding their need for patient-centered care within this context, and intervening in ways that regularly allow strengths to be adequately recognized and utilized. In this article, we explore how hospital social workers can reconsider masculinity as a vibrant and formative component of male patients' lives and actively view its characteristics as comprising more than just potential challenges to medical treatment--but also as untapped sources of resilience and strength.",Men at risk: considering masculinity during hospital-based social work intervention.,2012,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Unemployment and insecurity at work are a source of stress and may create a threat to individual physical and psychological health. The purpose of this study was to examine the connection between personal, functional, and professional variables and reports of how the health of hospital patients is impacted by financial status in Israel. One hundred and forty three hospitalized patients completed demographic, health-functional, and financial status questionnaires. Of the respondents, 32.9% reported a correlation between financial status and health. Significant connections were found between family status, lack of work, a change in partner's employment status, job insecurity, and financial commitments and reports of a correlation between financial status and health. The multivariate model predicting reports of a correlation between financial status and health was statistically significant.

The study's empirical base was a survey of fixed and open-ended questions; this article presents results from a subset of respondents (Care Aides and Assistant Nurses) working in facilities in three Canadian provinces (n=557) and across Sweden (n=292). The workers' experiences were linked to the broader economic and organisational contexts of residential care in the two jurisdictions. We found a high degree of country-specific differentiation of work organisation: Canada follows a model of highly differentiated task-oriented work, whereas Sweden represents an integrated relational care work model. Reflecting differences in the vertical division of labour, the Canadian Care Aides had more demanding working conditions than their Swedish colleagues. The consequences of these models for care workers, for elderly people and for their families are discussed.","Unheard voices, unmapped terrain: care work in long-term residential care for older people in Canada and Sweden.",2012,Canada,Int J Soc Welf"Social work clinicians across health care settings are uniquely positioned to disseminate valuable practice experience, thereby contributing to knowledge development within their field of practice and across disciplines.

Minority women were more likely to start smoking at a later age. Also, White women were more likely to smoke as the rate of poverty increased, while for minority women, smoking was unrelated to whether they lived in higher or lower poverty areas.

It also analyzes other determinants of help-seeking. It relies on data from the Black Rural and Urban Caregivers Mental Health and Functioning Study and is guided by a modified version of the behavioral model of health services use. Using hierarchical binary logistic regression, analyses reveal that only age, stress, and support from fellow church members are statistically significantly associated with the likelihood of help-seeking.

Cue reactivity has the potential to offer insights into treatment decisions; however, the use of cue reactivity in treatment studies has been limited. This study assessed the feasibility of using a virtual reality-based cue reactivity assessment approach (VR-NCRAS) during treatment. In a clinical smoking cessation treatment study, 46 treatment-seeking nicotine-dependent adult smokers were assessed for cue reactivity at baseline, Week 4, and Week 10 of treatment. Measures of cue reactivity included subjective craving and attention to cues after exposure to two neutral and two smoking cue environments.

A sample of 925 individuals hospitalized for severe mental illness were followed for a year after hospital discharge to examine the presence of disparities in mental health outcomes between African American and White individuals diagnosed with a severe psychiatric condition. Results from a series of individual growth curve models indicated that African American individuals with severe mental illness experienced significantly less improvement in global functioning, activation and anergia symptoms, and were less likely to return to work in the year following hospitalization.

Themes identified included life disruption, which encompassed the sub-themes of living scared, making sense of heart failure, and limiting activities. Resuming life was a contrasting theme involving culturally relevant coping strategies, and included the sub-themes of resiliency, spirituality, and self-care that helped patients regain and maintain a sense of self amid serious illness. Participants faced numerous challenges and invoked a variety of strategies to cope with their illness, and their stories of struggles, hardship, and resilience can serve as a model for others struggling with advanced illness.","Life disruption, life continuation: contrasting themes in the lives of African-American elders with advanced heart failure.",2012,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Social workers in Emergency Departments (ED) provide counseling, community resource linkage, and discharge planning.

The Measure of Process of Care (MPOC) was administered to a representative sample of 92 parents of CSHCN; a convenience sample of 43 health care professionals completed the service provider version of the MPOC. A mixed-model analysis of variance was conducted to test for group differences on matched domain scores of the MPOC. No significant differences emerged between the two stakeholder groups, but significant differences were detected among the four domain scores.

The purpose of this study was to identify and clarify the unique psychosocial challenges for those living with lupus. The specific analysis will help to develop a model to determine how different factors influence SLE patients' psychosocial needs. Key findings indicate that the highest general causes of depressive and anxious feelings were changes in appearance due to SLE and limitations in physical abilities due to SLE. The more chronic the symptoms, the more likely it was that feelings of depression would ensue. The more education subjects had, the less likely they were to report feeling depressed or anxious about their SLE challenges. Those with no health care insurance reported the highest levels of depressive and anxious feelings, those with Medicaid reported the second highest, and those with Medicare reported the least SLE-related depression and anxiety.

The 50 focus group participants identified personal/contextual and health system factors as major impediments to adherence to multiple medications. These factors included medication side effects, fear of harm from medication, fear of dependence on medication, complex instructions, suboptimal communications with doctor, suspicion about doctors' and pharmaceutical companies' motives in prescribing medication, and the high cost ofmedications. Participants also identified motivators, both internal (self-initiated) and external (initiated by family, doctor, support groups),to ensure adherence to multiple medications. These motivators included self-discipline, sense of personal responsibility, faith, support from family members and doctors, and focused health education and self-management support. Three themes emerged that enhanced understanding of the complexity of adherence to multiple medications: (1) reaching one's own threshold for medication adherence, (2) lack of shared information and decision making, and (3) taking less than the prescribed medication.

Children who are suspected of having been abused or neglected require an evaluation of their psychosocial situation. As an integral member of the health care team, the social worker is well placed to undertake comprehensive psychosocial assessments including information on the child's development, parental capacity, family, and community supports. Current practice approaches have seen a shift away from a narrow, &quot;expert&quot; approach to child protection. This article describes the development of an integrated model of social work service delivery to better respond to vulnerable and at-risk children in a pediatric hospital setting. Developing a new model of service required strategic planning, consultation, and endorsement from senior hospital management. The new model aimed to ensure a high quality, responsive social work service to children at risk of physical abuse, neglect, or cumulative harm. The change necessitated understanding of current research evidence, development of best practice guidelines, and effective communication with staff and external stakeholders. Policy development, implementation of practice guidelines, staff training, data collection, and service evaluation are described. The role of social work management and leadership were central in creating change. Visionary leadership is widely regarded as key to successful organizational change. The management approach included consultation with staff, building commitment to the need for change, addressing staff concerns, and providing a vision of enhanced client outcomes as a result of the change process.

This is a proposition derived from the dialectical perspective, which envisions the importance of promoting the quality of life of both the care recipient and provider. The proposition hinges on mediation by caring effectiveness. This mediation model is the focus of the present study. This study surveyed 232 dyads of Hong Kong Chinese older care recipients and their professional care providers in two waves. Psychological well-being and functional disability were the indicators of the quality of life of care recipients, whereas burnout was an indicator of the low quality of life of professional care providers. The results reinforce the mediation model by showing that caring effectiveness mediates the impact of the earlier burnout of the professional care provider on the subsequent psychological well-being of the care recipient. In turn, the earlier psychological well-being and functional disability of the care recipient also affect the burnout of the professional care provider.

The geographic distance between a mother's county of residence and the county in which she gave birth was examined in a rural state. Analyzing North Dakota county-level data using geographic information system (GIS) software, women from over half of the state's counties, making up nearly 18% of all births, were found to be over 40 miles to the hospital in which they gave birth. These findings suggest that rural women may experience significant geographic barriers as they receive health services in the prenatal, delivery, and postpartum periods of their pregnancy.

Data derived from a two-wave (2001, 2003) longitudinal survey of 1,324 parents aged 60 and over living in rural areas of Anhui Province, China. Structural Equation Modeling with latent difference score was used to estimate the reciprocal relatioships between children's support and elder parents' depressive symptoms. Results showed that older parents who had higher levels of depressive symptoms at baseline experienced reduced financial, instrumental, and emotional support from sons, but not from daughters. In rural China where the patrilineal family system has distinguished sons and daughters with respect to their functions in elder parents' support networks, the roles of sons and daughters warrant further examination, particularly when elder parents have some depressive symptoms, which elevates the needs of the parents and puts a strain on intergenerational relationships.",Parents' depressive symptoms and support from sons and daughters in Rural China.,2011,United States,Int J Soc Welf,Person-centered planning and participant decision making.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work,How can social work affect health care reform?,2011,United States,Health Soc Work,Implications of health care reform.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work,"Coordination, integration, and collaboration: a clear path for social work in health care reform.",2011,United States,Health Soc Work"The 1998 Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) was developed between states and tobacco manufacturers to settle the states' lawsuits against tobacco manufacturers and recover tobacco health-related costs.

Specifically, it examines the degree to which a state's tax code ranking along the progressive-regressive continuum relates to percentage of low birthweight babies, infant and child mortality rates, and percentage of uninsured children. Using data merged from a number of public data sets, the authors find that the level of state tax code progressivity is a factor in state rates of infant and child mortality. States with lower median incomes and regressive tax policies have the highest rates of infant and child mortality.With regard to the percentage of children 17 years of age and below who lack health insurance, it is found that larger states with regressive tax policies have the largest percentage of uninsured children. In general, more heavily populated states with more progressive tax codes have healthier children.

SMYs were defined by ever having a same-sex romantic attraction or having a recent same-sex romantic relationship or sexual partner. SMYs accounted for 7.5 percent of the sample. Data were analyzed to ascertain prevalence of risks and explore group differences. Compared with peers, SMY self-reports indicated higher prevalence rates on all indicators of health and mental health need. SMYs reported more sexual activity, more sexually transmitted disease diagnoses, a higher perceived risk for HIV/AIDS, and more forgone medical care than peers.Also compared with peers, SMYs reported higher levels of anxiety depression, suicidality, and physical and sexual victimization and higher rates of unmet mental health need. SMYs also reported greater concerns about confidentiality and were less likely to use school-based services.The majority of SMYs reported same-sex attraction only. Social work and other helping professionals should incorporate same-sex attraction questions into assessment protocols to target services for this population.

A series of binary logistic regressions were performed using data from 181 licensed, full-time social workers who reported aging as their primary specialty area as part of the 2004 NASW's national study of licensed social workers. Several variables were identified as being significant predictors of commitment to aging, including clients' source of insurance, practitioners' years of experience in social work and gerontology, perceived adequacy of training, number of social work colleagues in the work environment, perceived appropriateness of delegated tasks, and annual income. This study illuminates critical areas of need to promote professional commitment to aging practice.

However, less scholarly efforts have been devoted to understanding children's food preferences in extended family households. Drawn on data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) 2006 (n = 662), this exploratory study compares food preferences of adolescents living in extended families with those residing in nuclear families. T-test results show that adolescents living in extended families (n = 202) had unhealthier food preferences compared with those living in nuclear families (n = 460). They showed more liking for fast food, salted snack food, and sugared drinks, and less liking for vegetables and fruits.

This study uses data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey to estimate the extent to which paternal incarceration increases family material hardship. Analyses from a series of longitudinal regression models suggest that material hardship is statistically significant and positively associated with paternal incarceration. These hardships are found to reflect not only a reduction in fathers' income and financial contributions but also an increase in financial and other family strains. The findings underscore the challenges facing families with incarcerated fathers.

Findings suggest that adolescents in most other family types tend to have poorer outcomes than those in two-biological-parent families. Adolescents living with their biological father but not their mother have similar outcomes to those living with their single, biological mother. Although transitioning to a single-parent family is adversely associated with multiple outcomes, few associations are found for other types of transitions, and there are few differences in adolescent outcomes by parental marital status. Estimates from models utilizing adolescent- and caregiver-reported outcome measures, though similar with regard to behavior problems, differ considerably with regard to physical health and emotional well-being such that those using adolescent reports suggest a stronger relation between family structure and adolescent well-being than those using caregiver reports.","Family Structure and Adolescent Physical Health, Behavior, and Emotional Well-Being.",2011,United States,Soc Serv Rev"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA's) mission is to care for those who have borne the battle.

There are a significantly higher proportion of substance problems experienced by Aboriginal Australians than non-Indigenous Australians. Ways to address these problems are limited by racial barriers to mainstream services, especially in the rural context. Soft entry was an approach designed to increase Aboriginal Australians' access to Drug &amp; Alcohol (D&amp;A) services. The approach was designed to put control over when and how D&amp;A interventions were delivered in the hands of the community and individuals within it by giving them ready access to a human services worker with specialist knowledge. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods found that soft entry substantially increased the number of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women accessing drug and alcohol services. It fundamentally shifted the power relationship between counselors and community, providing opportunities to develop a non-stigmatizing trustful rapport to facilitate discussion of harmful substance use. The challenges for drug and alcohol counselors were the slow unpredictability of the approach and the need for highly skilled and responsive communication techniques.

The majority of women contacting the abortion clinic had already made up their minds to have an abortion and were therefore not seeking options counseling. Neither were they seeking to emotionally confide in their abortion counselors: They anticipated that the counselor would try to discourage them from having an abortion, they stated that they had met their emotional needs elsewhere, and they feared that confiding in the counselor might endanger their ability to obtain an abortion. They perceived other women needed counseling, though, to help them make a responsible decision.

Having co-occurring mental and substance disorders, experiencing an episode in the past 12 months, and having more people in the informal network increased the likelihood of using professional services and informal supports. Marital status, age, and socioeconomic status were also significantly related to help-seeking. The results suggests potential unmet need. However, the reliance on informal support also suggests a strong protective role that informal networks play in the lives of black men.",Use of Professional and Informal Support by Black Men with Mental Disorders.,2011,United States,Res Soc Work Pract"Research on families dealing with mental illness has considered either positive or negative aspects of intergenerational family relationships. The current study extends this work by using intergenerational ambivalence theory to examine aging mothers' contradictory expectations toward adult daughters who are mentally ill. This study focuses on interviews obtained from a sample of 22 mothers aged 52-90 who expressed considerable sociological ambivalence in relation to their grown daughters. Four strategies of managing ambivalence are identified: excusing behaviors, reducing expectations, adjusting help-giving, and confronting. The implications are that practitioners should be aware of intergenerational ambivalence, help aging parents identify their ambivalence management strategies, and assess the extent to which these strategies are adaptive. Future research directions in this area are also discussed.",Intergenerational Ambivalence: Aging Mothers Whose Adult Daughters are Mentally Ill.,2011,United States,Fam Soc"This study examines the demographic correlates of depressive symptoms, serious psychological distress (SPD), and major depressive disorder (MDD; 12-month and lifetime prevalence) among a national sample of African American men. Analysis of the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) data set provides first-time substantiation of important demographic differences in depressive symptoms (measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale [CES-D]), SPD (measured by the K6), and 12-month and lifetime MDD among African American men. Findings illuminate the heterogeneity within the African American male population. Findings also demonstrate the need for additional research focusing on within-group differences and a comprehensive research and mental health promotion agenda that recognizes the importance of improving access to education and employment and promoting healthy coping behaviors, while acknowledging the larger social context in which African American men live.",Correlates of Psychological Distress and Major Depressive Disorder Among African American Men.,2011,United States,Res Soc Work Pract,Advancing HIV/AIDS domestic agenda: social work and community health workers unite.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 25 percent of people living with HIV in the United States in 2006 were age 50 and older. HIV prevention for people over 50 is an important health concern, especially as the U.S. population grows older. Scholarly research has identified the need for HIV/AIDS interventions in the population of people over age 50, but few interventions have been established. The ecological perspective, which integrates intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community, and policy factors, was used to review the current interventions and propose possible new HIV/AIDS prevention efforts for older adults. Intrapersonal interventions are often based on the health belief model. The precaution adoption process model was explored as an alternative intrapersonal theory for modeling prevention efforts. Community interventions using diffusion of innovations theory are fully explored, and new interventions are proposed as an option for preventing HIV/AIDS in older adults. An agenda for future research and interventions is proposed. Social workers will be at the forefront of the effort to prevent HIV/AIDS in older adults. They must accept this responsibility, propose interventions, and evaluate their effectiveness.",HIV/AIDS interventions in an aging U.S. population.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work"Depression is the most common psychological challenge faced by many individuals and families following stroke. Fortunately, poststroke depression is treatable, and even preventable, if social work and other rehabilitation practitioners understand the most common risk factors and become familiar with measures for assessing for depression among patients with medical comorbidities such as stroke.The purpose of this article is to raise awareness among readers about the strong potential for depression following stroke and to provide an overview of common assessment measures. On the basis of increasing numbers of patients being cared for by informal caregivers following discharge from inpatient care facilities, growing evidence of the interconnectedness of couples' emotional well-being and the significance of couples-level factors like relationship quality and coping in the well-being of couples experiencing stroke, and current needs for effective interventions for poststroke depression, a secondary purpose of this article is to describe the importance of assessing and treating survivors in the context of their committed relationships.",Poststroke depression: social workers' role in addressing an underrecognized psychological problem for couples who have experienced stroke.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work"This article examines associations between cumulative adverse financial circumstances and patient health in a sample of 1,506 urban emergency department (ED) patients. Study participants completed a previously validated Social Health Survey between May and October 2009. Five categories of economic deprivation were studied: food insecurity, housing concerns, employment concerns, cost-related medication nonadherence, and cost barriers to accessing physician care. Logistic regression that adjusted for the effects of demographics (age, gender, race, education) tested the association between the cumulative number of adverse financial circumstances (range: 0 to 5) and patients' health status (self-rated health, stress level, depressed mood) and health behaviors (smoking and substance abuse). Approximately 48 percent of respondents reported one or more financial concern, and 31 percent reported two or more financial concerns. A significant graded relationship was found between the number of adverse financial circumstances and patients' poor/fair self-rated health, depressed mood, high stress, smoking, and illicit drug use. Findings suggest that in today's acute health safety net, patients' concerns related to financial insecurity are very relevant to patient health.This underscores the imperative for hospital-based social workers to design models of routine social health risk screening and system interventions that address patient financial well-being in the ED.",Cumulative adverse financial circumstances: associations with patient health status and behaviors.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work"Social factors that affect women's attitudes toward menopause were examined in a sample of 1,037 baby boomer women who took part in two waves of the Midlife in the United States survey. Survey data were collected in 1996 and 2005 from a nationally representative sample of women born between 1946 and 1964 residing in the United States. Women's attitudes toward the effects of menopause on fertility, health, and attractiveness were examined. Analyses supported a two-factor model ofwomen's adaptation to menopause: attitudes concerning the effects of menopause on fertility and the cessation of menstruation had different antecedents than attitudes concerning the impact of menopause on health and attractiveness. Women who had more positive attitudes regarding loss of fertility occupied more roles, were older, less educated, yet more secure financially. Women who had more positive views of the effects of menopause on health and attractiveness reported fewer symptoms of menopause. These analyses were replicated in waves 1 and 2 of the data set. Results may be helpful to social work practitioners and social work policy advocates.",Contextual influences on women's health concerns and attitudes toward menopause.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work"This study investigated the association between multimorbidity and persistent depression among cohorts of veterans with diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension. The retrospective longitudinal analysis used national administrative data on around 1.38 millionVeteran Health Administration clinic users merged with Medicare claims data. Multimorbidity was defined as the concurrent presence of two or more chronic conditions (for example, diabetes, heart disease, or hypertension). Chi-square tests and multinomial logistic regressions analyzed the odds in tested relationships. Of all veterans, 5.6 percent were diagnosed with persistent depression. Persistent depression was significantly more likely among veterans with multimorbidity than among those with only hypertension.Veterans with multiple chronic conditions have intensive, long-term health care needs due to persistent depression and, thus, require extensive coordination across a broad spectrum of services.","Multimorbidity and persistent depression among veterans with diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension.",2011,United States,Health Soc Work"One-third of U.S. adults do not have adequate health literacy to manage their health care needs; and low health literacy is a major concern due to its association with poor health outcomes, high health care costs, and health communication problems. Low health literacy is a potential driver of health disparities, and its alleviation is central to the values and concerns of the social work profession. Despite the extensive knowledge and skills that social workers can bring to bear to assist patients with low health literacy, the concept of health literacy is underused in social work scholarship.This gap reflects missed opportunities for social workers to contribute their expertise to the evolving field of health literacy and to strategically align their work with organizational and national priorities.To address this gap, this article provides an overview of health literacy, its relevance to social work, and its representation in disciplinary literature; and it outlines opportunities for health social workers to systematically incorporate health literacy concepts and tools into their practices with patients and families.

Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 73 years. Half were born in the continental United States, and half were born in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. All were sexually active within the past 90 days with a male partner.The authors compared sociodemographic characteristics, experience of intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV sexual risk factors (number of partners, history of sexually transmitted infections [STIs],condom use, and so on).Multiple regression analyses considering sociodemographic characteristics were a predictor for IPV and sexual risk behaviors. The authors found differences in sexual risk behaviors by place of birth (continental United States versus Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) and language chosen for the interview (Spanish or English).Puerto Rican women reported fewer sexual partners and STIs. Mainland-born and English-preference women reported more IPV, risky partners, and condom use. Birth in the continental United States and preference for English appear to be indicators of greater risk for IPV, risky sexual practices, and risky partners.

A case study design, and participant observations and a focus group methodology were used to explore the faith-based community residents' collaboration development, and design and implementation of the health promotion program. The implementation process can be described as occurring in four essential elements: (1) the development of the health ministry in each of the four churches; (2) the process in which the four ministries coordinated their activities to create the diabetes education program; (3) the process of delivering the diabetes education program; and (4) the challenges in promoting the diabetes education program across the community.

The Transtheoretical Model was used to examine the associations among child risk factors, parent's knowledge of factors associated with childhood obesity and their access to healthy foods in their community and parent's stage of change (SOC) in making behavior changes to improve their child's diet and level of physical activity. Parents (n = 124) of children between 6-12 years of age were surveyed. Perceived weight of the child and the child's body mass index (BMI) were found to be associated with parent's SOC for food portions and dietary fats, yet this was not observed for the fruits and vegetables or physical activity domains.

Native Hawaiian women are burdened by disproportionately high mortality from breast cancer, which is attributed to low participation in routine mammography. Mammography is proven to be an effective means for detecting disease at its earliest stages, when treatments are most likely to be successful. Culturally tailored screening programs may increase participation. Hawaiian initiatives call for screening innovations that integrate Hawaiian cultural strengths, including those related to spirituality and the extended family system. Before full-scale testing of tailored interventions, it is important to conduct feasibility studies that gauge community receptiveness to the proposed intervention and research methods. Study results establish the attractiveness and potential effectiveness of the authors' screening intervention. Recruitment exceeded targets, and retention rates were comparable to those of other randomized behavioral trials, confirming the value of reaching rural Hawaiian women through churches. Women appreciated the integrative approach of Hawaiian and faith-based values, and positive outcomes are suggested.This article may be relevant to social workers interested in culturally responsive, community-based interventions and to researchers conducting pilot studies and controlled trials of interventions adapted from evidence-based programs.",Testing the feasibility of a culturally tailored breast cancer screening intervention with Native Hawaiian women in rural churches.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work"Social workers are major mental health providers and, thus, can be key players in guiding consumers and their families to accurate information regarding schizophrenia.

Data were collected through structured baseline interviews with 320 adolescents (ages 15 to 18 years) who resided in foster care placements and participated in a larger evaluation study of an HIV prevention program. Final logistic regression models indicated that delinquent behavior and marijuana use were the most significant predictors of engaging in any one HIV risk behavior. Adolescents who reported delinquent behaviors, alcohol use, and marijuana use and who were female were more likely than their counterparts to engage in vaginal sex without using a condom. Future research is needed to further identify risk and protective factors for substance use, mental health problems, and HIV sexual risk behaviors among adolescents in foster care.

In the last two years, national initiatives have developed to address smoking within this population, yet there has not been an attempt to understand the perspectives of people with mental illness themselves regarding the role tobacco plays in their lives. This grounded theory study, based on focus group interviews with 26 individuals with various smoking statuses receiving outpatient mental health services, attempted to develop a theory to understand this high prevalence from the perspectives of people with mental illness. The article explores the experiences ofpeople with mental illness related to never smoking, smoking, and quitting; the role of tobacco use for people with mental illness; the other forces that promote or discourage tobacco use; and the tensions and complexities in understanding the &quot;problem&quot; of tobacco use in this population.

From a risk-and-resiliency perspective, hopelessness was approached as a culturally specific response to family stress and other challenges encountered by Mexican immigrants. Although Mexican-heritage women and other Latinas have higher prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders than their male counterparts, they experience disparity in accessing mental health services. Multiple regression analysis was used to explore the relationships among hopelessness, depression, social support, and other variables. Culturally rooted resiliency and a sense of optimism connected to immigration appear to shelter Mexican-heritage mothers from hopelessness and depression. A very large households and nonworking status were found to elevate the risk of hopelessness. Because poverty and acculturation levels were not related to hopelessness or depression, further culturally specific research distinguishing hopelessness from depression is recommended. Given that hopelessness sometimes presents itself independently from depression, implications for practice include the need to refine mental health assessment tools to capitalize on the resiliency among immigrant mothers and avoid misdiagnosis.","Hopelessness, family stress, and depression among Mexican-heritage mothers in the southwest.",2011,United States,Health Soc Work,Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act: prospects and limitations.,2011,United States,Health Soc Work"The study examines over-indebted fathers after separation/divorce with respect to health-related lifestyles/state of health.

Comprehensive data on cognition and employment were collected annually.RESULTS: Individuals treated with CET were significantly more likely to be competitively employed, had greater earnings from employment, and were more satisfied with their employment status by the end of treatment compared to EST recipients. Mediator analyses revealed that improvements in both social and non-social cognition mediated the CET effects on employment.CONCLUSION: CET can help facilitate employment in early schizophrenia, by addressing the cognitive impairments that limit functioning in the disorder. Inclusion of cognitive rehabilitation in social work practice can support more optimal functional recovery from schizophrenia.",Effects of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy on Employment Outcomes in Early Schizophrenia: Results From a Two-Year Randomized Trial.,2011,United States,Res Soc Work Pract"OBJECTIVE: To preliminarily evaluate telephone-delivered motivational enhancement therapy (MET) in motivating unadjudicated and nontreatment seeking intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators, who also use substances, to self-refer into treatment.

Furthermore, there is increased need for professionals with experience and interest in working with these brave individuals. Veterans and service members face significant challenges both during their service and after transitioning back to civilian settings. One such challenge for some veterans is substance use and its multidimensional effects on mental and physical health. The current article presents a brief but comprehensive overview of the prevalence and comorbidity of substance use disorders in veterans and service members. It also reviews practical information about assessment, treatment, and general clinical issues from the authors' clinical experience that is relevant to providers working with veterans and service members with substance use disorders. This information may be of particular interest to professionals with an interest in helping veterans, those who have limited experience working with veterans, or those who may work outside of standard military or Department of Veterans Affairs settings.

Analyses are based on a probability sample of African Americans living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The analytic sample includes 48 parents of a child with a disability and 144 comparison group parents of non-disabled children. Results showed that having a child with a disability is associated with more somatic symptoms.

One reason is that the interventions have not been culturally tailored to the disparity populations whose problems they are meant to address. Community-engaged research has been successful in improving the outcomes of racial and ethnic minority groups and thus has great potential for decreasing between-group health disparities. In this article, the authors argue that a type of community-engaged research, community-based participatory research (CBPR), is particularly useful for social workers doing health disparities research because of its flexibility and degree of community engagement. After providing an overview of community research, the authors define the parameters of CBPR, using their own work in African American and white disparities in breast cancer mortality as an example of its application. Next, they outline the inherent challenges of CBPR to academic and community partnerships.

There is specific concern about children because they represent the future. Ignoring children's health needs can compromise their educational preparedness, occupational pursuits, productivity, and longevity. Current science demonstrates that developmental, emotional, or behavioral limitations experienced during the early years of life and over the life course are associated with poor adult health outcomes. Poverty, restricted access to health insurance and health care services, cultural and linguistic barriers, neighborhood conditions, and racial and class inequalities exacerbate poor health outcomes and contribute to child health inequality. To respond to the complexities and threats of child health inequality, social workers must be sensitized to the physical and material constraints that support them and join forces with other disciplines in comprehensive approaches to reduce and prevent them.

The authors analyzed all working-age adult immigrants between the ages of 18 and 64 using the New Immigrant Survey data collected in 2003.This survey is a cross-sectional interview of recent legal permanent residents on their social, economic, and health status. Respondents were interviewed in English or in their preferred languages. Nearly two-thirds of immigrants were uninsured, in spite of their strong labor force participation. Of the four key classes of immigration--employment based, family sponsored, refugee/asylum program, and diversity program--the diversity program immigrants were least likely to be insured, controlling for a wide array of demographic, human capital, acculturation, and assets-related variables.

To address this gap, using longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study, the current study examined risk factors of CHC trajectory including race, BMI, and SES. The sample consists of 22,560 in 1998, 20,825 in 2000, and 19,004 in 2002. Data analysis was done through latent growth curve modeling. As expected, older adults presented an increasing trajectory of CHCs over time. Black Americans presented a significantly more negative CHC trajectory than did their white counterparts, confirming racial disparity in health over time. Consequent hierarchical analyses revealed that racial disparity in CHC trajectory can be explained by racial disparity in BMI and that racial disparity in BMI can be attributed to racial disparity in SES. Because low SES is closely related to unhealthy diet and negative health behaviors that may subsequently lead to obesity and chronic health conditions, the findings suggest that to address racial disparity in CHCs, it is important for social workers to continuously try to mitigate racial inequality in SES.",Can racial disparity in health between black and white Americans be attributed to racial disparities in body weight and socioeconomic status?,2010,United States,Health Soc Work"Social work practice in health is shaped by underlying paradigms.To effectively target health inequities, practitioners need to consider appropriate paradigms.

Finding HIV risk reduction strategies that are contextually relevant for this population is an important public policy priority. This qualitative study researched women who have experienced intimate partner abuse in order to develop a HIV/AIDS risk reduction intervention unique to their circumstances. This pilot study explored the critical components of such an intervention among a racially/ethnically stratified (African-American, Mexican-American and Anglo) sample of women (n=43) who have experienced IPA. Focus groups were conducted and transcribed, and a content analysis was used to identify major themes. In all five focus groups, participants viewed the research as interesting, good, beneficial, and/or important based on their perceptions of risk for infection. Respondents felt that they knew of ways to protect themselves from infection in non-abusive relationships; however, acknowledged the difficulties of doing so given the context of their abusive relationships. Examining the racial/ethnic differences across focus groups showed that the language used by women is quite variable. The ways in which survivors define rape, sexual abuse, and their own experiences are all unique; however, their actual experiences have many similarities. Discussed at length are the topics participants shared as critical in informing the design of an intervention and the relevance of the findings to social work clinical practice is explained.",HIV/AIDS Risk Reduction Intervention for Women who have Experienced Intimate Partner Violence.,2010,United States,Clin Soc Work J"The purpose of this study was to determine the trajectories of depressive symptoms as older youths from the foster care system mature while also examining the correlates of these trajectories. Data came from a longitudinal study of 404 youths from the foster care system in Missouri, who were interviewed nine times between their 17th and 19th birthdays. Depression was assessed with the Depression Outcomes Module and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV. Data best fit a model of three trajectory classes, describing young people (1) maintaining low levels of depressive symptoms (never depressed class, 78%), (2) with increasing symptoms (increasing class, 6%), and (3) with decreasing symptoms (decreasing class, 15%). The increasing depression group was mostly male youths who were working or in school; the decreasing class was mostly highly maltreated female youths exiting the foster care system from residential care, with low levels of employment, and in school.

It is indeed a major event of our time. The pandemic has killed so many people around the world and Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit. The nature of the pandemic lent it to stigma and discrimination, which have made caring for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) a big problem. It has also brought so much suffering on PLWHA around the world. This article examines the role of culture and the family in the care for PLWHA in Anambra State. Quantitative and Qualitative data collection methods (questionnaire and in-depth interviews) are used to elicit information from respondents. A total of 1000 copies of a questionnaire were administered on adult males and females and 914 were completed and analyzed. Furthermore, in-depth interviews were conducted on 10 opinion leaders using an interview guide. Data were analyzed in themes based on the objectives and the data from in-depth interviews were used to support data from the questionnaire. The results showed that certain cultural practices such as cultural obligations to sick, blood relations, collective ownership of children, affinity to blood relations, and strong marital bond enhance care and support for PLWHA. Also, the burden of care for PLWHA was found to be on the family in the study area. In conclusion, cultural practices and the family play major roles in the care for PLWHA in the area and should be harnessed in order to make life more comfortable for PLWHA.","The role of cultural practices and the family in the care for people living with HIV/AIDS among the Igbo of Anambra State, Nigeria.",2010,England,Soc Work Health Care"This qualitative study comparing poverty perceptions of social workers (SWs) and primary care physicians (PCPs) employed in Israel's public services found that both attributed the poverty of their own clients to similar causes--individualistic, structural, fate, and policy--but differed in most of their perspectives and moral imperatives. The PCPs tended to be more angry, skeptical, and accusatory than the SWs, who were more forbearing and accepting. Both believed that those in a position to work should, but only PCPs held that they should work for any salary. With respect to policy, PCPs looked at the macro, SWs at the micro.

This article presents an analysis and develops a model of the factors that influence unlearning which is focused on the health care industry and is comprised of three constituent components: (1) a framework characterizing the lens through which individuals view situations; (2) a framework for characterizing how individual habits change; and (3) a framework for characterizing the manner in which emergent understandings are consolidated into existing knowledge and knowledge structures. The model was developed and analyzed using qualitative data from the Hospital-in-the-Home Unit of a Spanish Regional Hospital. From a practical perspective the article provides for the identification of factors that influence the nature and effectiveness of the unlearning context in Hospital-in-the-Home-Units in regional hospitals. This not only valuably adds to the knowledge of the way these units function but also may enable actions to be taken to improve the learning processes associated with such units, resulting in an improvement in the quality of knowledge used in day-to-day decision making.

The robustness of this theory derives from the many disciplines and fields of study in which diffusion has been studied, from the international richness of these studies, and from the variety of new ideas, practices, programs, and technologies that have been the objects of diffusion research. Early theorizing from the beginning of the 20th century was gradually displaced by post hoc empirical research that described and explained diffusion processes. By the 1950s, diffusion researchers had begun to apply the collective knowledge learned about naturalistic diffusion in tests of process interventions to affect the spread of innovations. Now, this purposive objective has given form to a science of dissemination in which evidence-based practices are designed a priori not just to result in internal validity but to increase the likelihood that external validity and diffusion both are more likely to result. Here, I review diffusion theory and focus on seven concepts-intervention attributes, intervention clusters, demonstration projects, societal sectors, reinforcing contextual conditions, opinion leadership, and intervention adaptation-with potential for accelerating the spread of evidence-based practices, programs, and policies in the field of social work.",Applying Diffusion of Innovation Theory to Intervention Development.,2010,United States,Res Soc Work Pract"While the incidence of psychological distress among people receiving treatment for cancer in outpatient treatment settings has received attention by researchers, few studies have investigated the incidence of psychological distress in inpatient settings. Similarly, efficacy or effectiveness studies describing psychosocial interventions with cancer patients in inpatient settings are all but absent from the research literature. The purpose of this study was to screen for psychological distress among persons receiving inpatient treatment for cancer and to then test the efficacy of a communications model known as FLEX CareÂ®, used to enhance routine psychosocial care, in an effort to reduce measurable levels of psychological distress. Following the vetting of more than 400 potential participants, 35 met rigorous screening criteria and also consented to participate in this randomized pre-post control group study. The intervention group received the FLEX CareÂ®-enhanced routine psychosocial intervention, while the control group received the routine psychosocial intervention alone. Mean scores for psychological distress were found to be nearly twice as high in the study sample as those levels reported in outpatient studies. Additionally, participants who received the FLEX CareÂ®-enhanced psychosocial intervention experienced a significant reduction in psychological distress in contrast to participants in the control setting. The findings from this study underscore the need to screen for symptoms of psychological distress in inpatient settings and lend preliminary support to the use of personalized psychosocial intervention strategies that can be used as adjuvant to routine psychosocial care in the inpatient setting to reduce psychological distress.",Decreasing psychological distress in cancer inpatients using FLEX CareÂ®: a pilot study.,2010,England,Soc Work Health Care"Since its inception in the 1900s, hospital social work has been impacted by the ever changing hospital environment.

Of the six areas, the lowest percentage of directors reported having training in homophobia. Three-fourths of the sample had not received even one hour of homophobia training over the past five years. Directors who were more recently educated were more likely to report having received homophobia training, as were directors with a college degree, and those who worked in nursing homes located in the West and South regions of the United States. Directors with the most experience were less likely to report having received training.

Participants were 104 Israeli female clients from four methadone clinics (Mean age = 39.09, SD = 8.61) who reported victimization to childhood sexual abuse. We tested traces in urine of these female clients for heroin a year preceding and a year following the assessment of their PTSD. Results show that 54.2% reported symptoms that accedes the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. We found that among childhood victimized women PTSD is associated with more frequent use of heroin at a 1-year follow-up even after controlling for duration of the stay at the clinic, background, other traumatic experiences and heroin use a year prior the assessment of their PTSD. This study shows the potential long-run negative consequences of childhood sexual abuse. Not only are these sexually abused women trapped into drug dependence and addiction, they cannot break the vicious cycle of continuing the use of illicit drugs even when treated for their addiction.

This study utilizes National Household Education Survey data for a 14-year period to examine the effects of public funding on the enrollment of low-income children in early childhood education and care. It also considers the effects of funding on the type of care they use. Results suggest that public funding, particularly child-care subsidies and prekindergarten funding, increases the likelihood that low-income children, even those under 3 years of age, will attend nonparental care, including center-based care.

Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, this article considers how contributions change over time and the effects of child support enforcement on these contributions. Findings suggest that total cash support received drops precipitously over the first 15 months of living apart (as informal support drops off) and then increases slightly after 45 months (as the increase in formal support overtakes the decrease in informal support). While the study finds no effect of enforcement on total support received in the first 5 years after a nonmarital birth, the substantial differences in total cash support received by the length of time that parents have not been cohabiting suggest that strong enforcement may be efficacious over time.",Child support enforcement and fathers' contributions to their nonmarital children.,2010,United States,Soc Serv Rev,A call to action for social work: minimizing financial hardship for families of children with special health care needs.,2010,United States,Health Soc Work,Unnatural causes: is inequality making us sick?,2010,United States,Health Soc Work,Supporting indirectly traumatized populations: the need to assess secondary traumatic stress for helping professionals in DSM-V.,2010,United States,Health Soc Work"The suddenly bereaved are faced with not only a very difficult grief experience, but also a lack of access to supportive services to assist them in working through that grief. The social work-medical examiner model was developed in an effort to address the challenge of reaching this population. The model provides a connection between social work practice and families experiencing sudden death. The model is rooted in services embedded within social work practice--crisis intervention, grief support, and referral assessment. In addition, the model demonstrates a mutually beneficial relationship between the social worker and the ME--each benefiting from the intricacies of the model process. Social work has had a prominent voice in the advancement of end-of-life care as it relates to families grieving long-term illness. The intervention described in this model expands this care, showing how social work practice can reach the suddenly bereaved population.

These services are provided by social workers, other mental health professionals, and paraprofessionals from the local community. The present study examined whether CCP grant recipients that reported more tailoring of their interventions to the needs of diverse community segments achieved greater community penetration. The study reviewed archival records from 36 crisis counseling projects ending between 1996 and 2001. Numbers of clients and client ethnicity were determined through service logs. Tailoring ofservices was determined by content coding of projects' reports. Community demographics were determined from census data. Fifty-six percent of the projects reported using three or more tailoring strategies, suggesting a &quot;precompetence&quot; or greater stage of cultural competence. The proportion of members of racial or ethnic minority groups among program clients closely matched the proportion in grantees' communities. Projects that reported more types of tailored activities reached more clients and served more members ofminority groups. These findings confirm that adapting crisis counseling services to diverse local needs is associated with greater community penetration of mental health services.",Tailoring disaster mental health services to diverse needs: an analysis of 36 crisis counseling projects.,2010,United States,Health Soc Work"War poses a challenge for social workers, adding exposure to direct risk of personal harm to the general stress of social work practice. Artworks are frequently used in health care settings with people in high distress. This study had three goals: (1) to characterize the stressors of social workers living in a war zone, (2) to teach social workers in crisis situations to identify stress and resilience factors in their artworks, and (3) to develop a general self-care model for arts intervention for professionals in these situations. Common stressors experienced by participants were anxiety and fear as a result of bombs, sirens, worry over loved ones, and overexposure to media. These were layered onto professional stressors, including constant work communication on cell phones during war and dilemmas related to work-family conflicts. Allowing social workers to name and identity the sources of their stress and then change their artwork to enhance resilience helped them to gain a sense of control over diffuse sources of anxiety. The authors propose this method as an effective intervention model with social workers in high-stress situations.",Using art as a self-regulating tool in a war situation: a model for social workers.,2010,United States,Health Soc Work"To date, there is little evidence to inform social work practice with lesbian and bisexual women who are trying to conceive (TTC). The authors report a preliminary examination of the mental health experiences of lesbian and bisexual women who are TTC, through a comparison with lesbian and bisexual women in the postpartum period (PP). Thirty-three lesbian and bisexual women (TTC, n = 15; PP, n = 18) completed standardized questionnaires assessing symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as relationship satisfaction and perceived social support. Qualitative interviews were also conducted to further investigate the experience of TTC. No significant differences were found between groups on any of the dependent variables. Analysis of qualitative data highlighted the challenges for lesbian and bisexual women who are TTC, particularly in terms of difficulty conceiving, lack of support during the conception process, and heterosexism in the fertility system. Women perceived these challenges to conception as having emotional consequences. The findings from this study begin to elucidate the unique context of TTC for lesbian and bisexual women, and they highlight the importance of culturally competent social work practice with this population.",Challenges and mental health experiences of lesbian and bisexual women who are trying to conceive.,2010,Canada,Health Soc Work"This article investigates general physician service use by a national sample of non-Hispanic white and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries age 65 and older. Using the health behavior model as the conceptual framework, Oaxaca decomposition multivariate analyses were conducted to examine predictors for contact with a physician and the number of physician's office visits. Racial and ethnic differences were found in the predictor variables of initial contact with the physician and volume of physician service use. Besides needs factors, poverty level and having Medicaid were also significant predictors. Oaxaca decomposition analysis indicated that Hispanic beneficiaries' being less likely to make the initial physician contact could not be explained only by racial and ethnic differences. Although findings point to the equitable and nondiscriminatory treatment of Hispanic beneficiaries already using physician services, there is variance in the entry point of contact with a general physician for this minority group.

While nursing home placement (NHP) can alleviate certain caregiving responsibilities, new stressors can also emerge. In the present study, the researchers examined how care-related factors can change leading up to NHP and how these factors influence caregiver outcomes following NHP. A sample of 634 family dementia caregivers (n = 634) were surveyed at three six-month intervals prior to NHP and once during the 12 month period following institutionalization. Growth curve modeling revealed dynamic changes in certain factors leading up to NHP (e.g., caregivers' perceived health), while other factors remained stable (e.g., caregiver burden). Several factors emerged as significant predictors of caregiver burden following NHP, including pre-placement burden and adult day service utilization.

Data come from a randomized trial of the keepin' it REAL program, using a predominantly Mexican American sample of middle school students in Phoenix, Arizona. Schools were randomly assigned to a control group or to one of three culturally tailored intervention versions. We hypothesized that school ethnic and linguistic acculturation composition (percent Latino, percent non-English speaking at home) and individual level of linguistic acculturation jointly would moderate the efficacy of the prevention program, as indicated by students' alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use. Using multilevel linear modeling and multiple imputation techniques to manage clustered data and attrition, results showed that desired program effects varied by the linguistic acculturation level of the school, the program version, and individual acculturation level. The Latino intervention version was more efficacious in schools with larger percentages of non-English speaking families, but only among less linguistically acculturated Latino students. There were no significant school level program effects connected to the percentage of Latino students at school, the other versions of the program, or among more linguistically acculturated students.",Influences of School Latino Composition and Linguistic Acculturation on a Prevention Program for Youth.,2010,United States,Soc Work Res"The authors report on a bibliometric study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) scholarship among scholars in schools of social work in the United States.

Eighteen facilitators responsible for delivering COPMI programs across Australia were interviewed, fifteen of whom include education about mental illness in their treatment programs. According to program facilitators, education about mental health was important because they believed that knowledge equates to power, and can be cathartic. Education chiefly consisted of signs, symptoms, and treatments of various mental illnesses. The dominant mode of delivery was small and large group discussion.

While self-determination is desirable, it can also lead to new challenges, as when patients who are critically ill and/or dying must rely on family members to function as primary caregivers and managers of their treatment plans. Typically, patients and their families lack the guidance and oversight of a medical professional to coordinate a multifaceted health care regimen instituted by the variety of specialists involved in patients' diagnoses and treatments. As the patients' health declines and treatment plans become more complex, so too does the level of involvement of family caregivers, who often must manage treatment plans in addition to providing bedside care. This article cites the example of a woman who was exhausted by her role as sole caregiver for her dying husband and describes her feelings of powerlessness within the hospital setting as she struggled to coordinate assistance from her husband's medical specialists during end-of-life decision making. This case illustrates the importance of the following: (a) in cases involving hospitalized patients who require complex care from multiple specialists, it should become standard practice to enlist medical social workers to provide an overall assessment of the patients' status, prognoses, and home care plans, (b) in cases involving prolonged home care culminating in end-of-life decisions, the needs of nonprofessional caregivers must be recognized, evaluated, and addressed.",Who cares for the caregivers?

The study used the third and fourth waves of the Illinois Families Study--Child Well-being Supplement--a four-year panel study examining the impact of welfare reform on the well-being of the youngest children of current and former welfare recipients. Logistic regression techniques were used. The analytic results show that low-income children whose caregivers exercise child health-promoting behaviors (for example, mealtime routines, dental hygiene practices, safety practices), with the exception of having a regular bedtime, are more likely to be reported as having excellent health than their low-income counterparts. Moreover, a statistically significant cumulative effect above and beyond the individual effects of health-promoting behaviors was found. The findings suggest that child health-promoting behaviors by caregivers can make a difference in promoting better health for low-income children. Although large systemic changes (for example, changes in health care policy) are needed to reduce overall health disparities and to enhance health for all members of society, individual health-promoting behaviors may lead to incremental improvements in low-income children's health.",The impact of health-promoting behaviors on low-income children's health: a risk and resilience perspective.,2010,United States,Health Soc Work"Mental health practitioners are increasingly called on to administer spiritual assessments with Native American clients, in spite of limited training on the topic.

Differences in depression were reported between groups, with grandparents with poor HRQOL also reporting clinically significant depression, grandparents with fair HRQOL reporting marginally clinically significant depression, and grandparents with good HRQOL reporting no depression. In a qualitative analysis, grandparent conceptualization of what they need to do to maintain and improve their health was explored for each group. Findings from the quantitative analysis indicate variation in grandparent health and mental health status and suggest that services should be tailored to address grandparent needs. The qualitative analysis highlights the importance of religion and spirituality to grandparents, the economic concerns of grandparents, and the need for transdisciplinary services.",The health-related quality of life of custodial grandparents.,2010,United States,Health Soc Work,Does health insurance matter?

It examines sense of community as a protective factor against adult psychological distress associated with experiences of physical or psychological violence in childhood from parents. Regression models are estimated using data from the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development in the U.S. and from the 1996-97 National Study of Daily Experiences. Reported experiences of frequent psychological violence, regardless of the frequency of physical violence, is found to be positively associated with adult psychological distress. Adults' sense of community is found to moderate the association between reports of both frequent psychological and frequent physical violence in childhood from parents and adult psychological distress.",Sense of Community as a Protective Factor against Long-Term Psychological Effects of Childhood Violence.,2010,United States,Soc Serv Rev"Through in-depth interviews, this study examined the relational context of sexual HIV risk for 10 Black women aged 18-30 who were defendants in a community court setting. A qualitative data analysis identified themes of actual and feared intimate partner violence (IPV) and the expectations of demonstrating trust in a relationship as obstacles to negotiating the use of condoms. The findings speak to the broader structural factors and consequences of IPV and drug use.

Under this model, 277 AIDS-orphaned youths (ages 11-17) from 15 comparable schools were randomly assigned to either the usual care, which involves provision of counseling and education-related supplies, or the experimental condition, in which participants also received matched-savings accounts. The analyses indicate that poor families in rural Uganda can and do save for their youths if provided with support and incentives. Analyses also locate statistically significant differences between youths in the experimental and control groups on attitudes toward saving, academic performance, educational aspirations, and health-related behaviors. The results suggest that savings-related interventions have a place in the care and support of orphaned youths in poor sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of such youths is steadily increasing.",Integrating Children's Savings Accounts in the Care and Support of Orphaned Adolescents in Rural Uganda.,2010,United States,Soc Serv Rev"Child welfare and criminology research have increasingly sought to better understand factors that increase the likelihood that abused and neglected children will become involved in the juvenile justice system. However, few studies have addressed this relationship among African American male adolescents. The current study examines the relationship between child maltreatment (i.e., neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and other/mixed abuse) and the likelihood of a delinquency petition using a sample of African American males (N = 2,335) born before 1990. Multivariable logistic regression models compared those with a delinquency-based juvenile justice petition to those without. Results indicate that African American males with a history of neglect, physical abuse, or other/mixed abuse were more likely to be involved in the juvenile justice system than those without any child maltreatment. Additionally, multiple maltreatment reports, a prior history of mental health treatment, victimization, and having a parent who did not complete high school also increased the likelihood of a delinquency petition.

The children range in age from 7 to 13. Findings reveal the important bonding function of food in family relationships. Two clinical themes were identified from the data: (1) food bonding nurturer and obese child; (2) eating and the bonding relationship with extended family. Putting a child on a diet was found to disrupt the bonding between the nurturers and the obese child. Power struggles over the loyalty of the child in food provision were also observed.

However, despite the multiple risk factors involved in such situations, interdisciplinary collaboration between experts in the psycho-social dimensions and experts in the bio-dimension of poor nutrition has not been a common model of practice. An evaluation was conducted in Israel of the experience of collaboration between social workers and dieticians in leading nutrition-education programs. A qualitative methodology was implemented with 22 participants. The findings illuminate the potential that interdisciplinary collaboration has to enhance the response of each of the professions to the risks for poor nutrition. The barriers affecting collaboration are: (a) role ambiguity about the non-administrative functions of social workers; (b) the dieticians' lack of sufficient familiarity with the life circumstances of low-income families and how to adjust the nutrition-related contents to their circumstances; and (c) difficulties to achieve a balance between the structured methods of knowledge delivery of the dieticians and the less structured methods of intervention of social workers. The findings illuminate the significance of incorporating suitable approaches into the collaboration for reducing these barriers.",Interdisciplinary collaboration between social workers and dieticians in nutrition education programs for children-at-risk.,2010,England,Soc Work Health Care"Individuals with hemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders are surviving beyond any life expectancy previously predicted and now face conditions associated with &quot;normal&quot; aging.

It utilizes a 3-year-long data set of social work self-reports on medical emergency room outcomes at a large, teaching hospital in the New York Metropolitan area with a sample size of 3370. The study findings suggest that social workers in this acute care hospital's emergency room often are referred the most complex cases. The data on this site indicate that the majority of social work dispositions were to home (54%) or a nursing facility (8.4%). Only 16% of the patients seen by social work were admitted to the hospital. These findings support the cost-effective nature of social work in the emergency room setting and the importance of finding alternatives to hospital admissions. The results of a logistic regression suggest that the criteria used by social workers to assess patients are based on sound psychosocial factors. Patients who were assessed as having &quot;Environmental&quot; (p = .00) or &quot;Relationship&quot; problems (p = .00) were much less likely to be admitted. Conversely, patients with &quot;Care/ADL&quot; problems (p = .00) and behavior problems (p = .00) had a heightened chance of being admitted.

Little research is available that investigates the role of peer support in post-burn recovery in terms of perceived benefits and costs. Findings revealed strong positive views regarding the helpfulness of peer support. Burn survivors reported that peer supporters provided a sense of belonging and affiliation and gave hope and confidence. Two-thirds of the sample had served as peer supporters themselves after receiving their injuries, suggesting that mutual aid does involve reaching out to others. At the same time, survivors spoke of possible costs in helping others.

Using data that is representative of urban non-marital births in the United States with a large over-sample of non-marital births, we investigate the association of maternal depression with not only marital status but also relationship quality with the father of the baby. Quality is independently associated with maternal depression after controlling for marital status and other variables that have been documented as risk factors for maternal depression. In addition, relationship quality explains away the associations between marital status and maternal depression.

With over one-half million women undergoing the surgical removal of their reproductive organs each year, clinical social workers need to be aware of the potential effects of hysterectomy on the physical, affective, social, spiritual, and sexual domains of women's lives. The sequelae of a hysterectomy portend consequences for the quality of a woman's life. Using qualitative and quantitative research methods, a Web-based questionnaire was used to examine women's lived experiences of hysterectomy in each of these domains. The findings of this exploratory study (n = 74) suggest that younger women may be at greater risk for depression than older women following hysterectomy and that physician gender may influence pre-surgery decision making.",The psychosocial dimensions of hysterectomy: private places and the inner spaces of women at midlife.,2010,England,Soc Work Health Care"This study focuses on the utilization of hospice services within the Latino community including both hospice and non-hospice users. Data were collected from 20 participants using semi-structured interviews. Verbatim transcripts were examined through a combination of ethnographic, open coding, and thematic categorization of the interviewees' responses. The research uncovers cultural factors that contribute to the underutilization of hospice services by this population. The findings indicate that hospice users learned about their terminal diagnosis during a hospital admission from an attending physician. When hospice services were offered, these individuals accepted the services. Conversely, all of the non-hospice users learned about their terminal diagnosis in a medical office setting from their primary physician.

A questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of urban children (eight to 16 years of age) asking about settings and situations in which they perceived discrimination. Two hundred and seventy-seven children completed the questionnaire; 88 percent ofthe children had at least one experience with racial discrimination, and 11.6 percent had experienced racism in at least half (12) of the 23 situations addressed in the questionnaire. Settings included schools and community contexts, and both peers and adults were perceived to be perpetrators. There were few differences in perceptions of racist episodes among different ethnocultural minority groups. Racism is perceived to be a common occurrence in many minority children's lives.

This freedom has facilitated community inclusion, access to alcohol and drugs, and the potential for developing substance abuse (SA) disorders. People with ID, who are known to have high rates of co-occurring serious mental illness (SMI), may be especially vulnerable to the consequences of this disease and less likely to use SA treatment. Using standardized performance measures for SA treatment access (initiation, engagement), rates were examined retrospectively for Medicaid beneficiaries with ID/SA/ SMI ages 12 to 99 (N = 5,099) and their counterparts with no ID/SA/SMI (N = 221,875). Guided by the sociobehavioral model of health care utilization, age-adjusted odds ratios and logistic regression models were conducted. People with ID/SA/SMI were less likely than their counterparts to access treatment. Factors associated with initiation included being nonwhite, living in a rural area, and not being dually eligible for Medicare; factors associated with engagement included all of the same and having a fee-for-service plan, a chronic SA-related disorder, or both. Social work policy and practice implications for improving the health of people with ID/SA/SMI through policy change, cross-system collaboration, and the use of integrated treatment approaches are discussed.",Disparities in access to substance abuse treatment among people with intellectual disabilities and serious mental illness.,2010,United States,Health Soc Work"This study examined the impact of physical and sexual trauma on a sample of 239 homeless men. Study participants completed a self-administered survey that collected data on demographics, exposure to psychological trauma, physical health and mental health problems, and substance use or misuse. Binomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine the relative significance of demographic factors and the four types of trauma exposure associated with three outcomes: mental health, substance abuse, and physical health problems. The authors found that trauma history was significantly associated with more mental health problems but was not associated with substance abuse problems for homeless men. This study reinforces service providers' perceptions that because many homeless men experience the long-term, deleterious effects of not only current stressors, but also abuse and victimization that often begin in childhood, homeless men are a subpopulation in need of proactive prevention services that emphasize long-term continuity of care rather than sporadic crisis-based services. Study findings suggest that mentally ill, homeless men need proactive services that address the sequelae of abuse with care that is specialized and distinctly different from care for homeless adults with substance abuse or physical health care issues.","Assessing trauma, substance abuse, and mental health in a sample of homeless men.",2010,United States,Health Soc Work"On the basis of current epidemiological and clinical research, this article describes how mental health symptoms are associated with heart disease, a major chronic condition that occurs primarily in middle and late life.

Using a posttest-only control group design, elders receiving home care services who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to one of three groups: ConversaciÃ_n A; ConversaciÃ_n B, with culturally relevant material added; and a control group. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to determine the effect on the two dependent variables: attitudes toward end-of-life planning and comfort with end-of-life planning. Significant differences were found among the three groups on both outcome measures. Attitudes toward advance planning scores were significantly higher for both intervention groups compared with the control group. Although both intervention groups had higher comfort scores than the control group, only the ConversaciÃ_n A score was statistically different from that of the control group.

The sample included children whose parents reported a need for mental health care or counseling in the previous 12 months, focusing on children with long-term emotional/behavioral problems rather than children experiencing episodic events that might only require short-term mental health services. Findings indicate that being uninsured increases the likelihood of parents reporting costs too much as the reason for their child having unmet mental health needs, whereas being insured by public health insurance decreases the likelihood of reporting costs too much as the reason. Policy implications include the need for expansion of health insurance coverage for all children and the need to achieve parity for mental health benefits in private health insurance.",What are the parent-reported reasons for unmet mental health needs in children?,2010,United States,Health Soc Work,Health care reform and older adults.,2010,United States,Health Soc Work,Use of a Web-Based Data System to Conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial of an Intervention for Children Placed in Out-of-Home Care.,2010,United States,Soc Work Res"An ex post facto analysis of a secondary dataset examined relationships between physical frailty, depression, and the self-perceived domains of health status and quality-of-life in older adults. The randomized sample included 992 community-dwelling, chronically ill, and functionally impaired adults age 65 and older who received care from a Southern California Kaiser Permanente medical center between 1998 and 2002. Physical frailty represents a level of physiologic vulnerability and functional loss that results in dependence on others for basic, daily living needs (Fried et al., 2001). The purpose of the study was to identify possible intervention junctures related to self-efficacy of older adults in order to help optimize their functionality. Multivariate correlation analyses showed statistically significant positive correlations between frailty level and depression (r = .18; p = &lt; .05), number of medical conditions (r = .09; p = &lt; .05), and self-rated quality-of-life (r = .24; p = &lt; .05). Frailty level showed a statistically significant negative correlation with self-perceived health status (r = -.25; p = &lt; .05). Notably, no statistically significant correlation was found between age and frailty level (r = -.03; p = &lt; .05). In linear regression, self-perceived health status had a partial variance with frailty level (part r = -.18). The significant correlations found support further research to identify interventions to help vulnerable, older adults challenge self-perceived capabilities so that they may achieve optimum functionality through increased physical activity earlier on, and increased self-efficacy to support successful adaptation to aging-related losses.",Factors associated with frailty in chronically ill older adults.,2010,England,Soc Work Health CarePerinatally infected HIV+ adolescents are confronted with unique psychosocial challenges as they navigate sexual behaviors and pregnancies.

The extent of the problem is difficult to assess in health settings due to underreporting and the fragility and reluctance of the elderly in being able to discuss the issue with health care providers. This appears to be related to the fact that perpetrators are frequently family members with resulting issues of aged dependency, family loyalty, and fear of the consequences of reporting. Of equal importance is a general lack of community understanding of aged abuse, including health professionals who frequently lack the confidence in screening and management to respond appropriately when aged abuse is suspected. Staff knowledge and skills emerge as a deficit in the detection of elder abuse and staff education has been identified as an effective means of improving the recognition of the abused elderly person in acute hospital settings. In addition, there remains a need for effective screening protocols. The aim of this study was to explore the recognition of aged abuse in an acute and subacute hospital setting.

Key questions were aimed at who gets HIV tested and why, what HIV education services were reported as most effective, and identifying the unique sociocultural obstacles to getting HIV tested. Some of the statistically significant findings include: (1) the most helpful HIV education was found to be support groups and the second most helpful was reading material offered in community based settings; (2) most residents choose to get tested under the direct advice of a physician; (3) Latinos tend to hold more HIV/AIDS Stigma than their African-American counterparts.

The high prevalence of mental and physical health problems of children in the child welfare system along with the inadequate utilization of health services make the role of caregivers essential for improving health outcomes. This article explores the barriers to meeting the health needs of this vulnerable population of children and how different types of caregivers (unrelated foster, kinship foster, and birth parents) utilize mental and pediatric health services.

Specifically, the authors tested the hypothesis that childhood physical and psychological abuse increase the risk of a child's running away from home by the time of adolescence. Running away from home is, in turn, hypothesized to increase the risk of delinquency and victimization. Childhood sexual abuse, modeled independently of physical and psychological abuse, is hypothesized to have a similar effect on the intervening factor of running away, as well as the two adolescent outcomes: delinquency and victimization. The sample of 416 adolescents was drawn from the Lehigh Longitudinal Study conducted in a two-county area of Pennsylvania. Findings show that physical and psychological abuse predict a child's running away from home. Running away predicts later delinquency and victimization and partially mediates the effect of earlier abuse. Both child abuse and running away from home are adverse events that can be addressed through systematic prevention and intervention efforts tailored to those who have been victimized. Findings can support social workers in their efforts to advocate on behalf of child abuse victims in developing interventions and support services.","Early Child Maltreatment, Runaway Youths, and Risk of Delinquency and Victimization in Adolescence: A Mediational Model.",2010,United States,Soc Work Res"HIV-related stigma has been identified as a barrier to HIV testing and prevention efforts internationally and nationally. Although the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is rapidly increasing in women aged 50 and older, little is known about the HIV-stigmatizing behaviors in this underserved population. In this exploratory analysis we investigated the influence of self esteem, sensation seeking, self silencing, and sexual assertiveness on the HIV-stigmatizing behaviors in 572 women aged 50 to 93. The variables considered in this analysis included subscales for the variables self silencing (Externalized Self Perception, Care as Self Sacrifice, Silencing the Self, Divided Self) and sexual assertiveness (Information Communication, Initiation, Refusal). Contributing predictive variables in the final model included: Self esteem (beta = -.190, t = -4.487, p = .000), Care as Self-Sacrifice (beta = .125, t = 2.714, p = .007), and Silencing the Self (beta = .164, t = 3.290, p = .001).

A cross-sectional survey collected sample characteristics and a 14-item menopause symptom checklist. Following the checklist respondents were questioned regarding perceived symptom causality. For classic menopause symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, and menstrual irregularities) a majority of women attributed menopause. For remaining symptoms, various attributions were reported or etiologies were unknown. How midlife women interpret their symptoms is important to understand since such appraisals may guide the type of health and treatment behaviors they choose. Education to promote understanding of the actual causes, diagnosis, and treatment of symptoms may encourage midlife women to seek appropriate intervention.

The purpose of the survey was to gather information on AOSW members' practice roles, the clients they serve, and their views on barriers cancer patients face in obtaining quality cancer care. The survey instrument was a self-administered 18-page survey disseminated online and by U.S. mail to members who did not provide e-mail addresses. The response rate to the survey was 62.3% (622/999). Reported barriers to quality cancer care are presented here in three categories: health system, social/environmental, and individual-level barriers. The majority of respondents reported health system barriers, specifically inadequate health insurance, as the major barrier to accessing quality health care for cancer patients. Among social/environmental barriers, inability to pay for treatment-related expenses was the major barrier. Among individual-level barriers, patients' fears and distress were the major barriers. The conclusions from this survey point to the critical role of oncology social workers in assisting cancer patients in overcoming the barriers to quality care and achieving optimum quality of life.",Barriers to accessing quality health care for cancer patients: a survey of members of the association of oncology social work.,2010,England,Soc Work Health Care"The association between perceived meaning of chronic illness and adherence to treatment was explored with a sample of 100 participants, 50 years old and older, diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and being treated with outpatient hemodialysis.

FRAMEWORK: We also relied on social control theories to guide our investigation of why adolescents may choose not to use drugs. PARTICIPANTS: The sample was N=1087 adolescents, the age ranged from 13 to 15 years, and the gender distribution was approximately equal. There were 71% Mexican Americans and 29% non-Latinos in the sample. METHODS: a number of measures were used including recent substance use, religiosity, religious affiliation, parental monitoring, parental permissiveness, parental norms, and acculturation. Linear regressions were used to examine the relationship between the variables of interest and the outcomes. RESULTS: Although the effect sizes of the significant relationships were modest, the findings are of interest because they reinforce the importance of the role of parents in the lives of their adolescents and supports previous studies that find that parents have great influence on children's behaviors including substance use. The results suggest that acculturating adolescents benefit from having clear rules from their parents concerning substance use, and from believing that there is some kind of consequence attached to their behavior. Parental monitoring, by itself, did not explain lower levels of drug use among these adolescents; but it was a predictor of adolescent strong anti-drug personal norms. This study is useful to social workers and other professionals working with parents and adolescents as it provides concrete evidence of possible parents pathway of influence on their children's health status.","Parental Monitoring, Religious Involvement and Drug Use Among Latino and Non-Latino Youth in the Southwestern United States.",2010,United States,Br J Soc Work"This prospective longitudinal study examines the antecedents of adolescent mothers' transition into adulthood and their attainment of multiple adult statuses in their early 30s in a nonclinical sample.

Analyses use the first three waves of longitudinal data from a subsample of single and noncohabiting mothers in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Results suggest that nonresident fathers' parenting is indirectly associated with children's behavior problems and cognitive development.

Low-dosage levels of treatment are found to have effects that are smaller than those estimated in ITT analyses or to have no statistically significant program effects. Moreover, individual mental health consultation services provided to high-risk children are found to have statistically significant effects on their school readiness.

Analyses, using an ordinary least squares regression model, find that families with a positive alcohol or drug screen in the year prior stay 85 days longer than those without a positive screen; families leaving shelter with a housing subsidy stay 66 days longer than those leaving without a subsidy. Demographic factors, education, employment, health, and mental health are not found to predict shelter stay duration. Consistent with prior research, housing resources relate to families' time in shelter; with the exception of a positive substance abuse screen, individual-level problems are not related to their time in shelter.

Welfare reform changed this citizenship construction dramatically, requiring mothers to work but failing to acknowledge their caretaking responsibilities. This article presents a discourse and content analysis of the welfare reform debate that directly referenced citizenship. Findings suggest that legislators emphasized paid work as a citizenship activity while rarely portraying parenting as such. Furthermore, legislators' endorsement of paid work as a duty of citizenship, and the manner in which they paired this endorsement with the minimizing of parenting as such a duty, may have further diminished the perception of parenting as a valuable citizenship activity.

Economic vulnerability, time constraints, and local norms are found to be linked to participation; program and logistical aspects, such as whether schools serve breakfast in the classroom and the length of time available for breakfast, are predictive.

Numerous advances have made the software more user-friendly, enabling users to conduct analyses without fully understanding the underlying assumptions or the implications from their analytic decisions. Unlike other fields, there have not been any published reviews in social work research that systematically describe and critique the use of SEM. This study systematically reviewed how SEM is used in social work research and the extent to which it reflects best practices. Thirty-two articles from top-ranked social work journals published from 2001 to 2007 were examined. Of the different types of SEM, the most commonly used was confirmatory factor analysis. Strengths of the research reviewed included examining models and measures not previously tested empirically and generating new insights into old topics through the use of SEM. Weaknesses included significant model modifications without theoretical justification or substantive interpretations. Suggestions are offered for improving applications of SEM in social work research.

Although research has demonstrated that for some individuals HIV is connected to preventable high-risk behaviors related to substance use, a further examination of how these risks are perceived by the individuals involved in these activities is warranted. This study presents the results of 11 focus groups with 89 African American women who use crack cocaine in which respondents shared their perceptions of HIV risk behaviors. The results of this study suggest that women crack cocaine users in Nashville,Tennessee, are not injecting the drug. There appeared to be high levels of perceived sexual risks associated with the use of crack cocaine by some users; however, this was not universal, as many active users have internalized HIV prevention messages. The results of this study are significant in that further understanding of the means by which individuals experience their risk behaviors will enable more effective targeting of potential interventions to reduce the spread of HIV.","Perceptions of sexual risks and injection for HIV among African American women who use crack cocaine in Nashville, Tennessee.",2009,United States,Health Soc Work"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, men who have sex with men account for the largest proportion of cumulative AIDS cases amongAsian Pacific Islanders.

As PN programs grow around the country, it is important to consult the key stakeholders in the development of these programs. The purpose of this qualitative study was to discuss the needs of medically underserved cancer patients and allow them the opportunity to provide input on models of care to meet their needs. Four focus groups were conducted in three major cities across Tennessee. Research participants (n = 36) were recruited by the staff in area cancer support programs and treatment programs across the state and through recruitment flyers at various treatment centers and community organizations. Findings revealed four key themes in the development of PN programs: (1) the PN needs to address access to quality care issues; (2) the PN needs to address the emotional and practical concerns of the cancer survivor, (3) the PN needs to address family concerns; (4) the PN needs to be involved across the continuum of care from time of diagnosis into long-term survivorship.

The qualitative component involved 38 HIV/AIDS stakeholders who were interviewed telephonically using a semi-structured interview schedule. The quantitative component comprised 607 People Living With HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) who were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The majority of PLWHA were female, never married, unemployed, aged between 26 to 45 years, Black African, and had more than grade 7 education. All stakeholders supported the disability grant (DG) because it improved the lifestyle of PLWHA. The CD4 count was cited as the main criterion for putting PLWHA on the DG. The conditions and characteristics of the DG were not clearly explained to PLWHA. The DG application process was viewed to be too long. Access to service points was perceived as a challenge for some PLWHA. The DG was used to meet basic household and health care needs. Not being on a DG was associated with lower CD4 counts, often without enough food, and less often without needed medicines in the past 12 months. Having the DG stopped was associated with often not having enough medicines that were needed in the past 12 months. We conclude that the DG is a lifeline for most HIV/AIDS-affected families. We recommend that DG should not use CD4 cell counts as criterion for DG eligibility; the conditions and characteristics of the DG should be fully explained to recipients; the DG application process should be completed within one day; PLWHA who no longer qualify for the DG yet do not have adequate financial means to meet basic necessities should be put on a nutritional support program; and access to the location of the grants by the poor and vulnerable should be improved.",Disability grant for people living with HIV/AIDS in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.,2009,United States,Soc Work Health Care"A good death is universally desired.

Stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that &quot;caregivers&quot; support and acceptance&quot; predicted fewer psychosocial symptoms of patients, whereas &quot;depressed family response to patient's illness&quot; and &quot;family anxiety&quot; predicted a greater number of psychosocial symptoms of patients upon their admission to palliative care. The findings suggested two possible pathways toward enhancing the psychosocial experience of dying patients, that is, the 'family support pathway&quot; and the &quot;familial-altruistic pathway.&quot; Further reflections on the findings may suggest that these patients may be situated in a &quot;support paradox, &quot;in which they desire family support but also worry about the burden that support places on family members.

This current study compared predictors of LOS for samples of patients referred to social services in three large urban hospitals in June-October 2002 (n = 176) and 2006 (n = 147), and examined changes in patient characteristics and the nature of social work practice. A significant relationship between psychosocial severity and LOS was again found, confirming the important role that social services can potentially play in controlling hospital costs. Some significant changes were also found in the pattern of social work practice; this was generally in the direction of more community consultation and collaboration, suggesting a greater emphasis on multidisciplinary teamwork.",Hospital length of stay: social work services as an important factor.,2009,United States,Soc Work Health Care,Promoting productive aging.,2009,United States,Health Soc Work,Posttraumatic stress disorder and government initiatives to relieve it.,2009,United States,Health Soc Work"Social workers in hospice and palliative care settings have been charged with the responsibility of addressing sexuality with their patients and families.

The study hypothesized that women's perceptions of the emotional and material social support they receive from family, friends, partners, drug treatment, child welfare, and welfare agencies will affect treatment completion. The sample consisted of 117 women who were enrolled in a women's residential treatment program. Data were collected in semistructured initial and follow-up interviews using a life history calendar; the Scale of Perceived Social Support, which was adapted for this study; and women's treatment records.

Forty-nine sets of parents of preterm babies and 50 sets of parents of full-term babies completed questionnaires about one month after the birth of their child. Parents of premature infants reported a higher level of stress-related growth than those of full-term infants, but no difference was found between them on parental self-efficacy In addition, gender differences in the dependent variables, as well as significant contributions of attachment style and self-esteem, were found. Professional guidance during pregnancy, aimed at expanding parents' knowledge and understanding of the changes they can expect to undergo, may serve to enhance the positive experience of growth in the transition to parenthood.",Parental self-efficacy and stress-related growth in the transition to parenthood: a comparison between parents of pre- and full-term babies.,2009,United States,Health Soc Work"The biopsychosocial perspective is a foundation of social work theory and practice.

These findings are complemented by the contributions of psychosocial genomics, a field of scientific inquiry that explores the modulating effects of experience on gene expression.

To mitigate such adverse effects and address the needs of 50 high-risk, low-income Latino and African American families receiving well-baby care at an urban primary care health center, a collaborative team from the social work, nursing, and education fields piloted a preventive two-year parent mentoring project. The intervention was theoretically anchored in the transactional model of child development. The mentoring practices used an activity-based approach for strengthening child anticipatory guidance and meeting family needs. Thirty-five intervention families completed the project.

Recently, research on child obesity has begun to examine the relationship between neighborhood environments and the health behaviors of youths. The current study used growth curve analysis based on multilevel modeling to examine the relationship between parents' perceptions of neighborhood safety and children's body mass index (BMI). Parents' perceptions of neighborhood safety had a significant association with children's BMI, and this relationship was fully mediated by television viewing. The results of this study suggest that when parents perceive their neighborhood to be unsafe, they will restrict their children's outdoor activities and increase the likelihood of sedentary indoor activity. Policies aimed at reducing overweight and obesity in children should take into account the neighborhood contexts in which children live.","Childhood body mass index in community context: neighborhood safety, television viewing, and growth trajectories of BMI.",2009,United States,Health Soc Work,The emerging needs of veterans: a call to action for the social work profession.,2009,United States,Health Soc Work"Despite the broad recognition in social work that services are more effective when they are tailored to individual client needs, we have only limited evidence of the impact that services matched to client needs have on treatment outcomes.

METHOD: 503 volunteers from residential or intensive outpatient treatment were randomly assigned to one of three conditions of Iowa Case Management (ICM) plus treatment as usual (TAU), or to a fourth condition of TAU only. All were assessed at intake and followed at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Clients in all four conditions significantly decreased substance use by 3 months after intake and maintained most gains over time. However, the addition of ICM to TAU did not improve substance use outcomes. CONCLUSION: Overall, the addition of case management did not significantly improve drug treatment as hypothesized by both researchers and clinicians.

The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of multiple dimensions of religiosity on depression among a lower income population of people with diabetes. Using a cross-sectional design, the study focused on a combined clinical and community sample of people with diabetes from low-income neighborhoods. On the basis of previous studies and confirmatory factor analyses of study data, five distinct dimensions of religiosity emerged: religious belief, reading religious materials, prayer, religious attendance, and engaging others in religious discourse. Bivariate correlation and hierarchical linear regression revealed robust and inverse associations between four of the five dimensions of religiosity and level of depression. Prayer, religious reading, religious attendance, and religious belief proved protective against depressive symptoms. Although it correlated with the other measures of religiosity, engaging in religious discourse was not distinctly associated with levels ofdepression. The analyses suggest that religious resources increase psychological resiliency among those managing the chronic stress of diabetes.

The purpose of this study was to examine factors that prevent survivors from seeking help from the legal, medical, and mental health systems and rape crisis centers. In this study, 29 female rape survivors who did not seek any postassault formal help were interviewed about why they did not reach out to these systems for assistance. Using qualitative methodology, this study found that survivors believed that formal social systems would or could not help or would psychologically harm them. Specifically, survivors thought that systems would not help because survivors themselves believed that they were unworthy of services or that their rape experience did not match stereotypical conceptions of rape. Survivors did not see how the systems could help or protect them from their assailants. Finally, survivors anticipated that systems personnel would cause them further psychological harm by not believing they had been raped or not caring about them. Survivors feared that system assistance would have intensified their painful feelings beyond their coping skills. Therefore, survivors who do not seek help may be attempting to protect themselves from perceived psychological harm.

The present study explored the frequency of HIV-infected African parents' disclosure of their status to their children and custody planning for their children's future to identify support needs among these families. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 47 parents (41 families). The study population included first-generation immigrants, with a total of 87 children less than 18 years of age. Only women had disclosed their HIV status, and only to eight of 59 children older than six. Half of the parents had talked to someone about future custody arrangements. These parents had more contact with a social worker at the social welfare office and with a medical social worker at the HIV clinic. Most parents (30) wanted their children to be cared for by a relative in Sweden or by their HIV-negative partner. Neither disclosure nor custody planning was associated with clinical status or antiretroviral treatment.

The goal of this prospective study was to investigate the psychosocial mechanisms involved in the preoperative use of private prayer for coping and the effects of such act on short-term quality of life (SPQOL) in 294 patients following open-heart surgery. Using established instruments, three interviews were conducted with middle-aged and older patients (average age 62) at two weeks and two days preoperatively, then 36 days postoperatively. The endpoints were assessed with levels of distress (e.g., depression and anxiety) and fatigue symptoms. Structural equation modeling was used to test a theoretical model. The final model showed the indirect influence of using prayer for coping on SPQOL through the mediation of cognitive coping and perceived social support.

However, closer analysis indicates that the primary focus of this research is concentrated on two-parent family systems. Despite evidence to suggest that single mothers are more likely to be parenting children with disabilities, their experiences have received minimal attention within social science research. Furthermore, when single mothers do become the focus of study, much of the attention is directed toward identifying the deficits within their family systems. Grounded in an integrated family resilience framework, the intent of this study was to explore the family adaptation of single mothers of children with disabilities within a longitudinal framework and to identify the individual, family, social, and environmental factors that contribute toward resilience within this population. Study participants consisted of 15 single mothers who had previously participated in the &quot;Family Strengths and Childhood Disability&quot; research project. Mothers were interviewed with the view toward identifying their perceptions of what constitutes risk and protective factors, and exploring these in the context of family adaptation and resilience. Findings revealed a marked contrast between public discourses about single motherhood and childhood disability and the personal narratives of the mothers in this study. Concepts of family resilience were revealed by mothers who challenged definitions of single mothers as inadequate, who disputed the definition of their children as &quot;disabled,&quot; and who moved from a position of received to authoritative knowledge. The study demonstrates that in contrast to public perceptions, single mothers of children with disabilities view their experiences as personally transformative and as a means of building confidence that empowers them to further disrupt negative expectations of their families.",Against all odds: resilience in single mothers of children with disabilities.,2009,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Terri Schiavo's life and death placed international focus on social workers' need to better understand and serve health care surrogates and proxies making life-sustaining treatment decisions on behalf of medical patients.

The study proposed a conceptual model of supervisory communication and tested it empirically using structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques with a random sample of 211 California state-registered social workers working in health or mental health care settings. The results of the present study provide empirical evidence of the unique roles that different types of supervisory communication play as antecedents of burnout and turnover intention. Specifically, supportive relationship communication had an indirect effect on burnout and turnover intention through its effect on perceived stress, whereas job-relevant communication had not only an indirect effect on burnout and turnover intention through its effect on stress, but also a direct effect on turnover intention. In addition, the results showed that upward communication moderated the relationship between stress and burnout.

Records were obtained from the Victorian Psychiatric Case Register for patients with career hospitalizations, 8,879 exposed to outpatient orders. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to determine the characteristics of patients solely selected for placement on orders directly from the community, in lieu of re-hospitalization, versus patients selected for placement on orders only from the hospital or for those who experienced both hospital and community-initiated orders. Ordinary least squares regression was used to evaluate the relationship of sole reliance on community-initiated orders and experienced changes in future hospital utilization. Outpatient orders were infrequently issued directly from the community by comparison with orders issued at termination of inpatient episodes. Patients whose placements on orders were carried out only through direct community placement differed from those whose placement was primarily initiated from hospital or from both hospital and community. The former group, while largely comprised of people with schizophrenia, was less likely to include such patients than the comparison samples. It also included fewer males and &quot;never married&quot; individuals as well as more individuals with major affective disorders. Those served solely with community-initiated orders showed significantly less use of subsequent inpatient care than individuals in the comparison samples, all other diagnostic and pre-morbid adjustment characteristics taken into account. For patients at risk of beginning a career of long-term psychiatric hospitalization, sole reliance on community-initiated orders appeared to prevent additional hospital involvement. The issuance of orders from hospital and the combined-order strategy were associated with protective oversight throughout extended inpatient careers.

The current study explores the differential effects of emotional and tangible support provided by family and friends and by formal services, and caregivers' perceptions of community services on spousal caregivers' burden. The study used a survey design with a sample of 85 spousal caregivers caring for their partners with dementia in the community. The study found that in-home services, as they are currently offered, do little to reduce the burden of spouses caring for their partners with dementia. Rather the most effective service is the provision of adult day programs, which provide not only respite for the spousal caregiver, but also opportunities for social interaction for their partners with dementia. This study further found that spousal caregivers experience a relatively high level of service-related stress.

Yet it seems to be an underappreciated and a deceptively complex intervention that social workers may not be adequately prepared to use. Reliable, accessible information is essential as it helps prevent unnecessary crises, facilitates coping, and promotes self-determination. This article conceptualizes education as a fundamental social work intervention and discusses the role social workers play in providing information that is both empowering and culturally sensitive. In particular, this article focuses on social workers working with patients and families facing life-threatening situations, including those in hospice and other end-of-life care settings. After reviewing the relevant literature and theory and exploring the inherent complexities of educational interventions, the authors recommend strategies for more effectively helping patients and families access the information they need.",Education: a complex and empowering social work intervention at the end of life.,2009,United States,Health Soc Work"This study addresses the factors influencing decisions to send medicine-surgical (med-surg) patients home or to nursing facilities (NFs). The sample (n = 7,852) was taken from a large, urban, teaching, med-surg unit where discharges were documented and data collected over a two-and-a-half-year period. Using logistical regression, the factors found to most influence the decision were age (z = 26.99, p = .000; odds = 1.06); patients diagnosed with &quot;musculoskeletal system&quot; problems (z = 11.07, p = .000; odds = 5.36); and needing skilled professional care (z = -15.03, p = .000; odds = .21) or nonprofessional personal care (z = 6.62,p = .000; odds = 2.32). Having less effect, but important information for discharge planners, was being an African American (z = 3.82, p = .000; odds = .76) or Latino (z = -3.96, p = .000; odds = .54).

In order to explore the coping experience of men and their families facing prostate cancer, a qualitative analysis of written responses to open-ended questions related to roles during the illness experience, closeness of relationships, and coping strategies was conducted with a sample of 100 Caucasian, Asian, and Native Hawaiian participants. Results indicate that family members and friends are essential to coping with the effects of the disease, and also that spouses, children, and friends fulfill unique and important roles in facing the illness experience.","Coping with prostate cancer in Asian-American, Native Hawaiian, and Caucasian families.",2009,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The purpose of this study is to illuminate the changeover process experienced by people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and increase the understanding of social recognition occurring after injury. Fifteen persons, ages 28-56, with TBI have been in-depth interviewed. Data were first analyzed by latent-content analysis using a hermeneutic approach, and later re-contextualized within a matrix constructed from theories of social recognition. Results were initially structured into six themes and then re-described in terms of recognition, that is, the individual dimension, the legal dimension, and the value dimension. The conclusions suggest that people with TBI experience both recognition and non-recognition during the recovery process and later in life, living in society with the sequel of TBI. Such experiences are described on all dimensions.",Adults with acquired traumatic brain injury: a theoretical analysis from a social recognition perspective.,2009,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Two statistical methods were compared to identify key factors associated with long-stay nursing home (LSNH) admission among the U.S. elderly population. Social Work's interest in services to the elderly makes this research critical to the profession. Effectively transitioning the &quot;baby boomer&quot; population into appropriate long-term care will be a great societal challenge. It remains a challenge paramount to the practice of social work. Secondary data analyses using four waves (1995, 1998, 2000, and 2002) of the Health Retirement Study (HRS) coupled with the Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) surveys were conducted. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model were performed and compared. Older age, lower self-perceived health, worse instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), psychiatric problems, and living alone were found significantly associated with increased risk of LSNH admission. In contrast, being female, African American, or Hispanic; owning a home; and having lower level of cognitive impairment reduced the admission risk. Home ownership showed a significant effect in logistic regression, but a marginal effect in the Cox model. The Cox model generally provided more precise parameter estimates than logistic regression. Logistic regression, used frequently in analyses, can provide a good approximation to the Cox model in identifying factors of LSNH admission. However, the Cox model gives more information on how soon the LSNH admission may happen. Our analyses, based on two models, dually identified the factors associated with LSNH admission; therefore, results discussed confidently provide implications for both public and private long-term care policies, as well as improving the assessment capabilities of social work practitioners for development of screening programs among at-risk elderly. Given the predicted surge in this population, significant factors found from this study can be utilized in a strengths-based empowerment approach by social workers to aid in avoiding LSNH utilization.",Factors associated with long-stay nursing home admissions among the U.S. elderly population: comparison of logistic regression and the Cox proportional hazards model with policy implications for social work.,2009,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The purpose of this study was to obtain information on the perceptions of persons with diabetes regarding participation in a tele-health program.

Allied health professionals, such as nursing staff, tend to have a better understanding of the medical social worker's role and of whether services are being provided to best meet each patient's needs. We aimed to illustrate the abilities of nursing staff to provide patient satisfaction feedback to medical social workers in such areas as responsiveness to patient requests and the satisfaction of patients and their family members with the social services provided. Use of this satisfaction measurement technique will hopefully resolve any confusion that patients, and others not familiar with the role of the medical social worker, may have.

We report on sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with obesity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus in an ethnically/racially diverse sample of people with ID in New York City. Administrative and chart review data were collected from a community-based specialty medical practice for people with intellectual disabilities. Adult subjects were included if they had an intellectual disability, lived in the community either independently or with relatives, received all of their planned, outpatient health care services though this practice, and had a primary care visit within the study period. One hundred twenty-six (43.0%) persons were obese, 58 (19.9%) had hypertension, 77 (26.5%) had hypercholesterolemia, and 13 (4.5%) had diabetes mellitus. Age, gender, and BMI (for the latter three conditions) were the most consistent risk factors. Intellectual functioning and behavioral problems were not associated with greater odds of these conditions. This study provides crucial information for improving community-based primary care for people with intellectual disabilities. Specifically, these findings highlight the importance of constructing innovative strategies to mitigate chronic disease risk factors in this population that involve community-based case management service providers who can help adults with ID and their families adopt needed lifestyle and behavior changes.",Factors associated with obesity and coronary heart disease in people with intellectual disabilities.,2009,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This article focuses on the realities poor women living in Georgia face in the pursuit of employment. The inquiry focuses on 107 women (84.1% African American, 15.9% white) who were respondents to a survey undertaken by the Welfare Reform Project in Georgia to predict the participants' self-reported confidence in leaving welfare. Predictors of confidence to leave welfare involved health, age, welfare dependency, educational attainment, race, and number of children at home. Health was the strongest predictor, followed by age. Based on Bandura's social cognitive theory, findings suggest that the confidence of female welfare recipients may be greater than can be justified by the realities of their lives and the society in which they live.

The present study compares parental stress and perceptions of parental competence among mothers and fathers of preterm infants two months after discharge from the NICU in Israel with those of parents of full-term infants. The findings show that even at this point in time parents of preterm infants still show higher levels of parental stress and lower perceptions of parental competence than do parents of full-term infants.

Because HIV risk has been associated with partner violence (Maman et al., 2000), it is important to examine self-perceived risk and actual sexual risk behaviors among partner violence victims. Findings are from a study of adult women (N = 569) who were recruited from courts after they had obtained a protective order against a male intimate partner. Two groups were developed on the basis of self-reported perceptions of risk of HIV at the time of the interview (n = 341, no chance; n = 228, some to high chance). Three main findings from this study are discussed: (1) The number of sexual partners and illicit drug use were associated with women's self-perceived risk of HIV; (2) sexual behaviors within the relationship with the abusive partner were not associated with self-perceived risk; and (3) severity of physical violence and frequency of threatened or forced sex in the abusive relationship were not associated with self-perceived risk of HIV.

A total of 475 migrant workers from four major districts in Shanghai were recruited for a survey through multistage cluster sampling. The results suggest that migration stress, particularly financial and employment difficulties, difficulties in interpersonal relationships, and social companionship support contributed substantially to the mental health of both male and female migrant workers. Although instrumental support significantly influenced the mental health of male migrants, esteem support significantly influenced the mental health of female migrants. In addition, although social support did not exert any mediating effect on the mental health of both male and female migrant workers, social companionship support appeared to moderate the migration stress and mental health of female migrant workers. Sociocultural factors are put forth as explanations for these findings. The implications of this study include the provision of workshops and counseling and the strengthening of informal support networks for migrant workers.",The functions of social support in the mental health of male and female migrant workers in China.,2008,United States,Health Soc Work"The present review was undertaken to explore recent evidence in the professional literature pertaining to use of hospice services by African Americans. The article addresses the research methods that have been used to study African American hospice use, obstacles to African American participation in hospice that have been identified, and interventions designed to increase the number of African Americans using hospice services that have been tested. Results indicate that both qualitative and quantitative methods have identified the following key factors that contribute to the underuse of hospice services by members of the African American community: personal or cultural values in conflict with hospice philosophy, lack of awareness of hospice services, concern about burdening family, economic factors, mistrust of the health care system, and expected lack of ethnic minority employees in hospice agencies. Implications for future social work research and practice with terminally ill African Americans and their families include efforts to quantitatively determine whether the identified key factors contribute significantly in the decisions they make regarding end-of-life care.

The authors performed a systematic critical review of published articles by social workers on African American suicide and suicidal behavior, to ascertain the state of social worker's contribution to and knowledge of suicide risk factors and effective treatments. They conducted Web-based (for example, Social Work Abstracts, PsycINFO, PubMed, JSTOR) and manual searches of suicide research conducted by social work investigators and published in peer-reviewed journals from 1980 to 2005. References cited in the articles were used to identify candidate articles.

This article reports on a sample (n = 24) of men who identify their motivations behind their pursuit of seroconversion. Respondents were asked to identify what motivations were connected to their attempt to become seropositive. Three general variables emerged as potential indicators: (1) seeking relief from emotional HIV fatigue, (2) the wish to be closer with one's HIV positive partner, and (3) the expectation to become HIV positive. By identifying these possible motivations (both psychological and sociocultural), sex educators and therapists providing counseling to the gay male community may be better equipped to more effectively identify clients at high risk for intentional seroconversion.

Evidence suggests health care providers, including social workers, do not consistently discuss this topic with patients. This study used a qualitative, cross-sectional design using a focus group and in-depth interviews to explore knowledge, attitudes, barriers, and behaviors related to social workers' discussion of fertility preservation with cancer patients. Factors that influence the discussion of fertility preservation among social workers include: (1) Knowledge (e.g., Fertility Preservation Resources); (2) Attitudes (e.g., Cost, Perceived Role, Comfort Level, Fertility Preservation Discussion Difficulty/Priority); (3) Barriers (e.g., Cost, Urgency to start Treatment/Time, Patient Factors, Physician Attitudes/Beliefs); (4) Behaviors; and (5) Suggestions.

This study asked young women with elevated risk of developing hereditary breast or ovarian cancer (HBOC) how their family histories with cancer and their gene status inform meaning construction around cancer risk and family development. Twenty-three women aged 22-35 who carry a BRCA gene alteration completed illness genograms and open-ended, narrative interviews. Transcripts were analyzed using the Listening Guide, a narrative tool that emphasizes key themes, meanings, and relational structures. Data analysis revealed distinct priorities for (1) single versus partnered women and (2) women who wished to have children versus those who had completed childbearing or were not intending to have children. Findings suggest single women experience increased urgency at finding a life partner capable of handling the emotional strain of the cancer world and open to pursuing multiple paths toward parenthood. Further, participants' family experiences shaped beliefs about perceived time to achieve desired family goals, specifically having biological children, before a cancer diagnosis or the need for preventive surgery.

At this time, most individuals who are under 45 years of age will never witness a seizure. Thus, their information about what seizures are comes from depictions in film and on television. Because especially on television these fictive and often erroneous images are increasing, many think of them as accurate. The research addresses three questions in relation to these images: How do directors use the images? Why do uses of seizures in visual media not reflect contemporary scientific knowledge? Why have they persisted and increased in use? Data consist of material from 242 films and television episodes. The general category of seizures includes seizures in characters said to have epilepsy or some other condition, seizures related to alcohol/drug use, feigned or pseudoseizures, and a &quot;throwaway&quot; category. The research demonstrates how epileptiform events drive the narrative, support the genre, evoke emotional reactions, highlight traits of characters with seizures, accentuate traits of other characters through their responses, act as catalysts for action, and enhance voyeuristic experience. Through connecting categories, we explain a basic social process (Glaser, 2007). The conclusion is that these images are so enthralling that their use is likely to persist. The authors suggest that advocates acknowledge this and then find ways to have more continuing characters with correctly depicted epilepsy be part of television series as a way of exploring the truly enthralling dimensions of the condition.",Truly enthralling: epileptiform events in film and on television--why they persist and what we can do about them.,2008,United States,Soc Work Health Care"A supplementary educational model (SEM) was developed and evaluated in order to expand educational opportunities for social work students, to enable a professional interaction for field instructors and to connect the academia teachers to the field.

Medical record review and semi-structured interviews generated descriptive and qualitative data for 18 African-American enrollees in a PACE program located in a large eastern city of the United States. Review of verbalized and documented preferences for end-of-life care among participants indicated that most preferred life-sustaining treatments. In addition, findings suggest that these PACE enrollees had limited information or understanding of the interventions and terminology associated with advance directives. Content analysis of interviews indicated that end-of-life decision making was influenced by the desire to maintain usual activities of daily living; to avoid burdening caregivers; and to remain in control of personal health care. Furthermore, these African-American elders relied on faith in God as central to medical decision making, believing ultimately that God controls the end of life. This research may enhance the ability of social workers, in collaboration with other members of PACE or similar interdisciplinary teams, to understand the values and attitudes associated with the preferences of older African Americans for care at the end of life.

This study examined the intention of using home support and long-term care facilities by a random sample of 339 Chinese-Canadian family caregivers, using a modified version of the Andersen-Newman service utilization model. Filial piety, caregiving burden, care receivers, and health conditions are the common predictors identified. Filial obligation is most likely manifested through facilitating the care receivers to make use of the services needed, particularly for caregivers who reported a high level of caregiving burden.",Intention of use of long-term care facilities and home support services by Chinese-Canadian family caregivers.,2008,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The main purpose of this study is to explore the project management methodology as a practical solution for the field of long-term care management.

The new program offered same-day co-located mental health, medical, and homeless services with a coordinated intake system. The program is analyzed using a framework proposed by Rosenheck (2001) that has four phases: the decision to implement, initial implementation, sustained maintenance, and termination or transformation. GLA was able to successfully implement a new program that remains in the sustained maintenance phase five years after the initial decision to implement. Key factors from the Rosenheck innovation model in the program's success included coalition building, linking the project to legitimate goals, program monitoring, and developing communities of practicing clinicians. The key lesson from the case study is the need for a coalition to persistently problem solve and act as advocates for the program, even after successful initial implementation.

Analyses examine the ways that two program implementation practices (emphasis on quick job entry and personal client attention) are associated with program impacts on parents' depressive symptoms. Effects vary by the age composition of the parents' children, such that programmatic emphasis on quick job entry is associated with increases in depression among parents with preschool-age children but not among parents with school-age children.

Exercise is an effective stress-management tool and is important for physical health. The number of Hispanic women who engage in enough exercise is low. Thus, promoting exercise for this population is of critical importance. Individual effectiveness of behavioral interventions can often be lost in group analyses. Therefore, we employed both group analyses and single-system methodology to test the effectiveness of an exercise program for 25 Hispanic breast cancer survivors. Measures of physical fitness, quality of life, self-reported stress, and salivary cortisol were taken repeatedly before, during, and after the intervention. The intervention improved physical fitness, reduced perceived stress, and decreased cortisol levels as evidenced by both group and single-system analyses.",Using single-system analyses to assess the effectiveness of an exercise intervention on quality of life for Hispanic breast cancer survivors: a pilot study.,2008,United States,Soc Work Health Care"OBJECTIVE: Encourage older African-American women to participate in breast cancer detection. Breast cancer deaths for older African-American women are higher than for Caucasian counterparts. Effective outreach education about mammography and breast exam is one method to reduce the disparity by encouraging women to enter treatment earlier through earlier diagnosis. Traditional outreach strategies have proven ineffective with this cohort.METHOD: In this study we utilized the trust placed in known community leaders to recruit older African-American women to participate in breast health education leading to completion of a mammogram. One hundred sixty-two women were identified as participants.RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of the women who completed the project obtained mammograms and 9% had mammograms scheduled at 1-month follow-up, whereas 22% of the individuals who received only mailed educational materials completed mammograms and none had scheduled mammograms pending.DISCUSSION: Health education for difficult-to-reach populations can be effective but requires greater inclusion of community partners to offset issues related to trust, health beliefs, and access.",P.O.W.

Support group attrition or non-attendance was positioned as resulting from both individual and group factors. Individual factors included resisting or leaving behind a cancer patient identity, presence of existing support, practical issues, and styles of coping. Group factors included mismatches between the group and the individual, lack of knowledge or nonreferral to groups, and problems within individual groups. These disparate factors underlying support group non-attendance need to be taken into consideration when planning support services, when developing programs of education, or when referrals to cancer support groups are made.","A qualitative analysis of reasons for leaving, or not attending, a cancer support group.",2008,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study examined the impact of social worker staffing on depression and health-related quality of life (QOL) of end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis.

From 27 items a principle component analysis identified seven factor variables that investigated perceptions of health concerns, health-related vulnerability, importance of spiritual/religious belief, social worth, cognitive capacity, fitness, and being old. Respondents believed that at age 75 they would have many health concerns, would be fit, have social worth, and would be somewhat religious/spiritual. Although most did not believe they would be as capable at 75 as they are now, most respondents did not believe that at 75 they would be vulnerable (a victim of crime, lonely, live in a nursing home, need assistance with bathing or dressing, or have Alzheimer's disease). The factor variables were entered in a standard multiple regression analysis with Perceptions of Health-Related Vulnerability as the dependent variable. The final model accounted for 54.6% of the adjusted variance using five predictor variables: (a) Perceptions of Health Concerns, (b) Perceptions of the Importance of Spiritual/Religious Beliefs, (c) Perceptions of Social Worth, (d) Perceptions of Cognitive Capacity, and (e) Perceptions of Being Old.

Moreover, infants are unable to recognize connections between their behavior and punishment and to modify their behavior in response. However, pediatricians and other health care professionals do not frequently discuss the issue of infant spanking with parents. Meanwhile, parents are increasingly seeking parenting information from other sources including the Internet and lay parenting books. Using content analysis methodology, online parenting sites and popular &quot;how to&quot; parenting books were reviewed with regard to the advisability of corporal punishment with infants. Results reveal that although the vast majority of online and popular print literature on infant parenting is developmentally sound, a small constituency of spanking advocates does exist.

Social work and other helping professions need to find ways to learn from sufferers, to listen to their stories, deriving insight from their knowledge, in order to more effectively attend to their health care needs. Findings from a doctoral dissertation using a narrative &quot;testimonial&quot; methodology, framed within a postmodern anti-oppressive ideology, will be presented.

Those who reported difficulties meeting basic needs, diabetes-related complications, worse subjective health, and dissatisfaction with medical care were more likely to report worse QoL. Those who reported difficulties meeting basic needs, higher cholesterol level, and worse subjective health also were more likely to report better QoL in the hypothetical absence of diabetes. In addition, diabetes management played a major role in one's QoL in the hypothetical absence of diabetes: Engaging in stricter diabetes self-care and taking pharmaceutical treatment for managing diabetes were associated with better QoL in the hypothetical absence of diabetes.

The survey instrument included descriptive information on shelter service delivery. Specifically, questions were asked about the practice of assessing a client's risk of HIV/AIDS, the provision of HIV/AIDS educational and prevention programs within shelters, and information about organizational characteristics that facilitate or impede the existence of these services. The findings suggest that shelters lacked sufficient HIV/AIDS policies and programs to respond to their client's heightened risk of infection. Although 19 (90.5 percent) of the shelters reported that they routinely ask about their clients' sexual abuse histories, there was no link between a woman's disclosure of sexual abuse and a subsequent provision of appropriate HIV/AIDS services (referrals for testing, treatment) by the shelter.

Mothers' realities were explored through three levels of social organization: daily caregiver coping (micro level); community views of SCD, such as stigma (meso level); and systemic SCD health care provision (macro level). Through the use of population health and structural social work perspectives, mothers' experiences were examined in the context of perceived gender and racial oppression. Saturation was achieved after initial interviews with 10 participants and a four-month postinterview with half of the participants. Mothers commonly reported several daily coping challenges: fear of their children's death, separation anxiety, loss of control over life, helplessness, and loneliness/isolation. SCD stigma interacted with racism, contributed to social isolation, and prevented families from organizing as a group. All mothers perceived racism as a salient factor behind inadequate mainstream SCD health care. Recommendations to improve SCD health care and implications for social work practice and research are discussed.

Content analysis performed by interdisciplinary authors identified four domains--Rewards and Consequences of Spina Bifida, Journey Toward Acceptance of Spina Bifida, Emotional Climate of Siblings, and Qualities of the Social Environment--that depict emotional complexity in response to the diverse risk and protective influences present in the lives of siblings. By bolstering the siblings' strengths and resources found in their adaptive coping mechanisms, spirituality, cohesive family ties, and supportive peer friendships, social workers and other health care professionals may help them to successfully navigate the intense and confusing emotions that may naturally spring from the challenges and opportunities associated with SB.",Risk and protective influences in the lives of siblings of youths with spina bifida.,2008,United States,Health Soc Work"Parenting twins is typically portrayed as more stressful than is parenting single children and, therefore, more of a strain on the marital relationship. With this in mind, the present study examined the contribution of infant characteristics and mother's internal resources (attachment style) and external resources (maternal and paternal grandmothers' perceived support) to their marital adaptation during the first month following delivery, comparing mothers of twins (n = 88) with mothers of singletons (n = 82). The findings indicate that both internal and external resources contribute to the marital adaptation of the two groups, even beyond the contribution of specific circumstances. Thus, it seems that the birth of twins and the birth of a single child are normative life events that have more in common than previously acknowledged.

The authors carried out a prospective study of 1,426 adult patients discharged from 11 acute care hospitals in Israel. Social workers provided detailed discharge plans on each patient. Telephone interviews were conducted two weeks post-discharge. Findings showed 40 percent of patients were referred to institutional care and 60 percent were sent home with plans to receive community services. At follow-up, the rates of implementation varied by planned services. Among patients referred to institutional care, 46 percent of those referred to nursing homes and 70 percent of those referred to rehabilitation facilities received the planned care. Of those discharged home, 65 percent received planned home attendant services and 59 percent received planned home health care. Implementation of institutional care was related to the patient's functional status and population group.

The analysis of data from experiments suggests that employment-based programs have no effects on economic well-being among the least-disadvantaged low-income, single-parent families, but they have positive effects on employment and income for the most-disadvantaged and moderately disadvantaged families. These programs increase school achievement and enrollment in center-based child care of children only in moderately disadvantaged families.

The World Health Organization (WHO) uses supervisors (nurses, nursing assistants, and community health workers [CHWs], as well as community members and relatives), to watch the patient take his or her TB medication. This article explores the observation component of DOTS, and how DOTS supervisors enhance patients' ability to comply with TB treatment by providing enablers, education, and supportive relationships. It also explores how supervisors can achieve the balance between patients' right to self-determination and a community's need for social accountability. Social work can contribute to the efficacy of TB treatment by helping public health officials understand the importance of balancing patients' rights and society's needs in determining the allocation of program resources. The results of this study are based on data gathered from 71 researcher-administered questionnaires and 25 semi-structured interviews in seven of the Kingdom of Lesotho's 19 health service areas.

The establishment of medical social service in a health setting has more than 100 years of history in the USA and more than 60 years in Hong Kong. Despite the increasing popularity of Chinese Medicine (CM) used by the Hong Kong people, there has been no medical social service presence in the CM system. A pilot project demonstrated a successful interdisciplinary collaboration model between social work and CM irrespective of different social work methods, that is, individual work, groupwork, and community-based services. In this article, we will relate the opportunities and difficulties that we encountered in setting up the first medical social service in the CM system. Drawing on our experience, we found that both professions benefited from the interdisciplinary collaboration. CM was able to expand its scope of service to increase the service quality and promote primary health care in the community with the support of social work. Conversely, social workers found that CM is a good resource for providing innovative services to meet the various needs of the people in the community. There was also a ripple effect of incorporating CM elements into social service. The interface between the disciplines of social work and CM can widen the scope of their contributions on health.

This is the first small-scale exploratory study in Northern Ireland that sought to identify the key factors that hospital social workers perceive as impeding their practice in the discharge planning process. A 15-item postal questionnaire was developed and distributed to 30 hospital social workers from four hospital social work departments in a city in Northern Ireland. The study group comprised social workers based in a range of hospital directorates who had differing levels of hospital social work experience. Data generated from the questionnaires suggested that deficits in community resources impacted most negatively on social workers' practice in discharge planning. The length of time respondents had been in their current post was also shown to influence their responses to the perceived impediments in their discharge planning role.

It relies on iterative interviews with individuals and groups, as well as on court observations from one metropolitan area. Results suggest that, consistent with theories of street-level bureaucracy, efficiency issues drive mental health service use, as clients are routinely subjected to psychological evaluations and funneled into mental health services as a matter of course. Referral practices are shaped by child welfare professionals' routines, discretion, and desire to meet such system objectives as providing short turnaround times for reports. The results suggest that, despite stakeholders' best intentions, maltreated children are not benefiting from thoughtful processes geared to screen for, assess, and provide targeted treatment for unmet mental health needs.","Funneling Child Welfare Consumers into and through the Mental Health System: Assessment, Referral, and Quality Issues.",2008,United States,Soc Serv Rev"Research suggests that an individual's personality traits may mediate the relationship between social support and mental health. This study uses two national data sets to test a conceptual model that integrates personality, social support, negative interactions, and psychological distress. Results suggest that, beyond the influence of personality, social support is negatively associated with psychological distress, and negative interactions are positively associated with such distress. The findings also suggest that personality has direct and indirect effects, through social support and negative interactions, on psychological distress.

Seventy-five older adults with SMI were recruited from a community mental health center to participate in the study. The typical client experienced a need for care in 10 areas, with the greatest needs occurring in the areas of psychological pain, physical illness, social contacts, looking after the home, and daily activities. The total number of unmet needs ranged from zero to 10, with the typical client having an average of 2.3 unmet needs (SD = 2.4). The highest proportions of unmet needs were in the areas of social contact, benefits, sight or hearing difficulties, and intimate relationships. Linear hierarchical regression analyses revealed that clients with lower income, greater impairments in independent daily living skills, and higher levels of depression experienced increased needs for care. Older clients who lived in private homes or apartments had higher levels of depression, and those who required assistance in the areas of intimate relationships and benefits experienced higher levels of unmet needs.

The authors investigated role overload as these siblings' stress factor, anxiety and psychosomatic symptoms as their duress responses, and self-control (SC) and self-efficacy (SE) as their coping resources. Participants comprised 100 (53 boys and 47 girls) Israeli Jewish healthy siblings (ages 8 to 19 years) of a child with cancer. Outcomes revealed that the stress experienced by healthy siblings ofa child with cancer correlated significantly with those siblings' duress responses: Greater role overload was linked with higher levels of state anxiety and more psychosomatic symptoms. Likewise, these siblings' stress factor correlated significantly with one of their personal resources: Greater SC was linked with lower role overload. Furthermore, personal coping resources correlated significantly with healthy siblings' duress responses: Greater SC and SE were linked with lower levels of anxiety and fewer psychosomatic symptoms. In addition, hierarchical regression analyses showed that, among children older than age 12, greater SC was linked with milder anxiety. Limitations and implications are discussed.","Self-control, self-efficacy, role overload, and stress responses among siblings of children with cancer.",2008,United States,Health Soc Work"Although the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has changed dramatically over the past 25 years, addressing the psychosocial needs of patients living with HIV/AIDS remains vital. Ensuring the effective delivery of services demands that interventions be rooted in cultural competence and aimed at vulnerable populations. This article describes a group intervention designed for Latino patients living with HIV/AIDS in NewYork City. The intervention effectively integrates culturally competent practice with traditional social work practice with groups' skills to provide an arena for participants to explore issues commonly faced by patients living with HIV/AIDS in a cultural context. Case examples are used to describe themes that emerged during the intervention, which illustrate cultural influences on issues such as adherence, social isolation, stigma, disclosure, safer sex practices, and patient-provider communication. Cultural factors inherent to Latino culture that are known to influence a patient's health experience and the development of effective interventions are also presented. The identification and explanation of these factors is intended to help social workers and other health care professionals better understand the roots of Latino patients' beliefs and understanding of their HIV/AIDS condition as well as highlight some of the obstacles they cause.",Cultural competence in a group intervention designed for Latino patients living with HIV/AIDS.,2008,United States,Health Soc Work"Throughout the Midwest and the southern United States, new groups of Hispanic/Latino and other immigrants are settling in large numbers.

Using a phenomenological, qualitative research approach, the authors interviewed 12 purposefully selected living kidney donors (eight men and four women), who were between four and 29 years since donation. Interviews were audiotaped, and transcribed verbatim, and the analysis of the data was both iterative and interpretive. Three key themes emerged. The first was how witnessing their loved ones' experience of illness and the threat of losing the recipient influenced the participants' decision to donate. The second focused on intrapersonal (philosophy of life) and interpersonal factors (comprehensive social support networks) that influenced the decision to be tested as a potential donor and the actual process of donation. The third was the impact of giving the gift of life, which was emotional and life changing. This article provides a rich description of the experiences of living kidney donors, revealing the multiple factors influencing the decision to donate, and provides insight on how social workers and other health care professionals need to identify and address the psychosocial needs of living kidney donors and their families from the process of decision making through after donation.",The experience of living kidney donors.,2008,United States,Health Soc Work"Chronic dialysis imposes ongoing stress on patients and staff and engenders recurring contact and long-term relationships. Thus, chronic dialysis units are opportune settings in which to investigate the impact of patients' relationships with staff on patient well-being. The authors designed the present study to examine the degree to which perceptions of open communication between patients and staff affect patient mental health. A one-year, two-wave longitudinal survey assessed patient (N = 109) perceptions of the interpersonal environment and mental health. Assessments included sharing personal information (open disclosure), assisting one another (helping), staff respect for patients (respect), and hierarchical patient-staff relations (formal staff authority). Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression analyses examined how these characteristics of the interpersonal environment relate to depression and subjective well-being among patients. Multivariate analysis showed that open disclosure correlated independently with lower levels of depression at baseline (N = 109) and a predicted significant decrease in depression over time (N = 64). Other interpersonal characteristics did not correlate with depression or subjective well-being at baseline or longitudinally. The interpersonal climate in chronic dialysis units influences patient well-being.

It explicitly investigates how the relationships between substance use and the factors vary across different racial and ethnic groups. Findings suggest many common correlates and processes of substance use for adolescents, regardless of race or ethnicity, including that neighborhood safety is associated with substance use. There are also some racial and ethnic group differences in relationships, including that low attachment to and lack of social opportunities in neighborhoods more strongly predict substance use among whites than among other racial and ethnic groups and that family management decreases the relationship between neighborhood safety and substance use among African Americans. A better understanding of the associations among factors that influence substance use across racial and ethnic subgroups can help effectively target preventive interventions for different groups.","Neighborhoods, Family, and Substance Use: Comparisons of the Relations across Racial and Ethnic Groups.",2008,United States,Soc Serv RevOBJECTIVE: The present study has two goals: to assess the difference between secondary trauma and job burnout and to examine the utility of secondary trauma in predicting psychological distress. METHOD: The data come from a survey of social workers (N = 236) living in New York City 20 months following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC). RESULTS: Social workers' involvement in WTC recovery efforts is related to secondary trauma but not burnout. Analyses also reveal that both secondary trauma and burnout are related to psychological distress after controlling for other risk factors.

This study explored the effects of three types of parental influences-parental monitoring of the child's whereabouts, degree of parental permissiveness, and the strength of parental injunctive norms discouraging substance use-on alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and anti-drug norms. Results showed that parental permissiveness and parental injunctive norms, particularly anti-drug injunctive norms, had the strongest effects on the substance use outcomes, but parental monitoring generally was not a significant predictor. These results and implications for prevention are discussed in light of Mexican cultural norms toward substance use, gender roles, and family roles.","Effects of Parental Monitoring, Permissiveness, and Injunctive Norms on Substance Use Among Mexican and Mexican American Adolescents.",2008,United States,Fam Soc,Forty-four techniques for empowering older adults living with diabetes.,2008,United States,Health Soc Work,The Human Genome Project: implications for families.,2008,United States,Health Soc Work"This article explores the predictive ability of empathy (measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index), emotional separation (measured by the Maintenance of Emotional Separation Scale), occupational stress (measured by the Work-Related Strain Inventory), and social support (measured by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) on secondary traumatic stress (STS) (measured by the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale) in hospital social workers. This cross-sectional study used a sample of 121 trauma center social workers who were predominantly master's-level prepared women with an average of 15.8 years' experience.

Secondary data analysis was performed with National Survey of Self-Care and Aging interview data from 3474 respondents age 65 years or older. Falls were reported by 24 percent of respondents, fear of falling was reported by 22 percent of respondents, and both increased with age. Fear of falling was the most important factor in predicting activity avoidance among older adults; the number of falls experienced increases the impact that fear of falling has on activity avoidance. Other factors were as follows: needing help with activities of daily living and the number of prescriptions taken. Assessments of older individuals should include fear of falling and fall history. Reductions in fear of falling and increases in activity level could provide significant benefits by helping older adults to maintain functioning and the ability to live independently.",Fear of falling and activity avoidance in a national sample of older adults in the United States.,2008,United States,Health Soc Work"This article reports the findings of a qualitative study on the contribution of foster home caregivers for people with serious mental illness. Traditionally, social workers have played a key role in the supervision of foster homes. Little is known about how the help caregivers provide is similar to, or different from, that provided by mental health professionals. Twenty semistructured interviews were conducted with caregivers operating foster homes in Montreal, Canada. With no preset theoretical framework, data analysis was inductive and ongoing, involving the identification of categories and themes. Overall findings revealed that caregivers consider themselves the real frontline workers. They claim to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to combine egalitarian and affective relationships with their residents and to provide them with personalized care. Caregivers are well positioned to respond immediately to crises. Caregivers also believe that their intimate and thorough familiarity with their residents allows them to assess residents differently than could social workers. These findings have implications for mental health professionals.

This article examines both the prevalence of IPV among a sample of women ages 50 to 64 (N=620), who were recruited at an emergency department and primary care clinics in an urban setting, and the associated factors for the subsample of these women who reported IPV (n=34). More than 5 percent of the women reported experiencing some form of abuse by their partners within the past two years. Bivariate analyses comparing victims and nonvictims indicate that higher proportions of women who reported abuse had received public assistance and had a recent history of homelessness. In addition, victims of IPV reported higher frequencies of HIV risk factors than did nonvictims, including having a partner who insisted on sex without a condom, having sex with a man they knew or suspected was an IV drug user, and experiencing symptoms or receiving a diagnosis or treatment for a sexually transmitted infection. Significantly higher percentages of abused women reported being tested for HIV and being HIV seropositive.

Participants included 125 HIV-positive women enrolled in a larger, longitudinal study of HIV disclosure and mental health. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the proposed theoretical models. The disease progression model contained two single-indicator exogenous variables (disease progression) and one endogenous latent variable (disclosure). The original consequences model contained two single-indicator exogenous variables (disease progression), two single-indicator endogenous variables (consequences), and one endogenous latent variable (disclosure). The revised consequences model contained two single-indicator exogenous variables (consequences) and one endogenous latent variable (disclosure). The results of this study support the revised consequences theory and an earlier claim that disease progression may not be a direct predictor of HIV disclosure.

Depression interferes with both individual and social functioning that can lead to persistent problems in healthy human development, social relationships, and empowerment in the service of social justice. Attention to the salubrious effects of religious involvement on the psychological well-being among older U.S. racial and ethnic groups is still in its nascent stage. This article examines the relationship among religious involvement, private prayer, and depression in a low-income clinical sample of 230 older U.S.-born and immigrant Latinos. Higher levels of religious attendance were associated with lower risk of depressive illness after adjusting for selective factors such as physical functioning, stress exposure, and social support. Private prayer was not associated with depression. Although immigrants were more likely to attend worship services, they reported the same rates of depression as their U.S.-born counterparts.

States adopting the FVO agree to screen for domestic violence, refer identified victims to community resources, and waive program requirements that would endanger the women or with which they are unable to comply. The analyses find that none of the 10 clients in this study received these services. This lack of services reflects four critical disjunctures between the formal policy and the policy experienced by the clients. It also reveals several more basic structural factors that provide conflicting mandates to frontline workers.

Interactions with professionals might be one such factor and especially experiences of positive encounters. The purpose of the study was to identify and analyze sick-listed persons' experiences of positive encounters with professionals within social insurance and healthcare. An inductive and descriptive qualitative approach was used to analyze transcripts from 11 semi-structured interviews with persons with experience of long-term sickness absence. The following five categories of qualities of encounters were found to be of importance: being treated with respect, feeling supported, establishing a personal relationship, perceiving demands as well-balanced, and participating in decisions regarding rehabilitation measures. Several interviewees expressed the opinion that positive encounters with professionals can promote RTW. Further research is needed to elucidate the aspects of interactions that enhance empowerment and self-confidence in persons on sick leave, in order to develop professional treatment strategies that facilitate RTW.",Encouraging encounters: sick-listed persons' experiences of interactions with rehabilitation professionals.,2008,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of hope and internal locus of control on the health and well-being of older women of Mexican origin who have been diagnosed with cancer. The study was conducted using data from Wave 2 of the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiological Study for the Elderly (H-EPESE), a survey of 3050 Mexican American elders living in five southwestern states. To examine the effects of locus of control and hope on self-reported health, somatization, negative affect, and restriction of activity as dependent variables, we applied multiple regression (OLS) analysis to a sub sample of 109 women who reported having a diagnosis of cancer. We used four models to sequentially assess the effects of control variables, locus of control plus control variables, hope plus control variables, and both locus of control and hope plus control variables on each of the four dependent variables. The results indicated that locus of control was significantly associated only with three of the four dependent variables and hope was significantly associated with more favorable outcomes for each of the dependent variables.

An index of chronic inflammation (viz., C-Reactive Protein) is as good a predictor of heart attacks as are fats in blood. The data suggest that stressful events are so closely associated with chronic inflammatory states, that the body's stress response can be viewed as an inflammatory state. This paper summarizes and explains the link between stress and cardiovascular disease. Negative health outcomes, particularly for cardiovascular diseases, are higher among those of lower socio-economic status. Differential stress among socio-economic tiers is considered as an explanation for the disparities. The literature linking cardiovascular risk factors to the stressors of workplace unfairness and lack of control over working conditions is reviewed. The role of the stressor of racism in explaining the higher rates of cardiovascular mortality in African Americans is discussed. Finally, for societies with wider gaps in income between the rich and the poor, increased stress is explored as a possible explanation for the diminished health outcomes found across all socio-economic tiers.

METHODS: Using A-CASI technology, data was collected from 559 detained adolescents on demographics, family factors, peer influences, religiosity, witnessing community violence, and drug and sexual risk behaviors. RESULTS: Controlling for demographics and family variables, findings indicated positive associations between witnessing community violence and drug and sexual risk behaviors. Witnessing community violence was directly linked to sexual risk behaviors, and indirectly associated with these risk behaviors, through gang membership and perceived risky peer norms. Additionally, witnessing community violence was indirectly linked to substance use through gang membership and perceived risky peer norms.

This exploratory study uses an administrative data set (N = 280) from five programs in central Ohio to examine four areas: demographics, health and mental health, financial and social resources, and disenrollment status. Older adults with diabetes were more likely to be African American and younger than other clients; had more diagnoses, limitations with activities of daily living, and hospitalizations; and were at greater nutritional risk at intake. These older adults also relied more on public funding, primary caregivers from the immediate family, and transportation assistance, and they paid less for participation in the day program. The two groups did not differ in length of program stay or reasons for disenrollment.

The current study surveyed 223 case managers providing services to people living with HIV/ AIDS in NewYork State. The survey was conducted anonymously, and case managers were sampled at the agency level. Results showed that two-thirds of case managers routinely discuss disclosure issues with their HIV-positive clients. However, case managers often felt that they lacked the resources to provide assistance with disclosure decisions, and 66 percent of those who routinely discuss disclosure issues had not received training in assisting with disclosure to sex and injection drug-sharing partners. HIV disclosure issues were also seen by case managers as only one of many pressing issues facing their HIV-positive clients; other pressing issues were housing, food, medical care, mental health treatment, and preventing HIV transmission.

A Women's Writing group and Women's Assertiveness group each with 10 sessions were designed and conducted according to this model. The group leader presented as a pedagogue and self-object that created a group experience that affirms humanistic values and fosters self-growth, socialization, and interpersonal change. The results of a self-administered survey suggest that the participants responded favorably to the format, structure and content of the groups, skills learned, and the identification of past and present issues.","Empowering women with chronic, physical disabilities:a pedagogical/experiential group model.",2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Caregivers of individuals with end-stage dementia experience increased grief reactions; however, their grief is too often over-looked by health professionals. Regardless of their practice setting, social workers must assess and intervene with caregivers dealing with grief. This article provides information on the Marwit and Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI) that was designed to measure the grief of caregivers of individuals with progressive memory loss. Through the use of case examples, key areas of assessment are highlighted, as well as initial areas for helping caregivers cope and heal from their experiences of grief.",Caregiver grief in end-stage dementia:using the Marwit and Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory for assessment and intervention in social work practice.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study examined the overall life satisfaction of personal care workers (PCWs) delivering dementia care in elderly day care centers in Hong Kong. A total of 142 PCWs participated in the present study. Regression analysis results showed that self-efficacy in dementia care was a robust predictor for PCWs' life satisfaction. Female gender, perceived adequacy of training, low staff to client ratio, and high emotional support from colleagues predicted a high level of self-efficacy. To promote a higher level of life satisfaction among PCWs, it is essential for organizations to enhance their sense of self-efficacy. Providing PCWs with adequate training that address areas specific to their perceived needs is of utmost importance in achieving this goal.",Factors associated with life satisfaction of personal care workers delivering dementia care in day care centers.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The goal of this project was to establish the feasibility of linking a practice-based research network of Adult Protective Service (APS) workers to an academic institution. To determine whether this newly formed APS research network was feasible, a qualitative research project was attempted with network members who had e-mail. An e-mailed single case study with three questions sent to the 356 network members yielded a 31% return rate. APS workers suggested 73 different ideal and actual services for the case study abuse victim. Half of the respondents were unable to implement the ideal service. Barriers were predominantly financial, victim and daughter cooperation, and availability of resources. It is realistic and feasible to establish an adult protective service research network with an interdisciplinary academic research team.",APS participatory network case study review.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"As treatment options have improved, there has been a significant increase in the life expectancy of HIV-infected children and adolescents. For most adolescents, the time comes when it is appropriate to transition from pediatric care to an adult or community-based provider. In response to a program closure, a transition readiness scale was developed. A total of 39 caregivers of HIV-infected youth (ages 10-18) and 12 youth over the age of 18 years were interviewed at two time points. Barriers associated with transition were identified and addressed between visits. Transition readiness improved and state anxiety decreased significantly from the first time point to the last visit (approximately 7 months later). Not having a home social worker was the most reported concern/need identified. Barriers to transition and interventions utilized to assist with transitioning care are discussed.",Transition from a pediatric HIV intramural clinical research program to adolescent and adult community-based care services:assessing transition readiness.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study examined bereavement among a group of faculty following their return to work at the university. A phenomenological approach was undertaken in an attempt to understand the faculty's experience of bereavement after returning to work following the death of a significant family member. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted with seven individuals who had experienced the death of a husband, a parent, a sibling, or grandparent. The findings support two main positions: (1) the grieving process may go unrecognized due to the demands and challenges inherent in the university setting, and (2) the university setting may also play a supportive role for returning faculty. Although physical and emotional responses are normal reactions to grief and loss, the faculty's perception of their experience suggests that their role and work responsibilities complicate the bereavement process. Two faculty respondents also found the university environment helpful and supportive despite occasional disregard from some coworkers. Implications for social policy, future research, university administrators, and faculty are discussed.",Bereavement among faculty members in a university setting.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to compare stress appraisals, coping strategies, social resources, and burnout at work between social workers, psychologists and nurses; and (2) to assess the effectiveness of appraisals and support in reducing burnout and enhancing effective coping strategies. Questionnaires containing assessments of work stress appraisals, coping strategies used to deal with problems at work, and social support at work, as well as burnout measures of exhaustion, depersonalization, and accomplishment were completed by 249 female professionals (age range 25-61). No differences were observed between the three professions on most psychological measures, except for the depersonalization outcome of burnout, which was significantly lower among psychologists than among nurses or social workers. High challenge/control appraisal of the job was directly related to all burnout outcomes, contributing to less exhaustion and depersonalization and to more personal accomplishment. The challenge/control appraisal was also negatively associated with emotion-focused coping. By comparison, the stress/load appraisal contributed to more exhaustion at work, while emotion-focused coping contributed to higher depersonalization. Social support was associated with higher challenge/control appraisal, with the latter mediating support effects on burnout. These data suggest that the perception of challenge/control in one's work may be an important factor in preventing work burnout in the three professions tested in the study.","Burnout, social support, and coping at work among social workers, psychologists, and nurses: the role of challenge/control appraisals.",2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Menopause is a natural process that occurs in women's lives as part of normal aging. Many women go through the menopausal transition with few or no symptoms, while some have significant or even disabling symptoms. The purpose of this paper is to describe the menopausal symptom experience of 135 urban methadone-maintained midlife women between the ages of 40 and 55 years. A cross-sectional survey comprising sample characteristic questions and a 14-item menopause symptom checklist was administered. Ninety-six percent reported one or more symptoms with a mean of 6.2 symptoms. Symptom reporting was found to be relatively high, with more than half of the sample reporting hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbances, joint pains, and fatigue in the two weeks preceding the survey. However, the psychological symptoms (irritability and depression) were the two most common symptoms in this sample. This study documents a relatively heavy burden of symptoms in an aging cohort of methadone-maintained women. The physical and psychological impact of aging and, in particular, the experience of menopause in these women is rarely studied and poorly understood. This gap in critical knowledge is further complicated by the remarkable similarity of many symptoms associated with menopause and opiate withdrawal. Aging, drug-related health problems, and poor access to health care further complicate the picture and underscore the importance of better integration of health care with social work intervention.",Exploring the prevalence of menopause symptoms in midlife women in methadone maintenance treatment.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"While information handouts are commonly used in healthcare education, this paper is about social workers systematically developing and using them to provide timely, efficient, and ultimately better patient care for concrete services and discharge planning. How to identify topics and suggestions for composing user-friendly handouts are discussed. Many clinical uses for handouts are considered including: engaging, assessing, and empowering patients, groups, and families. Related uses are considered such as educating the treatment team and students. How handouts can be a crucial bridge to developing a comprehensive, focused social resource database is considered. Follow-up survey results with an inner city VA social work staff (N= 41) confirm that social work discharge planners and non-discharge planners find systematically developed handouts valuable for providing efficient, better patient care.",A systematic approach for providing concrete services and discharge planning based on using information handouts.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Despite a nearly 20-year-old legislation to strengthen social work (SW) coverage within nursing homes and decades of literature exploring the need for SW training, untrained and undertrained social workers dominate American nursing homes. Many persons who call themselves social workers are not educated as such, but nevertheless, must work in complex, conflict-ridden nursing homes without assessment and advocacy skills essential to address the symptoms and to fully respond to subjugated residents' needs. The call for more qualified social workers to be employed in nursing homes is a recognition that the residents' psychosocial needs are not being met. We examine how inconsistent national requirements, inadequate professional educational preparation, and work overload are all symptoms of a general societal unwillingness to recognize residents' needs. The authors utilize a morphogenic systems perspective to describe the open interaction between all disciplines, which can be unduly strained without properly trained workers.

Although occupational-related skin disease is a common condition, it is not considered to be a serious one and, therefore, has not received satisfactory attention in the psycho-social literature or in the social work profession. In our study, 70 occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) patients were interviewed by telephone regarding psychological, social, economic, and subjective issues related to the disease. All patients reported to be affected in their daily living activities, self-image, economic status, and in their interpersonal relationships in the family.

One such vulnerable group is elderly patients who have been shown to have multiple, chronic health problems. The current fiscal environment favors shortened lengths of stay, potentially leaving these vulnerable patients at risk for adverse outcomes upon discharge, especially for those discharged home as opposed to institutional settings. The purpose of the study was to characterize the biopsychosocial risks for adverse outcomes in the elderly patients discharged home from Guelph General Hospital (Ontario, Canada). The objectives were to (1) estimate the number of elderly people who indicate biopsychosocial risk for adverse outcomes, (2) determine the specific risks and their severity, and (3) estimate the number of readmissions to hospital within three months after discharge. Standardized, self-reported scales were used to measure risks in elderly patients at discharge from acute care medical and surgical units. The sample included 62 patients with a mean age of 79 years. At discharge almost 40% of the patients were considered at risk for adverse outcomes, 11% indicated depression, 45% indicated psychological distress, 13% showed cognitive impairment, and 62.5% (35/56) had at least one nutritional concern. Over the three-month follow-up period, there were 23 readmissions, 8 ED visits (not mutually exclusive), and 7 outpatient visits. The mortality rate over the three-month period was 5% (3/62). Many elderly patients who were discharged from hospital to home experienced several challenges medically, psychologically and some also experienced social adversities. The implication is that these patients may benefit from a more comprehensive discharge plan than is currently practiced that addresses their challenges.",Psychosocial profile of elderly patients discharged from a community hospital.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study addresses the fit between social work education and practice in health care. A random sample of NASW members identifying with health care (N = 179) responded to a mail survey about the utility of core knowledge and roles that we had identified by reviewing seven commonly used health care social work texts. Quantitative data revealed knowledge and roles most frequently used in health care settings as well as differences in roles used dependent upon department name; and different professionals supervising social workers. Qualitative data from four open-ended questions provided suggestions for what knowledge and skills should be taught in social work programs, the best forums/methods for teaching this content, and topics for continuing education. Findings are discussed in relation to six key areas of the peer-reviewed literature: vulnerable populations/diversity, ethical dilemmas, interdisciplinary collaboration, mental health, managed care/accountability, and advocacy.

This article presents the process of selecting and revising the Profile of Adaptation to Life (PAL) into a screening instrument that identifies the hospital's most vulnerable patients who need to have a full psychosocial assessment completed by the social worker. The PAL was selected because it includes identifiable risk factors across the psychosocial spectrum, is cost-effective, and easy to administer and score. Factor analysis and reliability analysis resulted in a promising instrument, the Profile for Adaptation to Life-Medical (PAL-M), for use in rapid, psychosocial risk screening with medically ill patients.

Thematic analysis was utilised on data from in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 18 experienced health care social workers. The findings demonstrated that adjustment was conceptualised as a complex, multi-dimensional process including the key interrelated themes of coping, emotion, subjective meaning, adaptation, support, family-focus, and process orientation. The findings can assist social workers in conceptualising their practice and articulating their role with clients and with other health professionals in relation to crucial adjustment issues identified in health care settings.",Evaluating Adjustment to Health Condition and Adjustment to Hospitalization as indicators for intervention in Australia.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This article describes the development of a proposed unifying theoretical framework for the concept of adjustment as understood by health social workers. This arose from an exploratory study (Nilsson, 2002) aimed at elucidating social workers' understanding of Adjustment to Health Condition and Adjustment to Hospitalisation as Indicators for Intervention. The findings of that study demonstrated that adjustment was conceptualised as a complex, multi-dimensional process including the key inter-related themes of coping, emotion, subjective meaning, integration, adaptation, support, family focus, and process orientation. Participants were, however, unable to identify a unifying meta-theory to explain the described critical inter-relationships between these concepts. The proposed explanatory framework is based substantially on Folkman's (1997) revision of Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) theory of 'coping as a mediator of emotion' and also incorporates important aspects of family systems theory as described by McCubbin and McCubbin (1996).

This study investigated the potential differences between African Americans' and white college students' current and future sexual behaviors and safer sex behaviors with HIV/AIDS awareness, condom use self-efficacy, and safer sex attitudes. A convenience sample of 156 college students from three public universities was used. Of those who were sexually active, more African American than white respondents reported they used condoms frequently, and more African Americans indicated they would use condoms regularly in the future. No racial differences were found in intentions for future casual sex, condom use self-efficacy, or attitudes toward safer sex practices. Although the results suggest that for this sample African American college students appear to have internalized safer sex messages to a greater degree, both groups reported a lack of consistent safe-sex practices, which may put them at risk of HIV/AIDS.",HIV/AIDS knowledge and sexual activity: an examination of racial differences in a college sample.,2007,United States,Health Soc WorkThis article examines social justice issues affecting breastfeeding in the United States.

Using mixed methods, this two-stage study explored caregiver grief during a terminal illness and after the care recipient's death. Caregiver grief was a state of heightened responsiveness during end-stage care: anxiety, hostility, depression, and trouble concentrating, remembering, and getting things done. Following the death, caregiver grief became a state of sustained reactivity: Overall distress was diminished and anxiety and hostility decreased significantly, but loneliness, sadness, and tears increased. Overwhelming responses were triggered by unforeseen visual or auditory reminders of the person. Sleep disturbances began during end-stage care and continued after the death. At both times, caregiver grief was highly influenced by the social context; relationships with family and friends (more cohesive versus conflicted) shaped responses. Social work practitioners can help caregivers who may be unaware they are experiencing grief to identify and integrate these normal responses to loss.",Caregiver grief in terminal illness and bereavement: a mixed-methods study.,2007,United States,Health Soc Work"This study examines the demographic and physical and mental health characteristics of social work clients among cancer patients in Canada as compared with nonusers of social work services, and factors that affect use of social work services among cancer patients.

The number of Canadians with cancer who consulted social workers about their physical, emotional, or mental health increased from 31,005 to 36,427 over the study period. Results indicate that cancer patients who used social work services were in need of social support or were members of vulnerable populations. Patient's age, living arrangement, income, depression status, and physical limitations were significant predictors of service use.

Depression was defined as scoring three points or higher on the eight-point Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. The results show that respondents age 75 years or older with one ADL/IADL impairment or more were significantly less likely to be depressed than were those between ages 55 and 64 with the same degree of functional impairment. It is recommended that doctors, social workers, and other health care and social services providers pay special attention to younger old adults with health problems and functional limitations because they have a greater risk of being depressed.",Age group differences in depressive symptoms among older adults with functional impairments.,2007,United States,Health Soc Work"Coping theory and research have long focused on negative outcomes. However, a growing body of literature has indicated that individuals may experience certain benefits from stressful life events.

Fifteen participants with either high or low scores of posttraumatic growth were interviewed. Data were analyzed from a grounded theory standpoint using open, axial, and selective coding. All of the individuals interviewed were undergoing or had undergone a process of finding meaning in their bereavement, in HIV disease in general, or both. Themes of distress, growth, humor, support, spirituality, fear of death, and the intertwining of support and spirituality emerged from the data.

It explores, from the conventionally neglected patients' perspective, their definition of hope, factors that cause changes in their hope and roles that the formal service providers can play to instill hope in patients. All the respondents who participated in this study were diagnosed with terminal cancer and were staying in Dover Park Hospice, a hospice in Singapore for the terminally ill. The results reveal that there is greater diversity in the definition of hope among patients in Singapore compared with the definition given by patients from the studies with a non-Asian sample. Support from people, religion, acceptance of illness, and knowledge of self in better condition as compared with others were four factors found helpful in promoting hope while absence of family members led to a decrease in hope. There were three main roles performed by the formal service providers that were perceived as useful in instilling hope among terminally ill patients. They were that of (1) a care provider, (2) a provider of emotional support, and (3) a wish fulfiller. In the final analysis, the study seems to suggest that spiritual and relational hopes, together with open and honest communication between patients and family members, are very important strengths for Singaporeans diagnosed with advanced illness.",Hope among terminally ill patients in Singapore: an exploratory study.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This article reports on the findings of a qualitative study exploring the impact of SARS on social work practice in five different hospitals in Singapore.

This paper uses the biopsychosocial model to identify predictors of employment for 411 individuals transplanted at a single, large Midwestern academic center. Less than 50% of respondents reported part-time or full-time employment post-transplant. Factors found to predict employment were age at the time of transplant, race, sex, and patient perception of physical functioning. Individuals who were younger when transplanted, Caucasian, and males were more likely to be employed full-time following transplantation as were those who perceived themselves to have a higher level of physical functioning. No biological factors, including serum creatinine, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and diabetic status, were significant predictors of employment.

Participants were 123 family caregivers in rehabilitation settings in South Korea that replied to the survey. The needs were measured by the Family Needs Questionnaire (FNQ) and the t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze collected data. In the comparison of two rehabilitation phases, the family caregivers caring for their patients in the acute rehabilitation phase perceived the need for health information as more important than those in the postacute phase. In addition, the family caregivers caring for patients in the acute rehabilitation phase were less satisfied with community network support and family support than those in the postacute phase. In the comparison of treatment settings, family caregivers caring for their patients in outpatient clinic services showed the lowest satisfaction of their needs in four areas (health information, emotional support, instrumental support, and professional support) compared with those in inpatient facilities or day hospitals.

In the present study, ratings by mothers who received the culturally sensitive intervention were compared with ratings from a control group on their experience of the preterm birth, and the quality of their social support. Additionally, mothers who received the intervention also rated their comfort with social interactions in general, and with their support giver, as well as the qualities (e.g., supportive, friendly) of the support giver. The intervention was delivered in a metropolitan city in Canada with a considerably diverse population, for example, 41% spoke a mother tongue other than one of the two official languages (English and French) and 37% were a visible minority. Mothers with a preterm infant in the neonatal intensive care unit who agreed to participate were matched on language, culture, ethnicity, and characteristics of their infant to a volunteer, trained support giver with experience of preterm birth. Results indicated that the intervention helped mothers to feel more confident in their parenting, understand the medical condition of their infants, and experience greater quality of their listening support than control mothers. Intervention mothers also reported comfort interacting with people in general, and especially with the support giver.

The sample consisted of a total of 64,722 patients admitted to the &quot;med-surg&quot; hospital unit over a two and one-half year time period from 2002 to 2004. Of the total patients in the sample, 15.7% (n = 10,156) had social work involvement. Sixty percent of the social worker patients were age 70 or over compared with the mean age of the sample of 56.2 years. The mean length of stay for social work served patients was 11.4 days (sd = 13.9) compared to 4.3 days (sd = 6.3) non-social work patients, a difference that was significant (t =-68.3; p = .000). The authors attribute the longer lengths of stay to social workers' receiving older and more difficult-to-place patients. An evidence-based case is made for the cost-containment value of social workers in hospitals and for the creation of a tracking infrastructure to aid in monitoring the daily achievements of medical/surgical social workers.",Evidence that supports the value of social work in hospitals.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Social workers in health care have been urged to identify the nature of their expertise and to articulate profession specific roles (Peckuconis et al., 2003). This paper reports on the use of a theory of professional expertise (Fook, Ryan, &amp; Hawkins, 2000) in management and clinical practice within two Australian hospital social work settings. This theory, directly applicable to social work, was applied within these hospitals to differentiate levels in social work industrial awards, in staff selection, in supervision and continuing professional development.

This study investigates the capacity of adolescents on the verge of emancipation from the child welfare system to navigate this transition. To explore heterogeneity in adolescents' preparation for independent living, person-oriented methods are applied to a large, representative sample of youth about to exit foster care. The analysis suggests four subpopulations defined by distinctive profiles on indicators reflecting multiple domains of life experience. Identifying the particular needs and challenges of subpopulations has implications for efforts to match adolescents aging out of the child welfare system with appropriate services.",Approaching the Transition to Adulthood: Distinctive Profiles of Adolescents Aging out of the Child Welfare System.,2007,United States,Soc Serv Rev,HIV and AIDS today: where is social work going?,2007,United States,Health Soc Work,Metropolitan Community AIDS Network: faith-based culturally relevant services for African American substance users at risk of HIV.,2007,United States,Health Soc Work,Evidence-based practice and social work: an illustration of the steps involved.,2007,United States,Health Soc Work,Custody planning with families affected by HIV.,2007,United States,Health Soc Work,Telephone technology in social work group treatment.,2007,United States,Health Soc Work"For many survivors of serious road trauma, the physical and psychological consequences are complex and lifelong. The longer-term psychosocial recovery experience for survivors, however, is rarely documented in the social work literature. This article reports on findings from a study of road trauma recovery experiences. The findings are presented in relation to posttraumatic growth and posttraumatic stress experiences, as measured by the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and the Impact of Event Scale. Data were collected from 79 anonymous self-administered postal surveys from participants who had received treatment in an Australian rehabilitation center following serious orthopedic injury. One-third of these survivors continued to experience serious psychological distress in the aftermath of road trauma and a range of other psychosocial consequences four years after their accident. Although 87 percent of the sample continued to experience posttraumatic stress difficulties, 99 percent reported experiences of posttraumatic growth.

Little is known about which individuals are especially protected against the emergence of postpartum depressive symptoms during this time. Using a &quot;risk and resilience&quot; theoretical framework, we expected that optimism during pregnancy would be associated with less postpartum depression severity, controlling for antenatal depressive symptoms. We also predicted that optimism would buffer the relations between four dimensions of stress frequency during pregnancy (financial, spousal, physical, and occupational) and the development of postpartum depressive symptoms. Using data from three panels of a longitudinal study of married couples across the transition to first parenthood, we found that optimism of expectant mothers during pregnancy was associated with decreased depression severity at six months and 12 months postpartum. The data also showed that when women experienced high frequencies of financial, spousal, and physical stress during pregnancy, those who were optimistic were much less at risk of developing clinically significant depressive symptoms at six months and 12 months postpartum compared with those who were pessimistic.

A PHP identifies associations among such factors as gender, income, employment, and social support and their potential effect on health outcomes. A PHP also recognizes physiological and pathological manifestations of the body such as stress (mental or somatic) and individual biological parameters (for example, glucose levels) as health determinants. AL uses an aggregate score of individual biological parameters as a health measure that is exacerbated through repetitive movement of physiologic systems under stress. The social work profession should incorporate knowledge of both PHP and AL into its theory and practice domains for effective care of vulnerable populations such as single-parent families.","Allostatic load: single parents, stress-related health issues, and social care.",2007,United States,Health Soc Work,President Bush's health care reform proposal: a social work perspective.,2007,United States,Health Soc Work"Studies carried out in different countries have shown that there is a lack of a common and up-dated knowledge base in social work, and that social workers make use of research in their everyday practice only to a very limited extent. On the other hand it has been shown that social workers feel they need knowledge but not necessarily in the form it is produced by the researchers. This paper explores issues of knowledge and competence in health social work based on the results of a survey and a focus group interview conducted among social workers in Finland. According to the results, social workers in health care do feel they need new knowledge. Some significant differences were found in the way health social workers view the acquisition and maintenance of professional competence and in the way they seek knowledge, when compared to social workers working in the municipal social services.",Knowledge and social work in health care - the case of Finland.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study evaluated a dyadic peer support pilot intervention for parents of technology-assisted children with chronic lung disease. These medically-fragile children, living at home in the primary care of their parents, require continuous or intermittent assistance from technological support such as home oxygen, respiratory or cardiac monitors and/or mechanical ventilators. The intervention consisted of matching parents with similar caregiving responsibilities, in order to reciprocally engage in parent-to-parent support. Results identified mixed outcomes based on quantitative and qualitative methods. Participants conveyed benefits and limitations of this modality of peer-based support. They generally favoured peer support as a clinical resource for caregiving parents as the intervention offered a valued opportunity for mutual sharing with another parent who could understand the unique realities particular to caring for a medically-fragile child. Sharing daily experiences was reported to reduce isolation, increase knowledge, and provide an important sense of feeling understood. Challenges associated with peer support included scheduling difficulties and personality incompatibility. Recommendations for program development in clinical settings are described.",An evaluation of dyadic peer support for caregiving parents of children with chronic lung disease requiring technology assistance.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Advances in technology have improved access to health and social services by offering more abundant and convenient choices for clients. In particular, the use of technology for delivering services to older adults and their families offers new possibilities for service delivery, by reaching people who are often isolated, and have difficulty accessing traditional services. Despite the continued advances in technology development and its integration into healthcare delivery, health care practitioners need to consider how to adapt and uphold clinical practice standards and address ethical issues in an e-health environment. Given the gap in the literature with respect to discussing these issues, this paper illustrates relevant issues in the context of developing and evaluating an Internet-based intervention for spousal caregivers of persons with dementia. Based on a four year project, a psychotherapeutic group intervention was delivered via the Internet to three groups of spousal caregivers. This article identifies some of the key practice standards and ethical issues that arise when using computer technology to deliver a psychotherapeutic group intervention. The article will also provide examples of relevant issues related to maintaining practice standards and ethical procedures that need to be addressed during the application of a computer-based psychotherapeutic group intervention for spousal caregivers of people with dementia.",Clinical practice standards and ethical issues applied to a virtual group intervention for spousal caregivers of people with Alzheimer's.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study identifies perceived outcomes following hospitalized children's participation in a pediatric online support network. Nineteen participants were interviewed, including child and adolescent patients who had used the network while in hospital, their parent/family caregiver, and a familiar health care provider. This triadic sampling approach provided a range of stakeholder perceptions. Results convey a wide spectrum of benefits and challenges in accessing and utilizing an online support network for hospitalized children. Participation in the network was identified as a means of fostering pediatric patient enjoyment, education, connection with peers, and coping. Information, social connection and distraction served as catalysts fostering positive outcomes for children. Identified barriers to network participation included inaccessibility and limited availability of computers, issues with technology, and discomfort with online interaction.

Based on a theoretical model relating attitudes and behavior, this study examined the association between physicians' self efficacy in counseling diabetic patients on life style behaviors and their counseling practices. Data were gathered from a representative sample of 743 primary care physicians in Israel's two largest health plans. The main findings were that only a small percentage of physicians felt capable of influencing their patients' life-style behaviors. Self-efficacy had an independent effect on the likelihood of counseling diabetic patients on life style behaviors, controlling for other background variables. We conclude that there is a need for enhancing physicians' life-style counseling skills, and that social workers could expand their role by training physicians to counsel effectively. This could both improve the care of diabetic patients, and strengthen the status of the social work profession in the healthcare system.",Physicians' ability to influence the life-style behaviors of diabetic patients: implications for social work.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper aims to describe the implementation of a Neonatal Hearing Screening Program in a school hospital, focusing on the return rates among infants who failed the first screening. The population who goes to the school hospital for health services comes mainly from economically underprivileged groups. Even though our previous return rates were comparable to those reported elsewhere, we felt it was important to improve the methodology of the screening process in order to try and obtain better results. Our hypothesis was that scarce knowledge on early hearing loss detection and on the benefits of early intervention could be reasons for mothers to give less importance to the second screening. So, a strategy was developed around the idea of providing very detailed information to the mothers about the screening process since preliminary data, gathered with a different group of in-patients, had shown that mothers possessed little knowledge about neonatal hearing screening and the consequences of hearing loss for children's development. The no-return rates decreased considerably (from 39.8% to 25.8%). The findings of this research showed both the need of an adequate way of imparting information to the mothers of newborns about hearing screening in economically underprivileged populations, and the role of social work in this process. Without adequate knowledge on hearing screening and the consequences of hearing loss, a high percentage of newborns may not take advantage of free universal hearing screening programs.",Improvement of return rates in a Neonatal Hearing Screening Program: the contribution of social work.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Less than optimal treatment adherence for many health conditions impedes clinical progress, leading to increased morbidity, mortality and health care costs, particularly for low-income and racial and ethnic minority patients. When properly understood as a complex phenomenon involving patient, provider, and health system interacting factors, adherence improvement is a natural target for social work's multi-system model of case management.

This paper explores the literature relating to diversity in the workplace and then describes an urban Canadian teaching hospital's comprehensive approach to the promotion of an equitable and inclusive diverse environment. With this goal, four years ago the hospital established an office of Diversity and Human Rights staffed by a social worker. The office provides education, training, policy development and complaints management. The administration also convened a hospital-wide committee to advise on the outcomes, and to plan a process for diversity and human rights organizational change. The committee worked with a social work research consultant to design a qualitative focus group study, currently ongoing, to explore the perspectives of hospital staff. The lessons learned from the process have the potential to increase overall cultural competency of staff that can translate into more sensitive work with patients.",Does difference matter?

Some strategies adopted to improve services to non-English speaking populations include the use of bilingual social workers, interpreters and printed translation tools. In order to identify gaps in culturally sensitive care in a Canadian teaching hospital, this study surveyed a consecutive sample of 279 Chinese in-patients to determine satisfaction with hospital experience, levels of information about hospital routines and awareness of on-site Chinese cultural services. Results were generally positive. However, satisfaction and information levels were significantly higher among those patients who were aware of culturally appropriate Chinese resources such as social workers, cultural interpreters, and culturally specific reference tools. Of particular interest are the 121 patients (44%) who were less comfortable with English, since awareness of culturally specific resources tended to make a greater difference to this sub-group. These results can potentially help health care providers improve services to patients and families from diverse cultural and linguistic groups.",Do culturally sensitive services for Chinese in-patients make a difference?.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"UK government policies over the last decade or more have focussed on giving older people more voice in the design, delivery and assessment of services. Mirroring these trends, there has been a shift towards increased involvement of older people in the research process. Drawing on three research studies, this paper examines the contribution of social work to an inter-disciplinary research agenda designed to promote increased involvement of older people in issues of service quality in primarily health settings. Challenges and opportunities are discussed. Each of the studies illustrates the importance of promoting research practice congruent with social work's commitment to partnership and empowering forms of practice. This, it is argued, requires the challenging of ageist assumptions, the use of a range of research methods and the valuing of different forms of knowledge.",Promoting older people's voices- the contribution of social work to inter-disciplinary research.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"With the ageing of the global population, the wellbeing of older people in different parts of the world merits special attention. However, recent findings on certain aspects of the psychosocial health of the elderly are far from reassuring. The first problem is the inconsistency in psychosocial indicators, which give simultaneous high life satisfaction scores and high suicide rates. The second problem is the significant weakening of the social support network of the elderly. This article analyses the service and policy implications of these two problems. Suggestions are then made on the role of social workers in promoting the psychosocial health of the elderly at different levels of intervention, which include the individual level, the family and social network level, the community level and the international level.",Promoting the psychosocial health of the elderly- the role of social workers.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"RATIONALE: A purportedly heterogeneous group of people, who come to take tests at the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Test-ing Clinic, includes young males and females who lead a normative lifestyle with no unique characteristics. Within this population, we have observed one distinct subgroup of predominantly male individuals, who return from time to time to take the HIV tests. They tend to partake in many occasional sexual encounters with numerous partners, and despite their obvious knowledge of the risks involved, they attest to not using condoms during sexual intercourse. The aim of this preliminary study was to investigate the patterns of their risky behavior in conjunction with their test taking conduct.METHODS: Ten self-referred volunteering subjects were recruited.EXCLUSION CRITERIA: HIV-positive, drug and/or alcohol abusers, mentally ill, men who have sex with men (MSM) and minors. The study was carried-out using semi-structured interviews (40-90 min each). The interviews were recorded, transcribed and content analyzed.FINDINGS: Data analysis showed several possible explanations for risky sexual behavior, such as applying of a variety of risk management mechanisms, refraining from impulse control behaviors, and self-destruction motives. The reasons for undergoing HIV testing were most frequently related to specific events, high-risk in nature, and not part of a routine behavioral practice.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings might suggest that within this population group, the prevailing primary preventive interventions would not satisfy the purpose of decreasing levels and frequency of risk-taking behaviors. In the opinion of the authors, there are two strategies that could be employed, simultaneously or separately. An indirect approach entails the increase and enhancement in utilizing widely spread media, e.g., feature films and television programs, to convey issues related to curbing risk-behavior. Direct emphasis should be put on secondary preventive measures, by encouraging frequent test-taking conduct, preferably accompanied by counseling, in order to decrease the risk of further transmitting the virus.",An investigation of the practice of unsafe sex yet repeated HIV testing.,2007,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The HIV/AIDS epidemic has impacted all levels of society from the individual to the macro-economic. The continuing spread of infection around the world means that traditional methods of care and support are put under extreme pressure and many families lose their capacity to cope. Social workers are involved in providing care, counseling and support to those affected, and in developing programmes and other interventions to prevent the spread of the disease. Prevention and behaviour change are vital, but access to treatment is an ethical imperative, particularly in developing countries where the epidemic is most prevalent. Social work is a profession uniquely situated to demonstrate leadership in multi-sectoral collaboration in responding to this pandemic. Consequently this paper briefly reviews the scale and current nature of the epidemic and then considers how social workers can help build more compassionate policies at an international level. Social workers can help to create awareness of the negative effects of poverty, tackle gender inequity, help build more effective coalitions and partnerships, and work with other concerned groups and organisations to end stigma and discrimination. Using case examples the paper considers how social workers can help develop caring strategies that improve the lives of those living with HIV and AIDS.","We care don't we?

Successful practice in today's global environment hinges on the ability to accept differences and to work towards a shared future. The necessity of cultural competence is painfully obvious when considering HIV prevention and care. From the start, HIV has been a global epidemic that has devastated many regions of world. The current paper examines the issue of HIV care and prevention from the perspective of Indonesia and the United States. Juxtaposition of these two countries reveals that they have approached HIV care and prevention differently because of their different histories. However, it is advanced that the two countries are likely to have a shared future given the highest infection rates are locating in similar populations, i.e., sex trade workers, intravenous drug users, street children-generally the poor, the oppressed, and their partners.

Earlier studies on access usually focused on types and frequency but failed to address the predictors of service barriers. This study examined access barriers to health services faced by older Chinese immigrants in Canada. Factor analysis results indicated that service barriers were related to administrative problems in delivery, cultural incompatibility, personal attitudes, and circumstantial challenges. Stepwise multiple regression showed that predictors of barriers include female gender, being single, being an immigrant from Hong Kong, shorter length of residency in Canada, less adequate financial status, not having someone to trust and confide in, stronger identification with Chinese health beliefs, and not self-identified as Canadian. Social work interventions should strengthen support and resources for the vulnerable groups identified in the findings.

Most of the youths reported feeling obliged to their parents to stay healthy, and these feelings of obligation were important factors in their decisions to avoid unsafe sex. Youths who reported no parental influence came from families in which parents had historically been preoccupied with personal or marital problems or in which there was a history of parental rejection. On the basis of these exploratory findings, AIDS prevention specialists are advised to recruit parents, assess family relationships, and facilitate parent-child communication in their efforts to encourage gay youths to consistently engage in safer sex practices.","Parental influence, gay youths, and safer sex.",2007,United States,Health Soc Work"Psychological distress was investigated in a group of parents who were current and former recipients ofTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and a group of parents never enrolled in TANF The study focused on two reported symptoms of distress: depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Results demonstrate that receiving or having received TANF benefits worsened parents' psychological distress. On the other hand, becoming employed reduced parents' psychological distress. Furthermore, participants' physical health state was significantly and negatively related to their psychological distress. Reliance on general assistance (before or after leaving TANF) was associated with psychological distress, although other social support variables (such as availability of child care, Medicaid, food stamps, and so forth) had no significant effect on psychological distress among current or former TANF recipients.

Few studies address this relationship in long-term cancer survivorship, however. As part of a study on long-term prostate cancer survivorship, wives' ways of coping with cancer-related issues were explored through longitudinal interviews.This article describes findings from a subset of women who reported SBR use (N = 28). Wives completing a quality-of-life survey were purposively sampled by age and race and ethnicity and invited to participate in semistructured interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using content analysis and grounded theory. Validity was ensured through researchers' consensus, participants' verification, and key informant interviews. Although wives' spiritual beliefs were rooted in diverse traditions, common themes in SBR use were detected. An embracing spirit was the overarching theme, as characterized by acceptance of change, adversity as opportunity for growth, and proactive coping. SBR facilitated adaptation in four core areas: marriage preservation and couple intimacy, personal growth and continuous learning, health-related attitudes and behaviors, and community connections.

The sudden onset of SARS in hospital settings created an immediate necessity to study this phenomenon as hospitals and health care professionals struggle to adapt to this new epidemic environment. This study is the first using qualitative research to investigate the unique perspective of social workers in an epidemic environment.

The initial study sample consisted of 289 people who agreed to participate in a prospective study of substance abuse treatment outcomes in five large outpatient programs in Ohio. The findings reported here are based on analyses for the 141 (48.8 percent of the original sample) individuals who completed a six-month follow-up interview using the short form of the Addiction Severity Index. These data indicate that legally coerced participants were more likely than noncoerced participants to report abstaining from alcohol and other drugs in the 30 days before their follow-up interview. They were also more likely to demonstrate reduced addiction severity at follow-up.

In the course of previous qualitative analyses, the researchers identified stress and coping codes according to behavioral, psychological, and social domains using a grounded theory approach. In the present study, these qualitative data were extracted into a quantitative format and subjected to cluster analysis to better understand stress constellations and coping styles in this population. The analysis yielded five constellation groups: stoics, complainers, taciturns, sentimentalists, and articulates. Cluster analysis of self-reported coping styles yielded five groups that included mavericks, autonomous, pragmatists, hermits, and nonchalants.

This study examines the relationship of productive engagement to the health and observed health disparities of older African American and white adults. Productive activities include formal and irregular paid employment, caregiving, volunteering, and informal social assistance. The authors analyzed longitudinal panel data on individuals ages 60 and older from the Americans' Changing Lives survey with generalized estimating equations methods. Indicators of self-rated health and functional status were regressed separately on measures of productive engagement after accounting for sociodemographic differences and prior levels of health. Analyses were stratified by race and compared. Engagement in productive activities predicts better functional status for both groups, but higher self-rated health only among white adults. Number of activities performed was positively related to both health measures for all individuals, and hours of engagement and the ratio of paid to unpaid hours did not predict health outcomes.",Race disparities in health among older adults: examining the role of productive engagement.,2006,United States,Health Soc Work"This research sought to identify organizational characteristics associated with the amount of professional qualifications among a nationally representative sample of nursing home social service directors. A self-administered survey was sent to directors in 675 facilities randomly sampled from a federal database, excluding facilities with fewer than 120 beds that are not required to staff a full-time social worker. The response rate was 45 percent (N = 299). Univariate results showed that most respondents possessed a social work degree, most lacked licensure, and few were clinically supervised. A multiple regression analysis found that nonprofit, independently owned facilities in rural areas staffed social service directors who were significantly more qualified than directors in for-profit, chain-affiliated facilities in urban and suburban areas. Facilities with fewer psychosocial deficiencies and higher occupancy rates employed social service directors with greater qualifications.

A convenience sample of 193 community-dwelling people ages 85 and older was recruited to examine various aspects of health and well-being between 1986 and 1995. This article reports on the survivors (N = 23) across three time points, waves 1, 4, and 5. The findings suggest that the very old mainly worry about health and memory and that, although worry increased over the study period, there were variations in the pattern of worry over time. Results of t tests show that at wave 4 elderly respondents with a higher level of worry reported more frequent social contact than those with a lower level of worry.

This article examines differences in the association between functional limitations and church attendance in a sample of 987 elderly African American and white individuals. African American and white elderly people without limitations attended church at virtually the same rate (69 percent). Despite their higher scores on religiousness measures, elderly African Americans with one or more limitations were significantly less likely to attend church regularly than were white counterparts. Health status measures did not help explain older African Americans' lower attendance rates. Differences in attendance were associated primarily with educational attainment and cognitive functioning. The article recommends social work intervention to reduce barriers to church attendance for older adults who want to attend services.",Functional limitations and religious service attendance among African American and white older adults.,2006,United States,Health Soc Work,Health care needs of aging adults: unprecedented opportunities for social work.,2006,United States,Health Soc Work"Social workers encounter suicidal clients; however, little is known about social work's empirical knowledge base for suicide assessment and treatment. In the first comprehensive study of social work's contribution to the suicide literature, the authors conducted systematic electronic and manual searches for suicide research published in peer-reviewed journals by social work investigators for the period 1980-2006, with the purpose of ascertaining the state of clinical knowledge related to suicide risk factors and effective treatments. These findings reveal that despite recent increases to the study of suicide by social work researchers, they have contributed limited evidenced-based knowledge in the last twenty-six years on the treatment or prevention of suicide or suicide-related behaviours.

The PHQ was particularly limited in identifying individuals with anxiety disorders other than panic disorder. Seventeen women met SCID criteria for at least one major depressive disorder, 6 (35%) of whom the PHQ failed to identify. The PHQ was particularly limited in identifying depressed individuals with dysthymia.CONCLUSIONS: Caution should be used when screening for anxiety and depression with the PHQ.

To satisfy the need for increased capacity to deliver accessible, affordable, community-based psychosocial counseling for cancer patients and their families, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation developed the Individual Cancer Assistance Network (ICAN) demonstration project. Results of a 3-phase evaluation in diverse community settings in Florida show that ICAN effectively provided &quot;cancer sensitivity&quot;; training for social workers preparing them to deliver short-term individualized psychosocial counseling, on a sliding fee scale, to cancer patients and their families, and to market it effectively to oncologists and the community.",Building community-based short-term psychosocial counseling capacity for cancer patients and their families: the Individual Cancer Assistance Network (ICAN) model.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Qualitative data were collected to determine the impact on children where the sibling have diabetes.

Treatment was either a non-surgical wiring of the teeth closed for six to eight weeks or surgical placement of a metal bone plate in the lower jaw with a short period of jaw fixation following surgery. A mandibular fracture is one of the most common orofacial traumas for minority individuals, and the majority of these fractures among patients at urban trauma centers are a result of interpersonal violence. Thus the link between psychosocial stress and oral health is evident, yet exposure to daily stress does not automatically place one at risk for distress. Some people under daily stress have hardiness, conceptualized as an internal personal resource consisting of control, commitment, and challenge. This study examines hardiness and social support relevant to an underserved, minority population. Hardiness and social support were identified and noted in order of frequency according to participant characteristics of treatment type, gender, and ethnicity. Main themes related to hardiness and social support are highlighted with verbatim quotes providing additional context to the theme presented.","A qualitative study of hardiness and social support among underserved, inner-city minority adults recovering from oral surgery.",2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Data from the Ontario Health Survey were used to examine the relationship between levels of social support and general health, suicidal ideation, family functioning, and utilization of health services among Metropolitan Toronto cultural populations 16-59 years of age (N = 2684).

Results also show that being a visible minority immigrant is not a risk factor for any of the health outcomes considered here. This finding is not in accordance with the notion of social hardship, which visible minority immigrants purportedly experience in a predominantly white society.

For a sample of 2,642 cases, 29.2% of all hospital days were excess days for patients referred to social services. For a sample of 176 social service cases, a stepwise regression yielded two statistically significant predictors of LOS: (1) Medical problem (target LOS) and (2) severity of psychosocial problem (Person-in- Environment scale). The importance of psychosocial severity as a predictor of LOS has clear implications for the role social workers can play in making health care organizations more efficient.","Psychosocial severity, length of stay and the role of social work services.",2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"A 1999 examination of approximately 5000 long-term psychiatric patients in Israel identified 725 as Holocaust (Shoah) survivors. Review of these cases has shown that these patients had not been treated as a unique group, and that their trauma-related illnesses had been neglected in their decades long treatment. We discovered that many of these patients had never openly shared their severe persecution history. We postulated that many of them could have avoided lengthy if not life-long psychiatric hospitalization had they been able to openly share that history. Instead, those gruesome and traumatic experiences remained encapsulated, split-off, causing the survivor to lead a double-life. These patients may physically inhabit the world as psychogeriatric patients, though emotionally they may remain in adolescence or childhood due to early traumatic experiences. Some twenty-six patients at two institutions gave consent to be interviewed by a professional team and have their testimonies recorded on videotape. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of video testimony as a potential useful psychotherapeutic clinical intervention. By videotaping testimonies of these patients' experiences before, during, and after World War II, we had created highly condensed texts that could be interpreted on a multiplicity of levels going far beyond the mere narrative content of clinical medical history. Joint observation, reiteration, and discussion of these testimonies with staff members and the patients themselves has been not only an interesting experience, but also one of therapeutic value yet to be fully appreciated.","Psychiatry, testimony, and Shoah: Reconstructing the narratives of the muted.",2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This commentary presents personal reflections on the Social Work Leadership Enhancement Program in the Department of Social Work Services at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.

The development of the role and its integration into the mainstream disaster response has progressed over the last two decades. Recent international events have given affirmation to the importance of this role. The development of national and state based Disaster Management Plans in Australia began in the mid 1970's. Recognition of the need for experienced, skilled workers to provide emotional support, practical assistance and grief and bereavement counselling has resulted in the inclusion of social workers in several key parts of the disaster management response including the specialised area of Disaster Victim Identification. Following the Bali Bombing in October 2002, social workers worked with the Police Missing Persons Unit to provide support to families and facilitate the collection of ante mortem information. The process by which new services come about can be intricate and complex. In the field of health social work, the contribution of international programs such as the Mt Sinai Leadership Enhancement Program cannot be underestimated. As the Social Work Director of Westmead Hospital, one of the largest hospital social work departments in the country, participating in this program provided opportunities to share professional experience with international colleagues, many of whom are experts in their field.

None of the participants was directly exposed to terrorist attacks, but they all lived with the possibility of daily terror. The research focused on fear as the most common and widespread reaction to terror and war. Short-term and long-term symptoms of fear were studied. It was found that an additional terrorist attack had no significant influence on children's emotional, cognitive, or behavioral spheres. Terror that has become habitual becomes negligible.

It examined whether psychosocial variables (appraisal of caregiving, mastery, social support and coping) mediate the differences in psychological distress between these two groups. A total of 213 veteran resident and 206 immigrant (from the former Soviet Union) caregivers of chronically ill elderly were recruited from health services. The comparisons between the two groups were examined separately for spouse and adult child caregivers. The immigrant spouse and adult child caregivers reported significantly higher levels of caregiving stressors than veteran resident caregivers, but psychological distress was significantly higher only among the immigrant adult child caregivers. In multivariate analyses, the difference in psychological distress disappeared when caregiving stressors and mediating psychosocial variables were included in the regression models. Different caregiving stressors and psychosocial variables were associated with psychological distress among the spouses and among the adult child caregivers. The findings suggest that the caregiving stressors and psychosocial variables explain differences in psychological health outcomes between veteran resident and immigrant caregivers. Social work interventions should address these factors among caregivers, take into account the relationship to the care recipient, be culturally adapted to the immigrant caregivers, and target immigrant adult child caregivers in particular.",Caregiving stressors and psychological distress among veteran resident and immigrant family caregivers in Israel.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper outlines a 22 year campaign to introduce openness into the arena of donor conception in the UK.

Donor conceived people may find themselves in families which enjoy material privilege but whose exposure to a legislative framework and dominant professional cultures within the treatment centres encourages secrecy around genetic origins. Social workers' experience of adoption and family work leads them to recognise the danger of such secrets within families.

Pre/post episode utilization was compared via paired t tests with individuals as their own controls. Logistic and OLS regression as well as repeated measures ANOVA via the GLM SPSS program and post hoc t tests were used to evaluate between group and across time differences.RESULTS: Extended episodes of care for both groups were associated with reduced use of hospitalization and increases in outpatient services. Extended orders did not promote voluntary participation in the post-period. Outpatient services during the extended episode for those on orders were raised to the level experienced by the treatment compliant comparison group and maintained at that level via subsequent renewal of orders throughout the patients' careers. OLS regression results indicate that approximately six community care service days were required for those on orders to achieve a one-day reduction in hospital utilization following the extended episode.CONCLUSION: Outpatient commitment for those on extended orders in the Victorian context enables a level of community-based services provision, unexpected in the absence of this delivery system, which provides an alternative to hospitalization.",Extended outpatient civil commitment and treatment utilization.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This article introduces the Strength-focused and Meaning- oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation (SMART) as a model of crisis intervention, which aims at discovering inner strengths through meaning reconstruction.

Thirty youths, ages six to 12, whose parents had been a victim of community violence (that is, gunshot or stabbing), and a control group of 30 children matched on variables of race, age, gender, and neighborhood served as the sample for this study. Parents completed a demographics sheet and the Child Behavior Checklist. Data were collected within six weeks of parental victimization. No significant difference was found in male and female youths' internalizing and externalizing behavior at ages six to eight. However, beginning at age nine there was a significant difference in behavior. Youths exposed to parental victimization internalized and externalized to a greater degree than those children who were not exposed. Males externalized more than females, and females internalized more than males. Thus, the perceived trauma response may vary as a function of the child's gender and developmental level or age.

A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program may offer relief to these caregivers by providing tools for self-care and heath promotion that otherwise may be lacking.METHODS: MBSR classes were offered without restriction to parents of children attending various clinics at a large urban children's medical centre. Caregivers completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Symptoms of Stress Inventory (SOSI) both before and after program participation.RESULTS: Forty-four caregivers participated in one of seven group MBSR sessions that were offered between August 2001 and February 2004. Most were mothers of children with special needs and various chronic conditions, who had been diagnosed an average of 7 years previous. Prior to the intervention, caregivers reported very high levels of stress and mood disturbance. These decreased substantially over the 8-week program, with an overall reduction in stress symptoms of 32% (p &lt; .001), and in total mood disturbance of 56% (p &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS: This brief MBSR program for caregivers of chronically ill children was successful in significantly decreasing substantial stress symptoms and mood disturbance.

Despite the fact that this issue has been extensively researched, patient nonadherence is still not well understood. Previous studies have tended to neglect the study of phenomenological perceptions and psychosocial influences on nonadherence behavior as well as issues unique to culturally diverse populations. This author used an interpretive approach to examine the cognitive and phenomenological dimensions of how Mexican-American women receiving dialysis treatment experience their illness (n = 26). Poverty, longer treatment history, immigrant status, perceived identity losses, and family dysfunction emerged as factors that influenced treatment nonadherence among this purposive sample.

Although the effects of the social work support services on stroke outcomes were modest, the study found that these services influenced stroke outcomes. Most importantly, the study revealed that higher levels of informational social work support services were associated with lower total hospital charges.",Social work support services for stroke patients: interventions and outcomes.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"With the advent of second-wave feminism during the 1970s, a significant body of literature emerged describing sexist practices in women's health care. Gender-bias and gender disparities found in women's health care became concerns that garnered considerable attention in the United States because of the increased health risks posed for women.

The participants (N = 357) in the study were recruited from the RAFIKI Foundation Clinic, a free primary healthcare clinic in Kibera, Nairobi's largest slum. Quantitative surveys were administered to all the participants regarding their adherence patterns and to a subgroup of mothers (N = 233) regarding their adherence in giving medicine to their children. 40 participated in four focus groups. 52% of participants reported taking all of their prescribed medication and 47% took it until they felt better. Over 65% of mothers reported giving all prescribed medication to their children. The most frequently cited barriers to adherence included lack of food and clean water, stress, and financial problems. By identifying obstacles to adherence and strategies to overcome them, this study showed that a community- based clinic with committed healthcare workers in Kenya can empower an economically disadvantaged population to be adherent.",The STARK study: a cross-sectional study of adherence to short-term drug regiments in urban Kenya.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Over the past ten years, the advances that have turned HIV into a chronic illness have also highlighted the importance of integrating prevention and care in the fight against the epidemic. This integration involves not only the creation of new programs, but also a reexamination of the process through which services and supports are provided. In this article, HIV partner notification is used as a case example; the discussion includes: the shifting time frame within which partner notification occurs; the expanding role of HIV-positive individuals in effecting both disease management and prevention goals; the connection between partner-notification and behaviorally-based risk reduction; and the ethical implications of advances on the partner notification process. The authors argue that partner notification services must be located in the context of overall treatment for infected individuals, and demonstrate how a redefinition of the partner notification process can serve as a spring-board for ongoing prevention counseling and support.",HIV-infected individuals as partners in prevention: a redefinition of the partner notification process.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper analyzes data collected through focus groups of patients at an outpatient AIDS clinic at a New York medical center. Seven focus groups were conducted with 42 HIV+ patients, and verbatim transcripts of focus group sessions were analyzed through a combination of ethnographic and content analysis. We examined patients' reports of interactions with and attitudes toward their providers and attempted to define what elements in the provider-patient relationship are necessary to enable patients to become more integrally involved in the management of their illness. Participants' statements emerged as consistent with three themes: (a) dynamics of provider-to-patient communication; (b) dynamics of patient-to-provider communication; and (c) dynamics of collaboration. Each of these themes is discussed in terms of its implications for creating patient-provider relationships based on mutual-participation, and requisites for effecting meaningful patient-provider partnerships are outlined.","Patient-provider relationships, HIV, and adherence: requisites for a partnership.",2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Providers working with children living with HIV strive to achieve &quot;good adherence,&quot; often viewed only as consistent pill taking by the infected child. This goal, while important, needs to be expanded with a thorough examination of the many biopsychosocial factors impacting the HIV affected family. The complexity of the issues affecting adherence to a pediatric HIV medical regimen can overwhelm both the practitioner and the patient. By utilizing a developmental framework and emphasizing the critical importance of the relationship between provider, patient and family, the authors (both of whom are social workers who have worked over a period of many years with children and families living with terminal and serious chronic illnesses) describe a developmental approach that includes comprehensive assessment to address the multiple challenges faced by individuals and families they have worked with.",Pediatric HIV adherence: an ever-evolving challenge.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Understanding and enhancing adherence to HIV medications has been identified as a major challenge. The purpose of this study was to explore patterns and determinants of non-adherence among individuals receiving HIV care in a medical clinic. Seven focus groups were conducted with 42 HIV+ patients, and verbatim transcripts of focus group sessions were analyzed through a combination of ethnographic and content analysis. Of the participants currently on combination therapy, 68% reported at least one recent instance of non-adherence. The most commonly cited reasons for non-adherent behavior were grouped into four categories: (1) problems with side effects; (2) conflicts with daily life activities; (3) feelings of aversion toward the medications themselves; and (4) deliberate alterations to the prescribed regimen. Findings based on structured analysis of patient responses in each category differ from past research which defines adherence as a treatment problem and emphasizes logistical characteristics of the treatment regimen itself and patients' ability or willingness to follow specific instructions. In contrast, our focus group data suggest an alternative frame for understanding barriers to adherence which focuses on: (1) the meaning that adherence/pill-taking behavior has for individuals experiencing chronic illness; and (2) the impact that this behavior has on their identity. Because adherence behavior is integral to patients' experience of their disease, non-adherence is no longer a treatment problem, but is an illness problem. Framing adherence as an illness problem rather than a treatment problem is a critical shift that can be applied to the creation of assessments and interventions designed to support patient adherence; this article ends with a series of specific recommendations for programs, policy, and research.",Reframing HIV adherence as part of the experience of illness.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"There is a tendency in health care to treat clients' maladies in accordance with two basic premises: (1) the medical needs of the client (as perceived by the clinician) can be successfully addressed by focusing solely on that aspect of the client's life and (2) if the client is not able or ready, then there will be someone in the client's support system to take responsibility for administering prescribed therapy. In many cases these assumptions hold true, but for certain sub-populations they do not, notably: individuals with substandard/chaotic lives, those with multiple confounding diagnoses (mental health, substance abuse, disability, addiction, domestic violence) who have neither personal adherence ability nor adequate support systems. They are rarely seen in ambulatory care settings, engaging with the health care system only through emergency rooms and hospital admissions. Such a group makes up a large proportion of urban, HIV positive clients. For them, successful adherence can only be accomplished by rethinking what constitutes 'care' and 'tailoring' that care to the individual. In this context adherence requires the interweaving of three sets of needs: (1) needs perceived by the client, (2) client needs as observed by an objective recorder and assessed for impact on the client's ability and willingness to be adherent and (3) medical needs identified by a clinician. Extensive work with this population has led to the creation of a Cluster of Tools (HIVCOT), designed to quantitatively assess the severity of the varied needs (Health Importance Level or HIL), the adherence ability of the client (Adherence Functional Level or AFL) and how difficult it is to adhere to a given treatment (Level of Adherence Difficulty or LAD). Through the application of these tools it becomes possible for the medical providers to make individual adjustments to the design of care so that it closely fits the needs and abilities of the client. In this way the likelihood of adherence is maximized.",Shaping garments of care: tools for maximizing adherence potential.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper examines adherence to AIDS treatment, focusing on the challenges posed by rapidly changing treatment protocols. We examine the evolving views of treatment adherence, and endorse the &quot;concordance&quot; approach. This emphasizes collaboration and negotiation between provider and patient to formulate and maintain a manageable treatment regimen tailored to what the patient is ready, willing, and able to tolerate. Given the extreme rapidity with which treatment guidelines are revised or even reversed, the persistent uncertainty surrounding treatment risks and benefits, and the great variability in individuals' ability to tolerate a given regimen, we propose the term &quot;flexible rigidity&quot; to describe the type of adherence best suited to AIDS treatment. We present an organizational approach to supporting the type of provider-patient relationships needed to improve treatment adherence that features treatment- readiness assessment and custom-tailoring of treatment for those at all stages of the treatment-readiness continuum. We note that this model could be applied as well to prevention and management of other chronic diseases.",Flexible rigidity: supporting HIV treatment adherence in a rapidly-changing treatment environment.,2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This article discusses the shifting locus of control over risk-reduction and examines its implications for the care and support of HIV-positive individuals.

Second, we discuss the current state of risk assessment and intervention as it relates to three factors: (a) the point along the continuum of risk at which risk assessment and intervention occurs; (b) the locus of control over risk reduction; and (c) the distinction between primary and secondary risk reduction efforts.

The primary goal has been to improve sociomedical HIV/AIDS services for a hard-to-reach inner city population. The current paper first summarizes the main advantages (e.g., greater efficiency; more realistic, effective programs with greater credibility among the community; stimulation of knowledge production and dissemination amongst players rarely formally engaged in such activities; creation of a platform useful for other applications) of this work. It then examines some of the main organizational challenges in conducting the work (involving issues such as personnel, coordination, funding, turf conflicts, sustainability). From this discussion emerge organizational requisites to conducting this work (e.g., development of key boundary-spanning figures; attention to the specific interests of potential linkage partners; translation efforts to demonstrate the value of participation; a continuous quality improvement approach featuring wide distribution of feedback in user-friendly form; flexibility, tact and patience), so that others can adapt and apply the linkage approach to manage HIV/AIDS or other problems.

A by-product of this work has been the development, elaboration and refinement of an approach to Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) which is appropriate for diverse community-based providers and agencies. A key component of our CQI system involves the installation of a sophisticated relational database management and reporting system (DBMS) which is used to collect, analyze, and report data in an iterative process to provide feedback among the evaluators, agency administration and staff. The database system is designed for two purposes: (1) to support the agency's administrative internal and external reporting requirements; (2) to support the development of practice driven health services and early intervention research.

This program is designed to understand, build, revise, and maintain the organizational infrastructure with which to link diverse players and sites, and combine these into a web for producing, assessing, and exchanging the information needed to combat HIV/AIDS. Each example demonstrates how opportunities were exploited for developing and linking resources within and between systems of care and prevention. The program began as an iterative and systems approach to improve access of high-risk, hard-to-reach inner city New York populations to HIV/AIDS services, treatment, and research. The approach is also currently being further elaborated and applied in Argentina and India (see Boylan et al., this volume), and is adaptable to other local and global public health challenges (see Indyk &amp; Rier, this volume).","Wiring the HIV/AIDS system: building interorganizational infrastructure to link people, sites, and networks.",2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper presents the rationale for a long-running project in which various community-based and tertiary-based providers are being linked to each other in order to understand, reach, and engage high-risk, hard-to-reach inner-city residents for prevention, treatment, and management of HIV/AIDS. Not simply a program to link disparate actors, the work has developed into a more fundamental approach through which to build and maintain the infrastructure required to generate and sustain knowledge development and integration within and between systems. This work is grounded in the recognition that each type of provider, as well as patients and clients themselves, has a particular type of expertise. All forms of expertise are necessary to fight HIV/ AIDS. Different forms of expertise are necessary to diagnose, treat, prevent, and cure HIV/AIDS and its sequelae. This work suggests revisions in traditional approaches to expertise and to the content and geometry of dissemination networks, and ultimately challenges the very concepts of dissemination and the lay/scientific boundary.","The rationale of interorganizational linkages to connect multiple sites of expertise, knowledge production, and knowledge transfer: an example from HIV/AIDS services for the inner city.",2006,United States,Soc Work Health Care,An innovative community-based intervention for African American women with breast cancer: the Witness Project.,2006,United States,Health Soc Work,Saving Grace: a breast cancer prevention program in the African American community.,2006,United States,Health Soc Work,Ensuring equal access for Medicaid children.,2006,United States,Health Soc Work"This study examines a case management intervention for first-time pregnant and parenting adolescents.

Using birth certificate data, logistic regression and survival analyses were used to compare prenatal care use, birth outcomes, and subsequent births, adjusting for age, race, marital status, and tobacco use during pregnancy. The groups had similar rates of prenatal care use. Participation in APP, however, was associated with an increased likelihood of normal birthweight (more than 2,500 grams [5.5 pounds]) and full-term birth (at or more than 37 weeks).

The disease is referred to as the &quot;silent thief,&quot; because it is often not until a person falls and breaks a bone that patients and their physicians become aware of weakening bones. An estimated 1.5 million bone fractures occur each year in the United States and cost nearly dollar 17 billion in health care costs and lost productivity. The perception that osteoporosis is an older person's disease is an erroneous one. Osteoporosis does not discriminate by age; in fact, it is a geriatric disease with an adolescent onset.

There are modifiable and non-modifiable stroke risks and proper management of some of these risks could significantly reduce the risk of stroke incidence. However, proper management of stroke risks requires public awareness of these risks and awareness of appropriate approaches to managing them. In case of stroke incidence, it is also important for patients to be able to recognize stroke symptoms and get immediate emergency medical attention. In this article, stroke awareness is studied as awareness of stroke warning signs, proper management of stroke risks, and awareness of what to do in case of stroke. The article analyzes mail questionnaire responses from 1,114 West Virginia residents. Respondents were mostly not properly managing stroke risks such as diabetes and hypertension. There was also a lack of awareness of severe stroke symptoms such as loss of vision in one eye and sudden severe headache.

Even though more than half of all strokes are preventable, the incidence has increased in recent years and remains the leading cause of adult disability. Age is highly associated with stroke and twice as likely to occur with each decade after age 55. Risks fall into one of two categories. One category, such as obesity and high blood pressure, are controllable through behavior change and/or preventive medical care. The other category of risks, such as age or race, are not controllable. Stroke risks tend to occur in multiples that interact to heighten individual effects, thus, interdisciplinary methods to identify and reduce risk may be required. Social workers can play a key role in these partnerships.

Clinical social work implications are examined.",Grief reactions and depression in caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease: results from a pilot study in an urban setting.,2005,United States,Health Soc Work"Although social work participation on interdisciplinary teams is long-standing, little research has been done to examine its effectiveness. This study used the Index of Interdisciplinary Collaboration to explore relationships between selected variables and teamwork in the hospice setting. The findings indicate that hospice social workers report a high level of interdisciplinary collaboration with colleagues. Whereas education, hospice census, the presence of other social workers, and quality of care were found to be unrelated to overall levels of collaboration, individual items measuring collaboration proved to be linked with hospice census, the presence of other social workers on the team, and quality of care. Further research is required to investigate other possible related variables and their impact on successful interdisciplinary collaboration and service delivery.",Examining variables related to successful collaboration on the hospice team.,2005,United States,Health Soc Work"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to examine the practice validity of a new ecological assessment instrument for 3(rd) through 5(th) graders in terms of whether it provided school staff with new knowledge about students. METHOD: Pre-assessment knowledge of school staff was compared to data obtained from 21 children and their parents on 29 measures. Data were collected using the Elementary School Success Profile (ESSP). School staff pre-assessment knowledge was compared to obtained data across seven domains of children's lives (neighborhood, school, family, peers, parent educational involvement, well-being, and home behavior), data sources (child and parent), and grade level of students. RESULTS: Pre-assessment knowledge was not highly correlated with obtained data; pre-assessment expectations matched obtained data only about 41% of the time; and knowledge varied by domain, source, and grade level. CONCLUSIONS: Ecological assessments can address gaps in school staff's knowledge of targetable factors that influence the success of students.",KNOWLEDGE GAPS AMONG SCHOOL STAFF AND THE ROLE OF HIGH QUALITY ECOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS IN SCHOOLS.,2005,United States,Res Soc Work Pract"The social work profession has a long history of advocacy to improve the human condition, especially for groups of people at high risk of discrimination and marginalization. Social workers have been instrumental in identifying, assessing, treating, and preventing illicit drug use as part of this commitment to advocacy. One component of social work's endeavors on behalf of drug users and other populations- at-risk has been advocating for increased access to health care. This article examines the role that having health insurance plays in obtaining the most basic of all health care-getting a physical examination. Featuring a sample of 1,271 chronic and injecting street drug users and comparison group non-users, the analysis demonstrates that having health insurance enhances access and utilization of health care among this at-risk population. Subjects who had health insurance for even one month of the past twelve were twice as likely to participate in basic health care by having a physical exam.",Back to basics: the role of health insurance in getting a physical exam.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Breast cancer is a life event experienced by many women and is one that impacts various aspects of a woman's life including her occupational and family roles. A social worker is often an important part of a woman's health care team following a breast cancer diagnosis as well as throughout treatment, providing assistance in helping women to cope with negative social psychological effects associated with the illness experience. The purpose of this article is to provide social workers with an opportunity to consider the utilization of empirically established interventions such as social support from the relatively unknown field of leisure science. Through semi-structured interviews with eight women, the role and meaning of leisure and social support in the lives of women with breast cancer were explored. The findings indicated these women experienced and perceived social support through leisure activities with friends and family during and following treatment and also through their volunteer work following treatment. The research can help social workers understand the potential role of leisure interventions in meeting the needs of women with breast cancer throughout their illness experience. Implications for social work education are also highlighted.",Overlooked and underutilized: the critical role of leisure interventions in facilitating social support throughout breast cancer treatment and recovery.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The purpose of this study is to identify challenges to continual use of adult day services. Individuals who stayed in five adult day health care programs for four weeks or less are compared to those who stayed enrolled more than four weeks. Data were gathered from new intake files recorded January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2000 at five adult day programs operating in central Ohio. This study is based on 143 clients who disenrolled during this study period. Short stay participants were significantly different from long stay participants in race, educational level, mental health, and in financial and social resources.

However, some of the literature as well as the findings of this study, point to competent case management as being contingent on interventions that successfully address key psychosocial problems. This paper presents a qualitative study involving experienced geriatric care managers. Psychosocial problem and intervention categories are identified as well as overarching themes with significant implications for practice. The paper argues that a grounded, thorough, well-explicated and generalizable model for clinically-focused geriatric case management practice is necessary; it also suggests additional research towards the development of such a model.",Toward understanding the clinical aspects of geriatric case management.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"For the most part, social casework literature is based on the assumption that social workers have on-going contacts with clients over a period of time. However, the experience of social workers in a number of fields of practice suggests that it is common for social workers to see clients only once. This paper reports on a qualitative study of hospital social workers' experiences of single session contacts with clients. Analysis of the data from focus groups with hospital social workers indicated that they do not always give single session work the significance it deserves, although a high level of skill is seen to be required to do such brief work well. A number of distinctive characteristics of single session work were identified including setting clear goals and parameters, establishing rapport quickly and adhering to the social work principle of self determination at the same time as working quite directively. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.",NA,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Our purpose was to discuss the need for measuring and documenting social work services, as well as to discuss the data and statistical collection method used in Mayo Clinic's Section of Medical Social Services, which may be useful to other social service departments.

Veteran Israelis were twice as likely to have been in contact with a hospital social worker. Factors related to seeing a social worker were male gender, social network size (no network or large network), activity limitations, and sick days.

Survey data collected from a random sample of 853 women in rural North Carolina were used to explore the impact of psychosocial factors, including cultural beliefs, on differences by race and age in behavioral intentions if a breast lump was found. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age and past mammography screening predicted the intention to get a mammogram, whereas physician communication about breast cancer risk, never having a mammogram, breast cancer worry, and religious beliefs about God's role in curing cancer influenced women's intentions to watch the lump for changes. Factors in both models did not account for racial differences.

More participants who reported recent UAI endorsed avoidance strategies than did those who did not report UAI. There was a positive relationship between avoidance coping scores and odds for reported UAI. Among the study's implications was the importance of the larger context in which prevention efforts with this population occur, one that is marked by stigmatization, discrimination, loneliness, and other stresses.

Self-esteem and perceived health were associated with stress at the study baseline, importance of a biological family and extent of spousal support associated with stress at the 12-month follow-up, and factors pertaining to infertility treatment (number of treatments, relationship with physicians) associated with stress at the 24-month follow-up. Self-esteem was the only psychosocial factor associated with change in stress over the course of treatment.

The research sample included 60 Israeli women with breast cancer, who responded to questionnaires at two stages of their illness: the stage of initial discovery (after first learning of the illness) and approximately six months later (the stage of mitigation and accommodation). The overall level of adjustment to the illness was moderate. While the patients adjusted relatively well in the family and domestic environments, their adjustment in the dimensions of health care, psychological distress, and sexual relations was relatively low. The most frequent causal attributions were psychological factors and family history of illness. The patients' subjective state of health, sense of coherence, and levels of social support were related to most of the adjustment dimensions examined, although both internal and external causal attributions correlated negatively with adjustment in every dimension.",Adjustment to breast cancer: the contribution of resources and causal attributions regarding the illness.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study explored the life-world of individuals being treated for end stage renal disease with a home haemodialysis machine (HHDM). A phenomenological framework was employed to gain an understanding of the lived-body in relation to the HHDM in order to assist in the planning of future social work interventions. A purposive sample of three participants who had each experienced various lengths of HHDT, were interviewed using two semi-structured in-depth interviews, one week apart. Interviews were conducted at a place of the participant's choice. Participants were asked to speak about their experience of HHDT and how it related to their bodily experience. The findings were interpreted using interpretive phenomenological analytic methods. The central theme that arose from the data was &quot;Struggles between the body and machine&quot;. This theme spoke to paradoxical dilemma of living with a life saving machine that you have no control over. Implications suggest that the machine's tendency to be personified, means that it be considered as family member in social assessment. Emotional support to patients should acknowledge the machines dehumanizing tendencies and as well as the issue of its personification.

Hospital staff (N=94) responded to the survey with a 100% return rate. Responses identified situations considered to be stressful, and described how healthcare providers in this setting dealt with these incidents.

Respondents (674 Chinese adults from Hong Kong) completed the BMSWBI via the Internet. Results indicate that all four scales have high reliability, with alpha coefficients ranging from .87 to .92, and concurrent validity. Factor analysis indicates that (a) positive and negative affect form two distinct factors; and (b) spirituality comprises three distinct aspects, tranquility, resistance to disorientation, and resilience. Spirituality is positively associated with mental well-being, positive affect, satisfaction with life, and hope; but negatively associated with negative affect and perceived stress.

Groups consisted of dyads of older people and their potential or designated health care agents randomly assigned to the intervention (STEP program) or control group. STEP participants received three group sessions with educational and support components. For individual participants, there was a statistically significant difference between groups on knowledge of the health care proxy form and the roles and responsibilities of the agent. For the dyads of older people and their agents, there was a significantly higher mean communication score for the STEP participants than for the control group.

The sample consisted of 393 psychiatric consumers recruited from 25 psychosocial rehabilitation services (PSR) agencies. Key findings were that affective (that is, negative and positive affect) and cognitive (that is, beliefs in devaluation-discrimination) traits influence self-esteem and behavioral coping, and significant effects of affective and cognitive traits on behavioral coping are mediated by self-esteem. The findings suggest that interventions targeting self-esteem could be effective in modifying the behavioral coping of consumers served in PSR agencies.

Twenty-five hospital social workers participated in the study. The three dimensions of burnout, namely emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment, changed between the pre-training and post-training measures: personal accomplishment rose by 12.39% and depersonalization fell by 29.75%. The difference was significant for the two dimensions in both groups. Emotional exhaustion significantly declined in the hospital social-work skills group only, and revealed a group-time effect. The level of peer support rose in the hospital-skills group and was positively related to a lowering of emotional exhaustion. This was an exploratory study, with a rather small sample, and the results are preliminary, but they show a promising possibility of burnout reduction among professional workers. Further research on the effect of skill development training on reducing burnout is needed.",Can skill-development training alleviate burnout in hospital social workers?.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The biopsychosocial model was used to analyze data from an open-ended item in a survey of individuals following kidney transplantation. After sending surveys to kidney transplant recipients at a large, Midwestern teaching hospital, this work analyzed the themes that emerged from an inquiry into factors that affected their ability to return to work or switch jobs. The results revealed that concerns reflecting biological/ psychological factors were most frequently indicated followed by social concerns. That is, the majority of the responses were related to a physical disorder or condition (biological) that appeared to have been directly related to a psychological response to it. This was followed by social concerns primarily related to health insurance. Thus, the researchers involved in this study conclude that social workers in health care must: (1) consistently embrace the assumptions of the biopsychosocial model so that the most inclusive assessments and interventions can be rendered, while (2) remaining knowledgeable regarding legislative changes that impact health insurance coverage for this specific population.",Barriers to employment following renal transplantation: implications for the social work professional.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this exploratory analysis was to assess the prevalence of caregiving among older (60+) newly diagnosed female breast cancer patients and to examine the risk of depression associated with breast cancer, caregiving, and age, at 3 months and 12 months after diagnosis.METHODS: Data from interviews conducted for the case-control study, Health and Functioning in Women with Breast Cancer (HFW), were used for this analysis. Interviews were conducted at 3 months and 12 months post-diagnosis. Participants for this analysis were restricted to those who completed both interviews (cases n = 904; controls n = 966). Risk of depression was assessed using a self-reported depression question from the HFW instrument.RESULTS: The multivariate analysis showed that stage of breast cancer was significantly related to depression among older women with breast cancer while controlling for various socio-demographic factors; however, caregiving did not significantly increase the risk for depression for this population.DISCUSSION: A breast cancer diagnosis for women, regardless of age or caregiving status, presented an increased risk of depression at 3 and 12 months post-diagnosis.

Social work's role in this teaching hospital setting was tailored to provide patients and medical staff access to social work services upon admission, rather than at the time of discharge. This change places social work at the pivotal juncture to improve medical care and addresses the social, cultural and environmental concerns as they surface during patient stay. Unique to this demonstration model is the added advantage of placing the social worker at the hub of the physician-led medical team. Medical students, residents, and attending physicians all learn, observe, and experience the advantages social workers bring to the process. Educating medical students on teams with social workers bodes well for the profession.

As with Medicare's hospital reimbursement system, home health agencies have to provide appropriate and adequate care for a flat rate reimbursement for each patient. As a result coordination and collaboration among all members of the home health care team (that is, nurses, social workers, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, and home health aides) is critical to provide home care for frail and chronically ill populations.

However, the validity of many PBAs for use with cultural minority groups is limited. To ensure that cultural minority groups are not misrepresented by standardized measures, social workers--as effective patient advocates--must be familiar with the underlying conceptual assumptions of measurement theory to articulate the strengths and limitations of measures used to investigate populations with which they have not been tested and advocate for cultural minority groups using language and terminology that measurement practitioners can understand and embrace.",Assessment and the ubiquity of culture: threats to validity in measures of health-related quality of life.,2005,United States,Health Soc Work"HIV/AIDS, suicide, violence, and barriers to health care access among transgender people were explored using two needs assessment surveys conducted in Philadelphia in 1997. A total of 182 people responded to a face-to-face interview or self-administered mail survey: 113 male-to-female individuals and 69 female-to-male individuals. About three-fifths of respondents had engaged in unprotected sexual activity during the past 12 months. The risk for HIV infection from unprotected sex was significantly higher among respondents of color than among white respondents. About one-third (30.1 percent) of respondents had attempted suicide. More than half of respondents had been forced to have sex, 56.3 percent had experienced violence in their homes, and 51.3 percent had been physically abused. Twenty-six percent of respondents had been denied medical care because they were transgender. These findings suggest that prevention services that specifically address HIV/AIDS, suicide, and violence among transgender people are urgently needed.",Transgender health: findings from two needs assessment studies in Philadelphia.,2005,United States,Health Soc Work"This article examines health insurance stability patterns and the factors associated with stable coverage in a sample of 453 low-income working women. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the authors found that only 51 percent of these women had stable coverage during 1995-1997. Logistic regression results indicate that, controlling for other factors, health insurance stability is significantly higher for those who have higher levels of welfare receipt, have more work hours, have fewer job changes, have higher education levels, are African American or Hispanic, and who live outside central cities. The findings suggest that point-in-time health coverage estimates substantially underestimate the health coverage problems of low-income working women. Health policies need to be more sensitive to transitional problems resulting from job changes, marital disruptions, and other changes in circumstances. Recommendations for revising health care policies and for improving existing health care programs are presented.",Stability of health care coverage among low-income working women.,2005,United States,Health Soc Work,The uninsured: a forgotten population.,2005,United States,Health Soc WorkThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relationship of required educational background of APS workers to the 1999 rates of domestic elder abuse. Data were obtained from APS related statutes and regulations and questions to the National Center for Elder Abuse list serve. Descriptive statistics and independent sample t-tests were used for analyses. Those states whose legislations required a social work degree for APS caseworkers did have higher elder abuse investigation rates. A lower substantiation ratio was found for those states requiring a social work degree or license. These findings suggest that social work education may lead to an emphasis on investigation and interventions and de-emphasis on the criminal aspects of elder abuse evaluation substantiations.,APS workers job requirements associated with elder abuse rates.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Glaucoma, an eye disorder that gradually decreases peripheral vision, affects millions of older adults. Consequences of glaucoma can mean changes in the ability to perform familiar tasks, including driving an automobile. We surveyed older drivers with glaucoma and a control comparison group in order to learn more about their driving habits and expectations about driving cessation. Findings indicate that compared to the control group, drivers with glaucoma are significantly more likely to change their driving habits with regard to driving at night (p=0.003), on freeways (p=0.05), and in unfamiliar areas (p=0.01). Drivers with glaucoma were also significantly more likely to report family concern about their driving (p=0.01). However, the drivers with glaucoma did not anticipate that their disease would force them to discontinue driving.

This study examined both the caregiver strains and gains in a diverse urban sample of 85 caregivers (spouses and adult children). Eighty-one percent of the caregivers reported both strains and gains, while 19% of the caregivers reported only experiencing strains. The caregiver strains originated from worries and uncertainties, balancing multiple demands, and feeling overwhelmed with care, while spiritual growth, personal growth, and feelings of mastery produced feelings of gain.

The sample consisted of physicians (n=32), nurses (n=74), and social workers (n=29). The research surveyed advance directive communication practices by discipline utilizing a self-administered questionnaire. Advance directive communication was operationalized as a cumulative process incorporating the following phases that were measured as scales: initiation of the topic, disclosure of information, identification of a surrogate decision-maker, discussion of treatment options, elicitation of patient values, interaction with family members, and collaboration with other health care professionals. Results suggest that social workers offer distinct skills in their advance directive communication practices and discuss advance directives more frequently than either physicians or nurses.",Advance directive communications practices:social worker's contributions to the interdisciplinary health care team.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Past research on senior centers has mainly focused on utilization, frequency, duration of attendance, participation or various activities and services. This study strives to go beyond previous research by examining social support factors and their relationship to mental and physical health across a senior center population in southern Ontario, Canada. Data were collected at two large senior centers in the Kitchener, Waterloo area. We used a self-administered survey among a sample of older participants (n=186). One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Duncan's multiple range tests, t-tests, and linear regression analyses were used to examine the influence of social support (friendship, caregiving and advice) on mental and physical health. The results indicated that caregiving is significantly related to physical health, how respondents feel in general, and happiness with personal life. Advice from others is significantly related to perceptions of having a life full of interesting things. Additionally, respondents who are volunteers perceive better health and social support than non-volunteers, those who eat at the center perceive better health and caregiving support, and those that started a new activity perceived better health and social support from friendships. Implications for social work practice, policy and future research are discussed.","Social support factors and health among a senior center population in southern Ontario, Canada.",2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Hospitals present a variety of complex challenges for social work practitioners. Clinical social workers deal with emotionally intense and potentially draining cases in a setting where they are often faced with threats to their identity or existence.

This exploratory descriptive cross-sectional study employed a brief self-report survey in a clinic waiting area. Logistic regression was used to understand the influence of age, gender and income on the existence of specific concerns. Results indicate that caregiving, finances and health are issues for 1/3 of the participants and that 44% endorsed 2 or more concerns.

No one is known to have recovered from HIV infection. There is no vaccine to cure AIDS (Population Reports, 1989 and The Hindu, dated 9.3.2000). Until a cure or vaccine for HIV infection is found, the only way to prevent the spread of the disease is by changing people's behaviour through AIDS education programmes (Population Reports, 1986). Many national governments are using broadcast, print media, personal contact, counselling methods, etc., to educate people on AIDS and safer sex. Thus, the best vaccine is the 'Social Vaccine.' Social vaccine involves spreading education on how to protect oneself, hundred percent condom use, and changing sexual behaviour. In fact, the social vaccine was so successful in Thailand that the infection rate has come down by 50 per cent (The Hindu, dated 9.3.2000). Truck drivers, prostitutes, and young adults are considered high risk groups for HIV/AIDS in India. An action research study was conducted in Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh (India) among truck drivers. As part of this study, different strategies, namely mass media, personal contact, group discussion, folk media, and counselling, were adopted to provide AIDS education, to encourage increase in condom use for safer sex, and bring changes in their sexual behaviour. The strategies adopted in this study greatly enhanced the knowledge of the truck drivers on AIDS, changed their attitudes on sex, increased the use of condoms, and modified their sexual behaviour. Thus, the social vaccine would help spread education on AIDS, bring changes in the sexual behaviour of the people, increase condom use, and thus help to prevent the AIDS scourge throughout the world.

The former utilises the language of citizen empowerment and rights, whilst the latter is concerned with reducing welfare dependency through labour market activation. A central question here is whether a suitable programme of therapeutic work, training and support will produce better outcomes than those predicted by either a clinical diagnostic assessment or indeed open employment in the labour market. This article evaluates a research project with mental health users designed to develop pathways towards inclusion. The principal means for achieving this was a programme of 'green' land-based activities, training and social support. The researchers employed a mixed method approach, utilising a quasi-experimental design with a hypothetical control and standardised testing. This was followed by interviews with users, staff and focus group discussion. The evaluation produced some unexpected findings; for example, it was found that no strong correlation existed between diagnosis and performance. Many users performed better than had been predicted by their diagnostic assessment. However, the reasons for this remained unclear until the qualitative interviews enabled users to give accounts of the problems they faced, explain what inclusion meant for them, and outline how the project had brought gains in confidence, motivation and self belief. The data gathered during the research derived from different epistemological positions. This can be seen as representing two ways of 'slicing the reality cake' rather than producing one complete view of mental health users reality. One construction related to how 'the system' diagnosed, processed, and 'objectively' managed them. The other was about how users' responded to their situation, utilised the opportunities available, and made 'subjective' sense of their experience.","Mental health, social inclusion and the green agenda: an evaluation of a land based rehabilitation project designed to promote occupational access and inclusion of service users in North Somerset, UK.",2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Children and adolescents with emotional disorders may often be characterized by having problems in peer and adult relations and in display of inappropriate behaviours. These include suicide attempts, anger, withdrawal from family, social isolation from peers, aggression, school failure, running away, and alcohol and/or drug abuse. A lack of self-concept and self-esteem is often central to these difficulties. Traditional treatment methods with young people usually includes cognitive- behavioural approaches with psychotherapy. Unfortunately these children often lack a solid communication base, creating a block to successful treatment. In my private clinical practice, I have endeavoured to break through these communication barriers by using music as a therapy tool. This paper describes and discusses my use of music as a therapy tool with troubled adolescents. Pre- and post-testing of the effectiveness of this intervention technique by using the Psychosocial Functioning Inventory for Primary School Children (PFI-PSC) has yielded positive initial results, lending support to its continued use. Music has often been successful in helping these adolescents engage in the therapeutic process with minimised resistance as they relate to the music and the therapist becomes a safe and trusted adult.

This paper seeks to explore how this may eventually be realised in new working relationships that will profoundly affect mental health social work. These changes are driven by factors that are external to the social work profession-in policy initiatives that introduce measures of performance that incorporate the service user in both evaluating and planning services, in efforts to build new relationships, and in a breakdown of barriers between social work practitioners and service managers. While these changes are sometimes likely to be resisted by practitioners and service users alike, the demands of policy makers for a new professional accountability to service users can be used to pave the way for effective dialogue. The paper outlines the steps necessary to build confidence among both service users and service providers. This requires sensitive management and leadership. It also requires that action demonstrably follows from such dialogue. The paper uses evidence from Community Mental Health Teams in Swansea, over a three-year period, to demonstrate how the policy and management imperatives faced by service providers can be reconciled with the expressed desires of mental health service users.",Changing practice: involving mental health service users in planning service provision.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Mental illness is an issue for a number of families reported to child protection agencies. Parents with mental health problems are more vulnerable, as are their children, to having parenting and child welfare concerns. A recent study undertaken in the Melbourne Children's Court (Victoria, Australia) found that the children of parents with mental health problems comprised just under thirty percent of all new child protection applications brought to the Court and referred to alternative dispute resolution, during the first half of 1998. This paper reports on the study findings, which are drawn from a descriptive survey of 228 Pre-Hearing Conferences. A data collection schedule was completed for each case, gathering information about the child welfare concerns, the parents' problems, including mental health problems, and the contribution by mental health professionals to resolving child welfare concerns. The study found that the lack of involvement by mental health social workers in the child protection system meant the Children's Court was given little appreciation of either a child's emotional or a parent's mental health functioning. The lack of effective cooperation between the adult mental health and child protection services also meant decisions made about these children were made without full information about the needs and the likely outcomes for these children and their parents. This lack of interagency cooperation between mental health social work and child welfare also emerged in the findings of the Icarus project, a cross-national project, led by Brunel University, in England. This project compared the views and responses of mental health and child welfare social workers to the dependent children of mentally ill parents, when there were child protection concerns. It is proposed that adult mental health social workers involve themselves in the assessment of, and interventions in, child welfare cases when appropriate, and share essential information about their adult, parent clients.

The study is based on the interviews of six 9-11 years old children and narratives of seventeen female grown up children of mentally ill parents. The younger and older children of the mentally ill parents had not been informed about their parent's illness. The illness of the parent aroused a variety of emotions in them. The children used both practical problem solving and emotional coping mechanisms. Informal social support was available to them but seldom from the public services. It is recommended that professionals in mental health and child welfare services clarify their roles when working with mentally ill parents. The best interest of the child and the parenting they need should be carefully assessed. Open care measures should be offered to families early enough to prevent serious child welfare and mental problems.",Coping and resilience of children of a mentally ill parent.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, a study of 77 families was undertaken to examine the long-term psychosocial effects of cancer on children and their families. This paper focuses specifically on the findings in relation to the parents' subgroup of the overall study. Key findings were that the majority of parents and their children readjust to ordinary family life following completion of treatment. Gender differences in parents' coping mechanisms emerged. The period immediately following the cessation of treatment can create feelings of isolation and vulnerability, and many parents have ongoing worries about their child's continued well-being.",The long-term psychosocial effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment on children and their families.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Twenty-nine parents of children who had been diagnosed with cancer were interviewed through long and relatively unstructured interviews conducted via telephone by a mother whose own daughter once had cancer. Parents were asked to tell the story of their experiences during the time that they were 'going through' cancer. Parents usually began their narrative in the months, weeks, or days prior to the diagnosis. They spoke of various parts of the story. In this paper, the focus is on one topic that parents talked about a lot. We call this 'problems with the system' or 'surplus suffering.' Here parents reported on their perceptions of mistakes, and delays in diagnosis, errors, carelessness, and unkindness during treatment. They talked of how they felt they had to be on constant guard, and at times, to intervene in their child's care. This paper provides a picture of parental expectations and their violation during the treatment of their children for cancer. It begins to demonstrate how parents see themselves as advocates for their children in a context of fragile power relations.",Parents as advocates: stories of surplus suffering when a child is diagnosed and treated for cancer.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"In the Eastern European countries included in the communist system of the USSR, parents of disabled children were encouraged to commit their disabled child to institutional care. There were strict legal regulations excluding them from schools. Medical assessments were used for care decisions. Nevertheless many parents decided to care for their disabled child at home within the family. Ukraine became an independent country in 1991, when communism was replaced by liberal democracy within a free market system. Western solutions have been sought for many social problems existing, but 'hidden,' under the old regime. For more of the parents of disabled children, this has meant embracing ideas of caring for their disabled children in the community, and providing for their social, educational, and medical needs, which have previously been denied. The issue of disability is a serious one for Ukraine where the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 caused extensive radiation poisoning. This almost certainly led to an increase in the number of disabled children being born and an increase in the incidence of various forms of cancer. This paper is based on a series of observation visits to some of the many self-help groups established by parents, usually mothers, for their disabled children. It draws attention to the emotional stress experienced both by parents and their disabled children in the process of attempting to come to terms with the disabling conditions, and the denial of the normal rights of childhood resulting from prejudice, poor resources, ignorance, and restrictive legislation. Attempts have been made to identify the possible role and tasks of professional social workers within this context. International comparisons show that many parents and their children do not benefit from the medical model of disability, and that serious consequences include the development of depressive illness among those who find that little help is available from public services.",Disabled children and their families in Ukraine: health and mental health issues for families caring for their disabled child at home.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper reports the qualitative findings from 40 couples involved in a study exploring men's post-natal mental health. Interviews were conducted with individuals soon after the birth of their first child. Findings suggest that new fathers want to be more involved in the direct care and nurturing of their children than their fathers were with them. Discourses which construct fathers and inform social structures have not kept pace with men's changed attitudes and role expectations limiting the options available to men as fathers. In particular men's employment circumstances figure in their experience of adjusting to life as a father. Those fathers having least flexibility and autonomy in their work report experiencing, since the birth of their child, more unhappiness, anxiety, and generally higher levels of stress. These findings suggest increasing workplace flexibility and provisions such as parental leave are important for men's post-natal mental health.",Time to father.,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Started in 1993, in a small way, by a social worker as a response to the growing destitution of mentally ill women and with the objective of giving shelter, treatment and mainstreaming them, The Banyan has so far given 'Adaikalam' (refuge) to 413 women, of whom 252 have been rehabilitated. The entire care process starts from the time the women are picked from the streets in a disheveled and deranged state and brought to the home after much difficulty. On arrival they are spruced up and clinically assessed by a psychiatrist and put on medication. Slowly and steadily they return to the world of reality. Simultaneously, the inmates are put through various therapies like individual counseling, music, art, yoga, and vocational training. Finally, the address of the inmates is traced, and a team from The Banyan accompanies them, and they are rehabilitated. The family is enlightened about the illness, the woman's stay at The Banyan, need for continuous medication. The Banyan is a lifetime service provider of medicines, keeping track by regular follow up and above all a friend to whom they can seek any help at any time.

The present research aimed at studying the psychosocial problems encountered in living, post HIV infection, and the coping patterns adopted by HIV seropositive wives of men with HIV/AIDS. In the background of an exploratory research design, thirty (n = 30) HIV positive women, attending Counseling Clinics in Bangalore (South India), selected through purposive sampling, were assessed using an interview schedule and a standardized coping scale. Majority of the respondents were the primary caregivers for their infected spouse and/or children. Content analysis of the problems revealed increased financial difficulties; problems in child care and support; compromised help-seeking due to stigma; problems in sexual interactions and communication in their marital relationship; role strain in caregiving; gender discriminatory and inadequate care; and increased concerns about parenting efficacy, post HIV infection. Escape avoidance was the most preferred coping strategy adopted by them.

A total of 54 interviews were carried out with women who identified themselves as Muslim and Bangladeshi. Health and social care professionals were also interviewed. However, the focus of this paper is upon the ways in which women conceptualised their health and social care needs and concerns. Our findings indicate that individual characteristics serve to mediate the influence of gender and ethnicity on health, but for the women in our study, socio-economic status represents the most potent factor in adversely affecting their health status and access to health care.","Understanding the interconnections between ethnicity, gender, social class and health:experiences of minority ethnic women in britain.",2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Sponsored forums were hosted to obtain the opinions of invited professionals on how to create the ideal system for protecting dependent adults in Iowa.

Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, then unitized and codified for analysis.RESULTS: Interviewees reported 136 strategies, collapsed into 40 distinct coping methods. Race and gender differences first were observed in the frequency distributions of methods. Whites reported significantly more problem-focused methods than African-Americans. Males reported, overall, fewer methods, less emotion-focused, yet more problem-focused methods than females. Interviewees reporting emotion-focused methods were less likely to report problem-focused methods. Emotion-focused coping was associated with poorer self-assessed diabetic control; problem-focused coping was associated with better control.CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that adults with type 2 diabetes use a variety of coping methods, with their basic coping styles influenced by race and gender. This study also demonstrated the usefulness of the problem/emotion-focused dichotomy as a coping method classification system and how these basic styles correlate with interviewees' diabetic control. Lastly, findings emphasize the complexity and importance of psychosocial coping in diabetes and the need for greater attention by clinicians and researchers.",Coping with type 2 diabetes: do race and gender matter?,2005,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper is based on data collected from two different studies of parents (76 mothers and 14 fathers) whose children had been diagnosed with cancer. Although the goal of the first study, to describe parental experiences when their children have cancer, was different than the goal of the second study, to describe the home health care work done by parents whose children had cancer, the themes outlined here were reiterated from study to study. In both sets of data conflicts in the dynamics of power, authority and knowledge were pivotal to the dilemmas experienced by parents in their interactions with health care staff both during the time of diagnosis and later during the treatments when their children had cancer. The paper points to the significance of fundamental social processes such as power, authority and knowledge in understanding and ameliorating parental experiences when a child has cancer.",Whose power/authority/knowledge?

The authors use elements of Hasenfeld and Brock's Political Economy Model (1991) to explain this transformation in service delivery that was spearheaded by a VA social work leadership team. It is argued that three driving forces crucial to program implementation were present: technological certainty, economic stability, and concentration of power. Evidence of the implementation's impact includes creation of new homeless program beds, a reduction in use of medical/psychiatric beds, and a large number of formerly homeless veterans with housing and employment at program discharge.

Hospital readmission rates are high among elderly patients with CHF, and it is thought that use of informal and formal services may reduce hospital readmission during the post-acute period. Using proportional Cox regression analysis, the authors examined the independent and joint effects of post-acute informal and formal services on hospital readmission. No evidence of service impact was found. Rather, hospital readmission was associated with a longer length of CHF history and noncompliance with medication regimes.

A groupwork service using cognitive-behavioral and self-management techniques were integrated into health care services at a Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center to treat depression in a small group of patients. An interdisciplinary team that included health care and mental health providers from the Center and a social work researcher guided the endeavor. Principles of Intervention Research were applied in the development of the service and to evaluate its effectiveness. Among the findings were that study participants realized a decrease in depressive symptoms.,Integrating the health and mental health needs of the chronically ill: a group for individuals with depression and sickle cell disease.,2004,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study examines the utility of satisfaction questionnaires in gauging the effectiveness of social work services in a paediatric hospital setting. Participants completed an empowerment scale before seeing a social worker. Approximately four weeks later, participants completed the empowerment scale again, at which time they also completed a satisfaction questionnaire. The difference between the pre- and post-test empowerment scores was compared with the satisfaction scores, and the influence of some demographic and intervention variables was examined. The results indicated that there was no significant relationship between participants' reported level of satisfaction with the social work service provided and the change in participants' empowerment scores before and after intervention. Most demographic and intervention variables tested did not yield any significant associations with satisfaction or change in empowerment. However, it was found that those who received both counselling and practical assistance (rather than only one or the other) and those with a higher level of education were more likely to report an increase in their level of empowerment after receiving social work intervention. This study lends further support to the contention that satisfaction questionnaires alone may not provide reliable information with regard to the utility and effectiveness of paediatric hospital social work intervention.",Client satisfaction and empowerment through social work intervention.,2004,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The use of chart reviews to assess substance use one-year postpartum was examined in this pilot study by comparing interviews with chart reviews for 23 women assessed positive for risk during pregnancy. There was no indication that providers asked about alcohol use in 83 percent of the charts, drug use in 57 percent of the charts, and tobacco use in 26 percent of the charts. Few positive or negative matches between interviews and chart reviews were found because substance use was generally not noted. These findings underscore the need to interview women to obtain postpartum substance use information and suggest that providers may not adequately address this issue.",Using chart reviews to assess postpartum substance abuse.

Knowledge about anticipatory and preventive approaches with women who are at risk for abuse is scarce, limiting professionals' ability to respond fully and effectively to this problem. This paper describes a retrospective, practice-based research study of social work interventions in two hospital-based primary care practices. A total of 431 female patients completed a self-administered questionnaire developed for the early detection of IPV risk factors during routine health care visits. The study showed surprisingly high rates of multiple risk markers in an urban primary care population whose medical presentations ordinarily would not raise provider suspicion about abuse. Findings confirmed the willingness of primary care populations to freely partake in routine screening and support the value of early identification and intervention with populations at risk. Practice implications are discussed.",Screening risks for intimate partner violence and primary care settings: implications for future abuse.,2004,United States,Soc Work Health Care"OBJECTIVE: In the context of the importance of valid self-report measures to research and evidence-based practice in social work, an argument-based approach to validity is presented and the concept of developmental validity introduced. Cognitive development theories are applied to the self-report process of children and cognitive pretesting is reviewed as a methodology to advance the validity of self-report instruments for children. An application of cognitive pretesting is presented in the development of the Elementary School Success Profile. METHOD: Two phases of cognitive pretesting were completed to gather data about how children read, interpret and answer self-report items. RESULTS: Cognitive pretesting procedures identified validity problems with numerous items leading to modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive pretesting framed by an argument-based approach to validity holds significant potential to improve the developmental validity of child self-report instruments.",Cognitive Pretesting and the Developmental Validity of Child Self-Report Instruments: Theory and Applications.,2004,United States,Res Soc Work Pract,End-of-life care.,2004,United States,Health Soc Work,Improving our care at life's end: making a difference.,2004,United States,Health Soc Work"Ethical dilemmas are inherent in every health care setting. A sample of hospice social workers with no direct access to a hospice ethics committee (N = 110) was surveyed regarding ethical issues in hospice care, how the issues were managed, and the extent to which social workers participated in resolution of ethical dilemmas. Common issues discussed were the patients' medical condition, involvement of family, and family denial of terminal illness. Difficult cases were discussed most often in interdisciplinary team meetings. Social workers were most involved in traditional social work activities, such as providing knowledge of community resources and patients' psychosocial histories and promoting self-determination in policies.",Social workers' participation in the resolution of ethical dilemmas in hospice care.,2004,United States,Health Soc Work"More than one-half of the 2.4 million deaths that will occur in the United States in 2004 will be immediately preceded by a time in which the likelihood of dying can best be described as &quot;ambiguous.&quot; Many people die without ever being considered &quot;dying&quot; or &quot;at the end of life.&quot; These people may miss out on the opportunity to close important relationships and make financial and legal arrangements that can benefit themselves and their survivors. They may inadvertently forgo palliative care that is available to comfort them physically, emotionally, and spiritually. This article calls for a broader conceptualization of the end of life to include not just the time when death is foreseeable, but also the time when people are at a greatly increased risk of death, although the timing is highly uncertain.

The model suggests goals in supervising such social workers and outlines the means and techniques for achieving the goals.,Hope as a strategy in supervising social workers of terminally ill patients.,2004,United States,Health Soc Work"Members of the Association of Oncology Social Workers completed a survey, which included the Hospice Philosophy Scale (HPS) assessing the likelihood of the worker referring a terminally ill patient to hospice, background and experience, and demographics. The respondents held overwhelmingly favorable attitudes toward hospice philosophy and care, yet the average proportion of terminally ill patients whom they referred to hospice was only 49.5 percent. The worker's HPS score was related significantly, although weakly, to the likelihood of referral. A follow-up study was undertaken to determine the reasons for the discrepancy between the workers' self-reported favorable attitudes toward hospice and their relatively low rate of patient referral. The factor identified most frequently was resistance from families because of the requirement that hospice patients discontinue active treatment.",Oncology social workers' attitudes toward hospice care and referral behavior.,2004,United States,Health Soc Work"Data were collected from 213 nurses and 61 social workers at major hospitals across Israel. Whereas nurses reported being more involved in the daily care of terminally ill patients, social workers reported being more involved in discussions with patients and family members. Nurses were more willing than social workers to use artificial feeding and less willing to use mechanical ventilation and CPR for all conditions. Social workers expressed stronger beliefs about their involvement in end-of-life issues.

Despite its obvious benefit in terms of time-effectiveness, group education around advance directives has received little previous attention in the social work research literature. In a retrospective cohort (n = 13,913), we compared three education strategies in an attempt to evaluate their effectiveness on advance directive completion: (1) participation in a group session, (2) one or more individual sessions with a social worker, and (3) no advance directive education. Social work education of any kind resulted in an overall completion rate of 20% versus 2.1% in the non-intervention group. Group education was twice as effective as an individual social work session, and as effective as multiple sessions, but less time consuming. Our study confirmed previous findings that older patients are more likely to complete advance directives independent of education strategy. Participants in the group sessions were also older than the rest of the cohort, leading us to hypothesize about the particular appeal of group education to older patients. We conclude that group education is an effective as well as time- and cost-efficient social work tool for facilitating completion of advance medical directives, particularly among older patients.",Advance directive group education in a VA outpatient clinic.,2004,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The number of male caretakers (biological fathers and other men) of HIV-infected and affected children is substantial and may increase in the US and elsewhere as more women become infected. Little information exists about the needs these men have for support services to help them better perform their parenting roles as male caretakers (MCs). This paper discusses the service needs of MCs at Ryan White CARE Act Title IV programs, the challenges providers at these programs face in serving MCs, and the strategies they have found effective in working with MCs. Providers report that MCs have specific service needs including the need for emotional support. Title IV programs meet these needs in a limited way because they are organized primarily around the needs of female rather than male caretakers. We discuss how Title IV programs can tailor existing service delivery and implement organizational change to facilitate MCs' service access and utilization. Further research directly with MCs is necessary to learn more about their service needs and the barriers MCs face in accessing services.",Service needs of male caretakers of HIV-infected and affected children: policy and practice implications.,2004,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Despite the widespread support for integrated community care in the U.K., interdisciplinary working between health and social service staff remains complex and tentative. This paper represents the findings of an evaluative research study of two collaborative community nursing schemes at differing stages of project development within West Yorkshire, England. The studies set out to explore in depth the ways social and health care professionals construe their identity and relationships within the changing context of collaborative projects. The research adopted a constructivist phenomenological approach, conducting focus groups with social workers and district nurses; supplemented by in-depth individual interviews. Using template analysis enabled the researchers to explore themes and issues generated from the groups and individuals. A number of areas associated with professional identity and the development of roles in response to changing situations were identified as pertinent including; role ambiguity, role erosion and extension. In cases where joint working required a reconstructing of professional identity, individuals were constrained by their personal meanings, organizational arrangements and public perceptions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.",Professional identities and interprofessional relations: evaluation of collaborative community schemes.,2004,United States,Soc Work Health Care"With a growth in home-care, and increased funding for dialysis, there is a need for the field of Social Work to understand the life-world of people who experience home haemodialysis technology (HDDT). Given little research has focussed on the lived-experiences of this population (Nagle, 1995), an exploratory qualitative study was employed (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998). The study investigated the embodied life-world experiences of this population using phenomenological methods (Kvale, 1996; van Manen, 1997). The data was collected and analyzed in terms of the four basic phenomenological categories of lived-time, lived-body, lived-spatiality, lived-relations with others and self (van Manen, 1997). A purposive sample of four was selected, and interviewed using semi-structured interviews, with each participant experiencing various lengths of HHDT. The findings revealed that their life-world had been transformed by their experience of HHDT. In particular, it was documented how participants' adoption of medical practice and discourse has impacted the lived-body, suggesting a need to adopt a plain language or holistic medical discourse practice approach for communication with patients which supports bodily-integrity and sovereignty. Additional findings centered on the incorporation of HHDT into the family unit, and how HHDT may present a health care access barrier to those without homes. Moreover, aspects of the transformation of the home into a hospital were highlighted. Finally, it is suggested that social assessment should consider the patient and family's experience of the dialysis machine.",Transformations: a phenomenological investigation into the life-world of home haemodialysis.,2004,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study aimed to examine the quality of life of patients undergoing different types of treatment for End Stage Renal Disease at various points in the course of the disease. The theoretical model that guided the study was based on the work of Rolland (1987) and Wilson and Clearly (1995). Subjects were 72 patients at the largest nephrology center in Israel. Instruments included the SF-36 Health Survey (version 1.0) and Parfrey's health questionnaire for End Stage Renal Disease. The findings indicate that the negative effects of the disease on quality of life can be observed in the pre-dialysis stage, and that the strongest predictor of quality of life were patients' symptom reports, independent of objective indicators of their health state. Social workers play a key role in aiding patients and their families to adjust to the disease and its treatment prior to starting dialysis, and in bringing the importance of patients' subjective assessments to the attention of the treatment team.",Quality of life of patients with end-stage renal disease at various stages of the illness.,2004,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper reports qualitative data from a multidisciplinary, multimethod Craniopharyngioma Child and Family Impact Study conducted at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. The study aimed to assess the psychosocial impact on children and their families of a childhood craniopharyngioma, a congenital non-hereditary brain tumour that is 'benign' by histology, but often locally invasive. The condition may result in significant morbidity and mortality due to location in the brain, which tends to precipitate multisystemic abnormalities either at the time of presentation, or in conjunction with treatment. The condition has a high survival rate with approximately 90 percent of children alive ten years after diagnosis and although the diagnosis and treatment of craniopharyngioma may result in severe physical and emotional burden for the child and family, there have been few studies to date on the psychosocial impact of this multifaceted condition. Interviews incorporating a purpose-designed Craniopharyngioma Symptom and Treatment Impact Scale were held with 13 families. Impacts on both the family and the children were identified as well as information about the child's coping capacity; parents' fear, uncertainty and trust; family managing and mastery; the experience of hospital; service use and illness specific support.

An interview guide of open-ended questions was used with a convenience sample of 17 home health care social workers. Constant comparative analysis was used to examine factors contributing to ethical tension. Three areas emerged as highly relevant to participants ethical decisions: (1) clinical uncertainty, (2) pressure from other professionals, and (3) a combination of pressure from other professionals and clinical uncertainty. Clinical uncertainty was influenced by partial cognitive impairment, mental health problems, the interplay of health and mental health, and unclear etiology of poor decisional capacity.

In an NIDA-funded demonstration project to increase technology in agencies that serve drug abusing populations, researchers logged all email and memorandum communication for a two and a half year period. These communications documented the progress of the intervention from inception to implementation. Using a qualitative methodology, researchers for this analysis examined the communication documents, noting themes. A core theme focusing on barriers to implementing technology emerged from the data. These barriers included: agency personnel's lack of computer proficiency, lack of motivation for agency personnel to participate in the intervention, and agency personnel not following intervention protocols, having computer hardware and networking problems, the agency's physical structure (lack of space/computers), and the researchers/interventionists having restricted access to agency personnel.",Technology trauma: barriers to increasing technology utilization.,2003,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Caring for an ill or disabled relative is a life experience shared by many women.

Using the conceptual framework of caregiving-related stress, we compared women who care for a parent, and women who care for another relative. The study found more instrumental difficulties, which lead to greater burden, among women who care for a disabled relative who is not a parent. Furthermore, larger proportions of women caring for a disabled relative who is not a parent report depressive mood symptoms, poor health status, and the need for psychological counseling.

Early identification of elderly patients needing community and hospital nonmedical services is necessary so that timely appropriate services can be delivered. This study addresses the issue of whether a standardized health-related quality of life questionnaire, the SF-36, can be used independently as a screen predicting primary care elderly patients' needs for social work assessment. In addition, the question of what scales on the SF-36 a social worker would use to screen patients in need of assessment is explored.",Standardized screening of elderly patients' needs for social work assessment in primary care: use of the SF-36.,2003,United States,Health Soc Work,Coming of age!,2003,United States,Health Soc WorkResearch over the last 12 years has repeatedly shown that African-American ESRD patients are less likely than white patients to be referred for a transplant evaluation. This article takes an exploratory look at issues surrounding this racial disparity. Among the issues focused on are: (a) the multiple ramifications from this racial disparity; (b) neglected factors which may be militating against the equitable referral of African-American patients; and (c) the vulnerabilities of this patient population.

Interviews were conducted to provide preliminary psychometric information on coping and distress instruments in this predominantly Mexican American population as well as to examine psychosocial factors related to individual adjustment to HIV among Latina females. Refusal rates were low in this study (approximately 10%) and measurement instruments generally had acceptable internal consistency reliability.

Qualitative research methodology was utilized to identify themes about the grief reactions expressed by caregivers. Results found that although some caregivers reported that they were not grieving, there was still a strong sense of loss in their descriptions of their caregiving experience. Additionally, for the caregivers who reported that they were grieving, their grief was characterized by multiple losses that accumulated during the disease process.",Are they grieving?

The social adjustment and psychological distress of 49 patients (34 women and 15 men) undergoing active medical care (chemotherapy and radiation) were assessed. Socio-demographic and medical parameters were also examined to account for differences in adjustment. Three questionnaires were used: A personal information questionnaire; a Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS-SR) (Derogatis &amp; Lopez, 1983); and a psychological distress one (BSI) (Derogatis &amp; Spencer, 1982). Significant differences were found between men and women patients in several dimensions of the social adjustment, psychological distress and medical variables.

Traditional agency-based home care often is considered safer for disabled clients because workers are professionally trained and monitored; newer, client-directed home care models offer more autonomy and flexibility. This study examined differences in worker abuse and neglect of clients across agency and consumer-directed models. Analyses showed that family ties, race or ethnicity, social supports, language compatibility, and provider turnover were more relevant than model of care to understanding worker abuse and neglect of clients. These findings suggest that clients in consumer-directed models are at no higher risk than agency clients.

Although AS has been portrayed as more acceptable than VE, social workers make only a minor distinction in their support for the legalization of such acts (VE 72.4%; AS 77.6%). Only 26.6% agreed with the US Supreme Court's ruling that assisted suicide is not a constitutional right. More than 75% believe that social workers should be involved in the decision-making process with clients who are considering VE/AS. About 20% of social workers report being consulted about VE/AS issues either by clients or in their personal lives. Social workers employed in medical settings are more than twice as likely to be consulted about VE/AS than those employed in non-medical settings.

The study is phenomenological in nature, using elements of grounded theory and social constructionism to consider the data collected. As examples of the issues raised using the narrative approach, the paper describes four themes that were pervasive in the first-person accounts of these individuals: 1. Emotional reaction to the diagnosis--Because of both the form and content in the narratives, these are described as 'peak experiences'; 2. Impact of stress--As a precipitator of symptoms or illness, as an ongoing aggravator of the chronic illness, or as a factor in overall coping with the chronic illness; 3. View of death--Named by all four individuals as it relates to their view of life; 4. Illness meaning--Coined by two of the individuals as 'philosophy of life.'

Protease inhibitors, antiviral therapies, and entitlements were reported as the most needed services, while entitlements and money to pay for housing were reported as the largest unmet needs. Differences across ethnic and gender groups were observed. One-third of all respondents reported at least one occasion of unprotected anal or vaginal intercourse in the previous six months. The practice of unsafe sex was found to be significantly related to both the number of needed services and the number of unmet needs, even after controlling for demographic variables. In addition, a higher proportion of those who engaged in unsafe sex reported a higher need for psychological counseling and social support.

Forty-seven medical social workers from seven hospitals participated in small group interviews in which practice experiences were explored. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data, with emotional dissonance emerging as a central theme. Community, family, and individual factors contributing to emotional dissonance are presented, and the effect of social support is examined.",Emotional dissonance in medical social work practice.,2003,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper reports results from six women who had miscarried and their partners in Melbourne. A qualitative approach, namely in-depth semi-structured interviews, was utilised to obtain information. Several themes emerged from the data. The findings of this study show that women and men experienced a variety of feelings in reaction before, during and after the miscarriage. These feelings varied in type, intensity, and duration in which the men generally experienced less intense feelings for a shorter period of time as compared to the women. We argue that support and counselling be provided not only for women who miscarry, but also for their male partner, as the men may have fewer means to express their grief due to the &quot;social expectation&quot; of male roles.",Pregnancy loss: what it means to women who miscarry and their partners.,2003,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The purpose of the current study was to assess the practical and psychosocial needs of rural women with early breast cancer in Australia and recommend strategies to ensure equity in availability and access to cancer treatment for all women. A random sample of 204 rural women diagnosed with early breast cancer was recruited to participate in a telephone survey via state and territory cancer registries. Although the majority of women were satisfied with their provision of information overall, less than a third of participants were provided with specific information on assistance for rural women. Findings also revealed that only 47% of the women who had to travel for treatment received financial assistance, and 13% of these women had difficulty organizing or claiming financial assistance. Furthermore, only 10% of women found social workers to be a source of support.",Assessing the practical and psychosocial needs of rural women with early breast cancer in Australia.,2003,United States,Soc Work Health CareHospitals have traditionally been large employers of social workers. As workplaces they are often identified as being challenging and ambiguous environments for social work practice. In this study the experience of hospital work is explored. Social workers' 'tolerance' of the hospital environment is identified as a way of explaining 'staying.' Staying has both positive and negative features which arise from the interaction between workers' tolerance of the environment and their qualities of 'self-actualisation.' The identification of this relationship informs and challenges existing theories of retention and turnover of workers.,Staying in hospital social work.,2003,United States,Soc Work Health Care"In past reviews of the literature on psychosocial interventions for cancer patients, different reviewers have reached disparate conclusions about the ability of a psychosocial intervention to have an impact on cancer survival. This article highlights some of the basis for differences of opinion, including the range of psychosocial interventions provided to patients and the challenges inherent in conducting research studies of this type. Social workers who work with cancer patients at vulnerable times need to understand what the current evidence shows can be gained from participation in a psychosocial intervention. Several key questions have been identified that can provide the basis for future rigorous studies. The role of the social worker in participating and shaping research on the relationship of psychosocial intervention and cancer survival is also discussed.",Separating the apples and oranges in the fruit cocktail: the mixed results of psychosocial interventions on cancer survival.,2003,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Sampled private practitioners from the Register of Clinical Social Workers, American Psychological and Psychiatric Associations were used to evaluate what percentage of these practitioners' caseloads are made up of clients who have been denied reimbursement by managed care organizations for ongoing therapy.

The psychosocial assessment form was guided by two theoretical models that explain the variability in adjustment among children and adolescents with sickle cell--the Disability-Stress-Coping Model (Wallender, Varni, Babani, Banis, &amp; Wilcox, 1989) and the Transactional Stress and Coping Model (Thompson, Gustafson, George Spock, 1994). The Psychosocial Assessment Form consists of two sections. The first section includes primary indicators of adjustment such as internalizing disorders, externalizing disorders, school performance, and difficulties in social relationships. The second section lists secondary indicators of adjustment including intrapersonal factors, stress processing factors, and social ecological factors.

The researchers developed an ethical activism scale that measured the extent medical social workers engaged in such ethical activism, confirming its reliability from data obtained from a sample of 162 medical social workers in 37 hospitals in the Los Angeles basin. They tested seven hypotheses that probed the extent specific ethics-training, organizational, and demographic variables influence the extent social workers engage in ethical activism. Data strongly suggest the need to expand ethics training to include tactics of ethical activism, since many social workers do not engage in ethical activism. Data also suggest the need to target such training to social workers in hospitals that are relatively unreceptive to social workers' participation in ethical deliberations, since social workers are least likely to engage in ethical activism in such settings.",Ethical activism: strategies for empowering medical social workers.,2003,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This report covers the development, process and outcomes of a yearlong diabetes problem solving support group.

The implications for professional disciplines have been dramatic in that departments such as social work have been dismantled and social work practice has come under the domain of program managers representing multiple disciplines. In this study 12 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, that were studied in the early stages of restructuring in 1995 expanded to 22 sites by 1999. The effect of the mergers and moves to program management on the social work profession was examined.

Moving beyond traditional clinical ethics and its dyadic focus on the physician-patient relationship, this article presents an approach to ethical decision-making at the end of life that is more inclusive of the patient's family and has the potential to advance social work practice in end-of-life care. Initial attention is given to how psychosocial and bioethical perspectives and practices interact to shape understanding of moral issues in end-of-life decisions. Morally relevant principles are then adapted from contextual therapy as being useful for including more of a family focus and viewing ethical decision-making at the end of life as a family process. Specifically, focus is on exploring the ethical dynamics of family systems that impact the decision-making process and translating psychosocial insight into ethical discussions that are supportive of families. The case of a patient with sudden and unexpected brain death and without advance directives demonstrates one family's unresolved grief and illustrates how its members were helped to reason morally about end-of-life choices.

It analyzes the changing mental health environment and the challenges facing social work. It stresses that the profession must adapt to the dramatic changes that have been taking place since the advent of deinstitutionalization and the need for community care for mentally ill persons. Historical analysis of the social work profession shows that its involvement in the mental health field has started during the early stages of the development of the profession. Psychiatric social work has been considered a prestigious area of practice within the profession. Historically, social workers in the mental health field rarely challenged the dominance of the psychiatric profession. This position seems to have restrained social work from providing its full potential contribution to this field of practice and to the population it served. Assessment of the continuing problems and current issues of the mental health system shows the potential central role of social work in this area. However, changes must take place in the practice of social workers in the mental health service system, as well as in the education and training of social workers. The paper discusses factors that facilitate or hinder the profession from appropriately adapting to the current service needs of the mentally ill persons, their families and communities, providing quality mental health and social services to this population and society as well.",The changing role of the social worker in the mental health system.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTs) offer the opportunity to integrate social workers and health professionals to provide multi-disciplinary assessment and care.

Yet, previous investigations have shown longer hospitalizations following a psychiatric emergency service (PES) evaluation reduce recidivism. This study examines the relationship between post-PES hospitalization, patient characteristics and involuntary PES return within 12 months. It is done in a context where average duration of post-PES hospitalizations are 6 days, approximately 1/4 the duration of previous studies reporting positive effects of such hospitalization.METHOD: Structured observations of PES evaluations of 417 patients were completed at 7 California county general hospitals. Follow-ups were conducted at 12 months after initial evaluation. Study objectives are evaluated using multivariate modeling.RESULTS: Subsequent to the initial evaluation, 121 of the 417 patients (29.0%) were involuntarily returned to the PES. The likelihood of involuntary return was increased by a psychotic diagnosis and the seriousness of initial clinical presentations on the TRIAD dangerousness criterion measure. Having insurance also increased the likelihood of involuntary return.CONCLUSIONS: As the patient's initial PES condition was found to be the best predictor of involuntary return and duration of post-PES hospitalization seemed to lose its prophylactic effect, it seems we have gone too far in reducing lengths of inpatient stays. We may have lost sight of the crucial role of this setting in stopping the revolving door and insuring appropriate care.",Involuntary return to a psychiatric emergency service within twelve months.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"National hospitalization records (1995, 1986, N = 15,698) reveal that Arab women utilize psychiatric services less than Arab men. The exact reverse occurs among Jewish patients. Moreover, Arab patients significantly underutilize mental health services, compared to Jewish patients. Possible reasons for these utilization patterns include: Arab health care utilization patterns in general; the availability of mental health services in Arab communities; the influence of the &quot;cultural&quot; over the &quot;professional&quot; in Arab mental health utilization; the lack of Arab mental health practitioners; Arab attitudes towards mental health; and gendered role constructions within Arab society.

These reforms have in large part been driven by governments' concerns for cost containment which has, in turn, been driven by an increasing process of global marketization and the need to control national deficits. A critical issue in these reforms is the increased emphasis on the use of &quot;market mechanisms&quot; in the delivery of health and mental health services. This paper uses a policy analysis framework to compare recent developments in the mental health sector in Canada, the United States, Britain and Australia. The common framework to be used for this will focus on: the defining characteristics of the society; legislative mandate; sectorial location (within or separate from health sector); funding streams; organising values of the system; locus of service delivery; service technologies; the role of social work; interprofessional dynamics; the role of consumers; and evaluation of outcomes at multiple levels.

However, health professionals have increasingly recognised that caring for persons who are from a Non-English Speaking Background (NESB) and for their families requires giving them special consideration because of their different cultural needs. This project involved reviewing all inpatient files of the SHH over a three year period (1 October 1994 to 30 September 1997) and quantitatively reviewing all inpatient files of NESB inpatients during this period. Following this review, the researchers coordinated a focus group that comprised various health professionals from SHH and other health and community services and representatives of four non-English speaking countries--Greece, Italy, the former USSR, and China.

While direct action coping strategies of problem-solving and compromise were used by immigrants to deal with recurring, daily resettlement difficulties, cognitive strategies of positive comparisons and positive and optimistic thinking were utilized to change the meanings of these difficulties. Emotion-focused coping of acceptance and avoidance strategies were culture-specific, and were useful in reducing the stress associated with the resettlement difficulties encountered. It was also found that strategies such as acceptance, compromise and avoidance might have deleterious effects on the longer-term adjustment of immigrants.

Meanwhile, such data could help health social workers better assist HIV-infected people who want to cope well, live long, and avoid drug resistance. Therefore, this article presents findings from a three-stage empirical secondary data analysis that examined seven specific types of social support, psychological history and stage of illness variables, and sociodemographics and their connection to medication compliance ratings. A sub-sample of 179 HIV-infected clinical trial study participants enrolled in a federally funded combination therapy treatment study and a nested compliance study were analyzed. Analysis of 14 bivariate hypotheses and 20 predictor variables at the multivariate level revealed that having emotional support and being employed seemed to be predictive of being a &quot;Good Complier.&quot; Also, having higher levels of HIV symptoms appeared to be associated with being a &quot;Poor Complier.&quot;","Social support, medication compliance and HIV/AIDS.",2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"As a life-threatening and potentially disabling disease, End Stage Renal Disease and its treatment cause stress as well as other psychosocial problems for patients and their families. This paper examines the results of an innovative activity-based intervention aimed at reducing some of the psychosocial repercussions of hemodialysis. A modified withdrawal/reversal design was employed to compare patients participating in the intervention and those who did not, at two points in time. The findings confirmed that dialysis patients in general have relatively high levels of psychological distress, difficulty adhering to the treatment regimen and poor self-rated health. Patients participating in the group activity were more anxious and had lower levels of interdialytic weight gain than the non-participants. After the intervention was terminated, levels of psychological distress, hostility and phobic anxiety among patients in the treatment group dropped, while their weight gain continued to be less than that of non-participating patients.

However, very few empirical studies examine the long-term adjustment of cancer survivors and the factors that promote survivors' well-being. This paper presents an 18 month follow-up study of 26 women who were treated for various types of cancer at a major medical center in the United States. They completed questionnaires during the initial treatment phase of the illness and 18 months later. The questionnaire consisted of standardized scales measuring relationship factors (i.e., mutuality, silencing-the-self schemas, and relationship-focused coping) and psychosocial well-being (i.e., quality of life, depression, self-care agency). The results of the follow-up study revealed that the women's psychosocial well-being changed for the better between Time 1 and Time 2, while their relationship factors remained constant. Only one relational factor, silencing-the-self beliefs, at Time 1, was significantly correlated with a well-being variable at Time 2. However, relationship factors at Time 2 were significantly correlated with psychosocial well-being at Time 2, indicating that relational factors continue to play a significant role in the sample's psychosocial adjustment.",A follow-up study of women with cancer: their psychosocial well-being and close relationships.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"In Queensland, Australia, senior social workers have pioneered the coordination of tissue donation at coronial autopsies, seeking consent for the donation of heart valve, bone and eye tissue after sudden deaths which have been reported to the coroner. The urgent need for tissue for transplantation is balanced with the counselling, information and practical needs of potential donor families in their shock and grief. Social work assessment, advocacy, liaison, counselling, crisis intervention and particularly communication skills have been utilised, both as an integral component of obtaining informed consent and in working with families' experience of grief and loss in sudden, traumatic bereavement. This tissue donation program, over a period of eight years, has maximised the availability of tissue with its high donation rates, while upholding the rights and needs of potential donor families through provision of an effective social work service.

While health promotion interventions leading to personal behavior change are known to reduce CVD in white, middle class, more educated populations, these approaches have not been widely tested in poor, minority ethnic communities. This paper describes a community intervention program to reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors in East Harlem, a low income New York City community in Manhattan, whose population is 53% Latino and 39% African American. This primary prevention model seeks to change attitudes, norms and values regarding behaviors that contribute to chronic disease within a defined population through initiating changes in the social, educational, cultural and physical environment. Environmental and organizational conditions that predict successful outcomes for the model and strategies, methods and skills, borrowed from social work and other behavioral sciences to implement and institutionalize community wide lifestyle changes, are highlighted.",Implementing a community intervention program for health promotion.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care,"Social work health and mental health: practice, research and programs, Part III.

Findings are reported from a study conducted to determine which reproductive health topics adolescents and their parents discuss, which immediate and extended family members discuss reproductive health topics with their female adolescent relatives, which family members and peers encourage female adolescents to use family planning services, and how adolescent age, pregnancy history, or parental encouragement of the use of family planning relates to the discussion of reproductive health topics. All females of maximum age 19 years registering for an appointment at 1 of 3 family planning clinics in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, were consecutively recruited to participate in the study. A survey of 249 female adolescent family planning clients found that women aged 13-16 years were more likely than women aged 17-19 years to discuss sexual behavior with adult, nonparental relatives (p = .007). Teens with a prior pregnancy were more likely than never-pregnant teens to report parental discussion of contraception choices (p = .004) and of sites for contraceptive care (p = .0023). Adolescents discuss sexuality with a complex network of family and peers. Social work clinical and community skills facilitate family-centered reproductive health training and counseling for the improved reproductive health of US adolescents.","Communication about sexual behavior among adolescent women, their family, and peers.",2002,UNITED STATES,Fam Soc"The treatment of postnatal depression (PND) via group therapy is an accepted practice in Sydney and other metropolitan areas throughout Australia. This article analyses the difficulties faced in the importation of this urban-developed treatment model into a rural setting. In 1995, this program was established in a major rural centre of New South Wales (NSW) and drew participants from the regional centre, surrounding rural properties, towns and villages. Participation in the program resulted in significant lowering or absences of depressive episodes following treatment. But beyond this significant aspect of a positive response to this treatment program is a fascinating aspect of differences between the rural and urban groups in this population. The differences occurred in group formation, group process and attitudes of the participants. We would suggest that group leaders in rural PND programs face more resistance to the idea of groups for therapeutic intervention, need to draw different lines between personal and professional boundaries from their urban counterparts and are confronted with participants who adhere more strongly to the prevailing mythology of motherhood. This mythology may increase the likelihood and intensity of postnatal depression and cause greater resistance to cognitive restructuring skills, which are essential for challenging thoughts that enhance depression.",It's just different in the country: postnatal depression and group therapy in a rural setting.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The re-engineered acute care environment that emphasizes managed care, reduced costs per case and shorter lengths of stay also demands innovative approaches to the delivery of social work service. As departments disappear and other professions compete for roles in counselling, discharge planning and community liaison, there is a real threat to the viability of the acute hospital as a setting for social work. This paper focuses on the adaptive skills needed for the restructured acute care context, including (1) the creation of key roles for social work on the multidisciplinary team, (2) pre-admission high-risk screening and discharge planning, (3) high volume recording, (4) solution-focused brief interventions, and (5) the development of community partnerships. These conceptual strategies are implemented differently in examples drawn from three distinct high-volume patient groups: reconstructive orthopaedics, high-risk fetal assessment and thoracic oncology.","Retooling social work practice for high volume, short stay.",2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Family-based caregiving refers to the daily provision of help to a co-resident family relative with the usual activities of daily living, custody and protection of a dependent relative at risk of self-injury, and support of a person with physical, developmental and/or mental disability or frailty due to ageing. Many reports from western studies refer to the caregiving burdens, stress and strains. A common view of migrant peoples is that they 'look after their own' to a greater extent than do English-speaking groups and that their closer connections with ethno-specific community organisations and with their extended family networks provides more opportunities for assistance and support so that caregiving is shared and the burdens are reduced. A study was carried out with 300 Australian-Greek families in Melbourne where 150 were providing family-based caregiving, and these were age and gender matched with friends or acquaintances who had no such duties. Most care was provided by women, although almost 20% of carers were men. A wide range of disabilities and illnesses were receiving help and care in the caregiving families among care recipients aged from childhood to advanced old age. Distinct evidence of caregiving burden was found to a significant degree. Gender differences were apparent in the type of disorders managed, in the perceived severity of caregiving duties provided and in the total range of activities engaged in. The ethno-specific community organisations and extended family networks played little part in providing assistance to caregivers which challenges the myths of a close-knit migrant community looking after its own. Qualitative reports of concerns for future caregiving were expressed and the implications for future service needs are discussed.",Keeping it in the family: caregiving in Australian-Greek families.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Using a grounded theory qualitative research, this study explored the strategies used by children to cope with abusive home environments. Through a series of three interviews, a group of adolescents and child care professionals were asked their perceptions regarding protective factors of resilience. These were then categorized into common patterns that emerged as five themes showing a progression of skills used by adolescents who were maltreated as children. These themes are: loyalty to parents, normalizing of the abusive environment, establishing a sense of safety through a perception of invisibility to the abuser, self value, and a future view. This research adds important knowledge to the body of practice skills in working with abusing families. Those children who have developed methods to cope provide us with valuable tools to assist other children who may continue to live in abusing environments.",Resilient children: what they tell us about coping with maltreatment.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"Under the division of labor of Western medicine, the medical physician treats the body of patients, the social worker attends to their emotions and social relations, while the pastoral counselor provides spiritual guidance. Body, mind, cognition, emotion and spirituality are seen as discrete entities. In striking contrast, Eastern philosophies of Buddhism, Taoism and traditional Chinese medicine adopt a holistic conceptualization of an individual and his or her environment. In this view, health is perceived as a harmonious equilibrium that exists between the interplay of 'yin' and 'yang': the five internal elements (metal, wood, water, fire and earth), the six environmental conditions (dry, wet, hot, cold, wind and flame), other external sources of harm (physical injury, insect bites, poison, overeat and overwork), and the seven emotions (joy, sorrow, anger, worry, panic, anxiety and fear). The authors have adopted a body-mind-spirit integrated model of intervention to promote the health of their Chinese clients. Indeed, research results on these body-mind-spirit groups for cancer patients, bereaved wives and divorced women have shown very positive intervention outcomes.

Although the improvement of relationships between social workers and primary health care teams has been promoted for a number of years, the advent of formal policies for community care has made this a priority for both social services and health. This paper presents interim findings from the evaluation of three pilot projects in Nottinghamshire, Great Britain. These findings are analysed from three linked perspectives. The first is the extent to which structures and organisations have worked effectively together to promote the location of social workers within health care settings. The second is the impact of professional and cultural factors on the work of the social worker in these settings. The third is the effect of interpersonal relationships on the success of the project. The paper will conclude that there is significant learning from each of these perspectives which can be applied to the future location of social workers to primary health care.",Community care in practice: social work in primary health care.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care,Substance abuse and elderly people.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,Social work and the art of substance abuse counseling.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,Defining substance abusers using a prism: what you see is what you get.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,A comparison of drug use between welfare-receiving arrestees and non-welfare-receiving arrestees.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,The Xchange point: a drop-in center for African American active injection drug users.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,Harm reduction and injection drug use: pragmatic lessons from a public health model.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,Treatment with lesbian alcoholics: healing shame and internalized homophobia for ongoing sobriety.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,Structured stories: reinforcing social skills in rural substance abuse treatment.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,Brief motivational intervention for substance-abusing delinquent adolescents: guided self-change as a social work practice innovation.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work,Families helping families: implementing a multifamily therapy group with substance-abusing adolescents.,2002,United States,Health Soc Work"The study discussed in this article describes the alcohol-related policies, practices, and problems experienced by a sample of 111 intermediate care facilities and homes for elderly people.

Because poor women and women of color face a greater probability of being prosecuted or losing custody of their children for using drugs while they are pregnant, the article emphasizes societal responses to these client populations.

Responsibility for care has increasingly shifted to ill persons themselves and to their families and friends. Reduced hospital stays, service privatization and user fees have been implemented to some degree in both countries. These changes are reverberating throughout Finnish and Canadian societies, affecting not only users of health care but also the labour force in health workplaces. Health social workers, at the front line with clients, have experienced new issues which have impacted on their practice with ill persons and their families. In an environment of health care restructuring, they have needed to draw upon their repertoires of knowledge, skills and community networks in order to respond. At the same time, social workers noted that there is a leaner package of health and social service benefits to support patients and families. Social workers have tried to adapt and find new opportunities to practice social work in the changed environment. This small study, initially conducted as a pilot for a larger study, compared the experiences of social workers in Canada and Finland and the perceived impacts of health restructuring on their clients. The findings, seen within the context of changing societal and institutional environments, can help us to better understand some of the impacts of health restructuring on social work and social workers in hospitals and local health centres. Indirectly and directly, these changes also affect clients in the health care system, those whose needs remain uppermost in the delivery of social work services.",Social work and health restructuring in Canada and Finland.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The economic and social philosophies of the &quot;New Right&quot; which emphasise individualism and self-fulfillment have become wide-spread. In the last two decades it has grown particularly strong in Western societies. Self-fulfillment of the individual now commands its own moral imperative, and promotes the shutting out of the greater issues and concerns (political, historical and religious) that transcend the self.

It argues that a life course approach is necessary to understand social variations in health. It explores the accumulation of risk for the underprivileged in the market environment, with its concomitant constraints on human services. The paper reviews the inherent and fundamental conflict of objectives in the ethical positioning of social organizations, as against those of the ew Right.&quot; Finally, the paper argues for social and economic policies that would defend the socio-economically disadvantaged against an accumulation of risk in the critical periods of their life.

The paper arose out of research conducted by the authors into the effectiveness of certain human service interventions. It begins with an outline of the agency in which the research took place. It presents a brief overview of the development of contracting and then considers four key issues raised by this development from both the international literature and from the authors' experience of researching a social service agency. These issues are: defining what is to be purchased, accountability mechanisms, specificity/fragmentation and partial funding. The paper identifies that central components of the first two issues are informational, the third is about control and the fourth is about reducing government spending and extending state control over the activities of the not-for-profit sector.","The buck stops where?

Among them are more efficient mechanisms for introducing curriculum changes, greater emphasis on research and evaluations skills, systematic monitoring of health care programs, preparation of public impact reports, better utilization of modern information technologies, and the introduction of mini-courses that can be adapted readily to emerging health care and educational needs.",Health care and social work education in a changing world.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"OBJECTIVES: (1) To test lists of problems in the three axes of well-being (physical, mental, and social) with the GPs' collaboration (2) To place the resulting classification in the context of other ones aiming at collecting data about psycho-social aspects of life (assessment, index and classification systems). (3) To test if GPs would be induced to record psychological and social problems more often in their everyday practice, after having been trained to look more closely at them, inter allia with the use of classification and codes.METHOD: The lists of problems have been initiated by the WHO Department of Mental Health and discussed at an international symposium; they were then tested on the field, first at an international level, then in Belgium. After discussion by 4 Belgian GPs' Teaching Units, they were then improved. In all surveys concerned, general practitioners were asked to collaborate in three ways: opening their usual medical records and collaborating to prospective phases, including one &quot;test phase,&quot; i.e., a training session, recording problems with the use of coding lists, and looking for the proper code. Retrospective and prospective approaches were used both before and after this test phase.RESULTS: (1) The original lists of problems have been improved on the basis of the findings in medical files and in the survey. (2) A conceptual framework is presented for recording social problems, either in everyday practice (i.e., in health records) or in research settings, e.g., for social surveys. It is biaxial: domains and types of problem. (3) Training GPs for using such a coding system drastically increases the number of psycho-social problems, but only during the prospective phases.

The need for such a system arose through changes in funding arrangements based on the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) treated within hospitals. In Australian hospitals, the mix of DRGs treated became known as its 'casemix.' These new funding arrangements made it necessary for Social Work to classify and measure activity with each patient to ensure continuing resource allocation to social work services in hospitals. A national Casemix Network was formed under the auspice of the Australian Association of Social Workers to develop a classification system. The Network worked collaboratively with other allied health professions to produce a generic framework for professional activities and also developed a classification of social work interventions. These activity classifications have been incorporated into procedure coding in Australian hospitals. The challenges associated with casemix funding required Social Work to address a number of philosophical and methodological issues related to classification of professional activities to ensure an outcome that recognised the unique contribution of Social Work to health care.",The development of an Australian national classification system for social work practice in health care.,2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"The aim of this study was to identify the functions performed by social workers specifically engaged in paediatric discharge planning by undertaking a detailed analysis of discharge planning practice in forty cases referred to a specialist discharge planning team, at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melborne.

Specifically, it was hypothesized that cognitive control mediated the effect of exposure to stressful circumstances on distress. A total of 159 Korean immigrants participated in the study. The result of the study provided strong support for the role of cognitive control in mediating the relationship between stressful circumstances and distress. The detrimental effect of exposure to stressful circumstances on distress was weakened by cognitive control.

This article examines the present and potential effect of such litigation, focusing on the recent Supreme Court decision in Pegram v. Herdrich and class action litigation-filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The author concludes that although court-based reforms are a necessary and pragmatic response to managed care, they can result in only incremental changes. Litigation also cannot resolve the larger conflicts that result when a social welfare service such as health care is provided through a corporate model. Social workers need to look beyond the &quot;next best&quot; reform of managed care and advocate for more fundamental solutions to the inequities and inefficiencies in the provision of health care.",Managed care and the judicial system: another avenue for reform?,2002,United States,Health Soc Work"An exploratory study of the experiences, beliefs, and preferences of uninsured workers found that uninsured workers are active in seeking solutions to their health care needs and have decided opinions about health care. They use a cost-benefit analysis in deciding which health problems warrant professional attention. However, uninsured workers also exhibit a contradictory pattern of behaviors and beliefs. They say their health is good, yet many have illnesses that they neglect. They are satisfied with the health care services they use, yet they want health insurance because they believe it provides more choice and ensures better care and treatment. They express few negative feelings about Medicaid, yet even among the poorest of these workers, few have recently used Medicaid.

The analysis focuses on how and why adolescents terminate from treatment and identifies variables associated with &quot;acknowledged&quot; and &quot;unacknowledged&quot; terminations. Findings indicate that termination was acknowledged infrequently, often a brief process that occurred almost as frequently by telephone as in the context of treatment. Contrary to &quot;practice wisdom&quot; concerning treatment termination, adolescents who &quot;dropped out&quot; without a &quot;clinical process&quot; reported considerably more engagement in treatment than those who acknowledged the termination of treatment.

To explore the effects of psychosocial risk factors empirically, available information collected from 435 women screened with the original instrument between 1992-93 was converted into a quantitative data-base. The intention was to conduct a retrospective study of the prenatal patient population, including demographic characteristics, problems presented, social work interventions, and treatment outcomes. Among the findings anxiety and ambivalence related to pregnancy were significant risk factors.

Despite its abundance and non-intrusiveness, social work researchers generally have ignored available clinical information, claiming that it is unreliable and subject to too many threats to validity to warrant serious consideration as a data source. Instead, many researchers have advocated &quot;gold standard&quot; experimental studies, employing standardized instruments and prospective data-collection. As a result, the research potential of retrospective studies based on available clinical information has been relatively unexplored and untested.

We aimed to examine the role of social workers in improving kidney patient outcomes and to determine the potential of readily available patient information for studying this process. The findings showed considerable differences between the patient samples in both countries, as far as the socio-demographic background was considered. In spite of this, there were numerous similarities in the type of psycho-social problems and reactions, as well as the social workers' interventions.

A convenience sample was used to select 71 Jewish and 21 African American residents age 65 and older. Face-to-face interviews were conducted at a single point in time and incorporated four scales that measure strength of ethnic identity, adjustment and satisfaction with residency. Ethnic behavior was the only ethnic identity measure that was significantly associated with resident adjustment and with satisfaction. The two ethnic groups did not differ significantly in the association of ethnic identity with adjustment and satisfaction.

The Behavioral Model of Health Care Utilization was used to organize the study. Living with a spouse or children reduced the risk as did being socially active. High income reduced the risk but there were problems in the measurement of income. Higher levels of functional disability predicted higher risk. Being Black or being female reduced the risk of admission. Age was a predictor of increased risk. Beyond these findings this paper provides support for the importance of gathering and utilizing data that allows for predictor variables to vary with time.","Impact of social support, diversity, and poverty on nursing home utilization in a nationally representative sample of older Americans.",2002,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study investigates the importance of social time spent at a remodeled kidney center among hemodialysis recipients.

This study, in a large university teaching acute care hospital in Canada, examined the effect of psychosocial problems on length of stay, controlling for patient demographics and medical condition. Average days stay for Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGs) was used as a proxy variable for severity of medical condition, and the Person-in-Environment (PIE) classification system was used to measure psychosocial problems. Data were collected on a sample of 160 patients; 78 in psychiatry and 82 in medical/surgical wards. In a regression analysis, the severity of the patient's psychosocial problem was a more significant predictor of length of stay than the DRG variable. The identification of psychosocial problems and their severity add an important and complementary dimension to research into the effectiveness of social workers in reducing length of stay.

The second, more long term goal is to increase understanding of the biology of alcoholism and to use this understanding to develop new targeted medications to prevent alcohol use problems and to improve treatment outcome. Considerable research progress has been made over the past three decades toward achieving each goal. The careful study of existing therapies and the development of both behavioral strategies and medications, such as naltrexone, have helped improve treatment success. New neuroscience techniques have led to an increased understanding of how alcohol's actions in the brain are related to the phenomenon of addiction, and new imaging techniques have permitted scientists to study alcohol's effects on the brain and to link these effects to behavior in ways not even possible just a few years ago. Finally, genetics researchers are using both animal and human genetics techniques to identify the genes that confer vulnerability to alcoholism and developing ways to apply this information to clinical populations. As a result of increased understanding of the biology of alcohol dependence, future clinicians will need to understand not just the traditional behavioral nuances of alcoholism treatment, but the biology of alcohol dependence as well.","Improving the old, embracing the new: implications of alcohol research for future practice.",2001,United States,Soc Work Health Care,The Eighth Doris Siegel Memorial Conference tribute.,2001,United States,Soc Work Health Care,"Ethics, managed care, and outpatient psychotherapy.",2001,United States,Clin Soc Work J,Patient advocacy in psychiatry: the Austrian and the Dutch models.,2001,United States,Int Soc Work,Clinical trials: opportunities and responsibilities.,2001,United States,Health Soc Work,Clinical trials: a wider lens 2.,2001,United States,Health Soc Work,Clinical trials: a wider lens.,2001,United States,Health Soc Work,A call to action: patients' access to clinical trials.,2001,United States,Health Soc Work"The potential for the social worker-client relationship to contribute to therapeutic outcomes is not always apparent with clients who have schizophrenia.

Whereas American Indian students with better grades in school held consistently stronger antidrug norms, there were few differences by gender, socioeconomic status, or age. These results have implications in social work practice for better understanding and strengthening the protective aspects of American Indian culture in drug prevention efforts.","Ethnic pride, biculturalism, and drug use norms of urban American Indian adolescents.",2001,United States,Soc Work Res"This article outlines and reflects on the current procedure in Israel for requesting late pregnancy terminations and the subsequent decision-making processes. The study population consisted of 183 women who requested late termination of pregnancy (LTP) in Israel during the years 1995-97. The main causes for requests were fetal anomalies and late application. Eighty-two percent of requests were approved, and approval could be predicted by the week of gestation and the reason for application. Ethical dilemmas are described. The need to enhance professional support for women who request LTP, whether they receive approval or not, should be addressed by the health system and social workers in health care.",The decision-making process for requests for late termination of pregnancy in Israel.,2001,United States,Health Soc Work"Failure to thrive (FTT) is a diagnostic term used to describe infants and children who fail to grow and develop at a normal rate. There has been limited literature focused on the role social workers play in working with children who fail to thrive. Because the focus of the current health care system is on using an interdisciplinary team approach, it is crucial that social workers make a place for themselves on treatment teams and continue to use their skills to provide comprehensive treatment.

HIV drug therapies are essential to the survival and to improved quality of life for individuals with HIV. However, not all people with HIV disease are receiving these medications. The state AIDS drug assistance programs (ADAPs) can provide access to drug therapies for many people with HIV disease who lack adequate drug coverage. This research presents the results of a national survey that identified eligibility-related policies implemented by .48 state ADAPs during 1998 and 1999. The survey assessed the number of people receiving ADAP coverage, the percentage of ADAP beneficiaries who are women, financial and medical eligibility requirements, characteristics of the application process, any implementation of waiting lists, and any coordination of the ADAPs with other public programs.",Eligibility policies for the state AIDS drug assistance programs.,2001,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This study investigates factors associated with requests for professional services, made by newly registered HIV/AIDS Clinic outpatients, referred by general practice physicians to a large urban hospital serving a broad metropolitan/rural area in Canada. Professional service requests were divided into two primary help-seeking categories: practical support (assistance with financial aid, housing, medication costs, etc.) and emotional support (i.e., psychological counselling). Slightly more than half of the sample (51%) of people living with HIV/AIDS (PHA) requested professional services. Service requesters are indistinguishable from non-requesters on a large number of variables, including age, gender, family awareness of HIV/AIDS diagnosis, time elapsed since diagnosis, employment status, spousal status, overall support network size, physical health indicators (Karnofsky Performance Status, CD4 count, symptoms, opportunistic infections) and receipt of community support services elsewhere. Similarly, requesters and non-requesters report comparable levels of overall perceived social support and quality of life. However, requesters of practical support services report significantly fewer friends, lower emotional-informational social support and poorer quality of life due to body pain than non-requesters. Requesters of emotional support services report experiencing significantly lower positive social interaction compared to non-requesters.

At the beginning of the 21st century, in many cases, the process of dying has become invisible. Today, most deaths occur in old age. Social workers have a key role as &quot;context interpreters&quot; in helping people at the end of life and their families understand the natural course of the illness, the process of dying, and the advantages and drawbacks of medical interventions.

Patient quality of life changes were measured by the SF-36. A paired samples t-test showed significant diminishment in patients' mental quality of life indicating diminished overall emotional functioning, negatively impacting quality of life; possibly due to the effects of time. Multiple regression results also indicated that patients at risk for major depression and at risk for major depression superimposed on dysthymia experienced significantly diminished mental quality of life.

Findings revealed that while ethical decision-making in hospitals is an interdisciplinary process, social workers' contribution to the process is affected by rivalry between social workers and other members of the health team, personality differences, type of ward and the nature of the ethical dilemma. Participants of the study had quite a clear perception of their role and of the unique knowledge-base social work can offer, including knowledge of the individual and family life course, understanding and skills in coping with diseases, and systems thinking. In order to increase their influence in ethical decision-making, the hospital social workers felt they must put more effort into developing their relationships with the other professionals involved in ethical decision-making both by making themselves more indispensable and by making their contribution explicit through greater documentation of their activities.

However, employment has been found to buffer the strain produced by stressful life events. The purpose of this study was to examine the differential effects of employment on physical and mental health between elderly men bereaved for one year and elderly men bereaved for two to three years. We selected two groups of men from the Normative Aging Study: those bereaved within the past year (N = 248) and those bereaved from two to three years (N = 262). Ordinary least squares multiple regression analyses examined the direct effect of employment, controlling for age, education, income, marital status, and stress, on physical and mental health among the two groups of men. Although there were no significant differences between the two groups of men, the results from the separate analyses indicated that employment had a direct positive effect on physical health among those bereaved for one year and those bereaved from two to three years, but no significant effects were observed on mental health. The results suggest that employment can benefit men soon after a bereavement event and also over a longer period of time, especially on physical health.

Jewish subjects, as well as those who relied on God, were better educated and more anxious about death, had significantly more positive attitudes toward life-sustaining treatments at the end-of-life. On the other hand, those who had implemented ADs desired fewer life-sustaining treatments. Findings demonstrate that understanding individual desires for life-sustaining treatments is complex.

Complex ethical issues arise from decisions regarding use of advancing medical technologies and/or other artificial treatments that may prolong life and/or compromise its quality. NASW has set forth a policy to help guide social workers dealing with end-of-life care decisions and the preservation of client self-determination in these situations. However, the present study (N = 63) revealed that a majority (57%) of social workers were not aware of the existence of, or were only somewhat familiar with the policy. Ethical dilemmas most often faced in end-of-life care situations related primarily to issues of communication between and among patients, families, and professionals. Practitioners indicated that more specific practice guidelines and increased education regarding bioethics and issues of end-of-life care are needed to be effective in assisting patients and families in end-of-life decision making.","Health care social workers' views of ethical issues, practice, and policy in end-of-life care.",2001,United States,Soc Work Health Care"An area of disaster response with high risk of inducing trauma in response workers is recovering and identifying human remains.

This paper analyzes self-reported views of actual collaborative activities between 50 pairs of social workers and physicians on a specific shared case in an acute care hospital setting. Through examining the degree of congruence in perspectives of each pair of collaborators, we compare the two professions' views of the collaborative process and outcome. Additionally, each profession's outlook on its own and the other profession's roles and responsibilities in the case is examined. Our findings indicate that many social work and physician collaborators share similar perspectives about many aspects of their joint patient care endeavors. Where there was disagreement within a pair, almost always, it was a social worker selecting or discussing a variable when her physician counterpart did not. Physicians were less likely than their social work counterparts to identify patient/family problems related to adjustment to illness and problems connected to hospital and community resources as well. Social workers were much less satisfied with the collaboration, saw many more things that they or their collaborator could have done differently and even perceived more disagreement about the approach to the case than did their physician collaborators.

All five themes reflect the impact of these trends and give rise to ethical issues with practice implications.",The transplant experience of liver recipients: ethical issues and practice implications.,2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"The purpose of this paper is to describe the nature of social work services in a large public medical center serving an impoverished multicultural population. This monitoring evaluation was developed and conducted within the context of a research collaboration between a School of Social Work and a team of clinical workers, supervisors, and administrators from the social work department of the medical center. The paper includes a description of the development of the assessment instrument as well as the findings, including the categories of sociodemographics, assessments, and services delivered by medical social workers. Conclusions emphasize the degree of anxiety and depression in the patients and their families and the need for clinical social workers to be skilled in the multicultural assessment and treatment of these problems. This need is then put into the context of the current health care climate.",The nature of social work services in a large public medical center serving an impoverished multicultural population.,2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care,Outcomes of social work intervention in health care settings.,2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Behavioral medicine has become increasingly important in medical education over the past two decades, but adoption of its principles and methods has been slow. Behavioral medicine stresses the effects of human behavior on health and illness using a biopsychosocial approach. It also focuses on the use of the doctor-patient relationship, which, if developed using appropriate communication skills, can result in greater patient satisfaction and increased compliance. The authors surveyed all 124 American medical schools to assess both national trends and specific efforts in the teaching of behavioral medicine principles and methods. A review of the types of behavioral medicine programs offered reveals that eight percent of U.S. medical schools had integrated programs of behavioral medicine. Several successful and effective programs were identified, as were a number of specific curricular components. There are several options available to medical schools to integrate behavioral medicine into medical education. The authors conclude that medical education must include behavioral medicine in order to improve the health of the public and to meet the demands of a changing health care system.",Behavioral medicine in medical education: report of a survey.,2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care,"Social support, social networks, social cohesion and health.",2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Life care planning is a method of assessing future care needs and associated costs for the lifetime of individuals who have experienced catastrophic injury or have chronic health care needs.

Sixty-two healthy siblings aged 9 to 18 participated in the study. The children were asked to complete self-report questionnaires on state anxiety, loneliness, and self-control. The findings showed that the stress elicited emotional responses. Anxiety was related to the child's age and duration of the sibling's cancer, and loneliness was related to the child's sex and rank in the family. The outcomes also demonstrated a link between self-control as a coping skill and anxiety and loneliness as emotional distress responses. Healthy siblings' higher self-control rates were associated with their lower anxiety and loneliness reports. These findings support Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) theory on stress, appraisal, and coping. The results also highlight the need to train and impart children with learned resourcefulness in order to increase their self-control skills and improve their coping with and adjustment to siblings' serious illness.","Self-control, anxiety, and loneliness in siblings of children with cancer.",2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"The need for a cultural formulation in the healthcare setting is demonstrated.

Such issues have broad impact on older adults with intellectual deficits, their families, friends, roommates, and formal caregivers. As increasing numbers of people with a intellectual disability survive into old age, social workers regularly encounter end of life situations among very diverse individuals. Social workers in hospices, hospitals, and home care agencies are also asking how best to support people confronting the deaths of aging parents and family, housemates, friends, and staff, as well as their own terminal illnesses and dying. The history of care for people' with a disability documents their exclusion from supportive rituals and education about the end of life. Although existing systems of care continue to negatively impact people at the end of life, resources designed to assist people have expanded in the last decade. End of life education, grief counseling, bereavement services, support groups, crisis teams, and end of life committees are some of the strategies for providing more responsive end of life care.",Integrating end of life care into services for people with an intellectual disability.,2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Confronted with decreasing reimbursement and managed care, hospitals across the country have been &quot;reengineering&quot; in an effort to streamline processes and enhance revenue. Because of the financial implications of discharge planning, hospital social workers and their departments are typically examined and realigned in some way during a reengineering process. To survive in this environment, social workers must understand the principles of reengineering; its hoped for and actual impact; be able to identify opportunities to contribute; and have the capacity to cope with an evolving professional role. This paper presents a general overview of reengineering and its adaptation to the health care environment.

Patients with high levels of psychosocial stress make large demands on the primary care system and consume considerable laboratory and diagnostic treatment resources. Development of social services in primary care settings is a relatively new concept, however it has been clearly demonstrated that primary care physicians need the skills of social workers to handle the psychosocial and environmental aspects of illness. The principal goal was to demonstrate social work practice in a primary care health setting, utilizing practice research approaches. Validation of effectiveness was noted, as depression, anxiety, adjustment reactions (to name a few) were decreased, resulting in fewer physician visits, less somatization and improved compliance with medical and diet/nutrition regimens.

This paper considers the impact of an intervention aimed at encouraging patients to be more involved in their own transplant preparation. A social research design was used to explore the psychosocial impact of BMT. Qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used to survey 25 intervention-group and 229 comparison-group respondents. After controlling for identified confounding factors, comparisons were made between these groups. Contrary to expectation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups on the outcome measures. However, when matched for categorical confounding factors, the intervention group had statistically significant improvement on &quot;preparation,&quot; &quot;post-transplant problems&quot; and &quot;anxiety&quot; measures. The intervention group were also found to have higher scores on the &quot;helplessness&quot; and &quot;fatalism&quot; scales. The qualitative analyses suggest that this may have been due to a combination of raised expectations and non-encouraging hospital staff. Factors contributing to poor post-transplant adjustment were identified, as well as less problematic experiences common to the majority of transplant patients.",Psychological and social preparation for bone marrow transplantation.,2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Approximately half of the women who seek medical treatment for infertility never give birth to a child. Extended infertility treatment extracts a particularly devastating toll on female patients. The inability to bear children creates a developmental crisis for a woman, disrupting her identity, her relationships, and her sense of meaning. Infertility treatment tends to be delivered in an impersonal way, with little attention to the psychosocial needs of patients.

The reverse order of importance and somewhat different content of ethical dilemmas identified by the two groups reflect their differential position in the hierarchy of hospitals and the difference in their experience in dealing with ethical dilemmas vis-Ã -vis clients. The directors tended to depend more on internal loci of authority, and were far more concerned with how to interpret and apply the relevant laws than the direct practitioners. Their decision making patterns seemed to be more virtues focused in contrast to the utilitarian and rights based focus of the direct practitioners. The findings emphasize the need for social workers' knowledge of ethical theories, rules and principles, and ethical self-knowledge. They also point out the need for written protocols of debates and/or detailed descriptions of applications of ethical decision making models to case situations in practice. The latter may provide guidelines for social workers in similar situations in the future, and at the same time be used as material for teaching and supervision.",Ethical dilemmas in general hospitals: differential perceptions of direct practitioners and directors of social services.,2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Health care practitioners and researchers alike are beginning to acknowledge the importance of emotion in health.

At the same time, the anxiety level of post-CABG patients was higher than that measured in a community sample. Post-CABG high psychological distress (anxiety and mood states) and low functional capacity were associated with high levels of pessimism and ineffective emotion-focused coping strategies.

At times these diseases may be disclaimed by medical doctors and elusive to scientific categorization and description. In these cases sufferers may organize themselves together in support groups and lobby for money to finance the discovery of diagnostic markers that would legitimate and medicalize the constellation of symptoms that they experience. Chronic fatigue syndrome is such a disease; and it is characterized by varied and changing symptomatology. Its diagnostic markers are in the process of being refined. Presently, its diagnosis primarily originates in reports of subjective experience of extreme fatigue. Often-times people diagnose themselves after attending a support group and find a doctor through a support group network who believes in the disease. Sometimes, people then return to their own family doctors with information and try to teach their doctors about what they believe to be the nature of their disease, its prognosis and treatment. Through such paths as described in the paper, patients become &quot;experts&quot;: they may often know more about the illness than doctors and non-suffering others.

Overall, the respondents were very knowledgeable about the major modes of transmission, but they still had misconceptions about the likelihood of transmission through casual contact. Prevention programs aimed at African Americans age 55 years and older should focus on dispelling misconceptions about the transmission of HIV through casual contact, and enhancing their knowledge about the effectiveness of condoms in preventing the spread of AIDS.","HIV risk factors, HIV antibody testing, and AIDS knowledge among African Americans age 55 years and older.",2000,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care,A &quot;society for all ages&quot;: saving Social Security and Medicare.,2000,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"In an exploratory study of family support services in Massachusetts, three focus groups were convened to obtain the perspectives of parents caring for individuals with developmental disabilities and living at home.

Today, social workers in oncology need to be current with research in order to integrate empirical and practical knowledge. In an effort to assist in this process, we reviewed empirical studies to address the following questions: (1) When are patients likely to be willing to accept help? (2) Is there sufficient evidence to show that some types of psychosocial treatment are effective in improving psychological or physical functioning? (3) Are certain treatments preferable for some cancer patients depending on the type of cancer and stage of disease? Using a vote-count review of 40 intervention studies in psychosocial oncology, 36 documented some positive outcomes from treatments, 4 studies exhibited null findings, and no studies were found to have clearly negative results. Studies revealed the most positive results from interventions during the treatment phase, next from interventions at diagnosis, and lastly from interventions during the terminal stage. Individual and group formats showed a comparable level of efficacy. Interventions that included cognitive behavioral methods had the most consistently positive results. Those intervention studies where social workers were involved in the research were less successful at demonstrating efficacy. This difference was due primarily to the fact that social workers often did not include cognitive behavioral interventions in their research.

Subjects were asked to respond to whether they felt the loss of the &quot;safety net&quot; of treatment had caused them any type of distress. The narrative responses of the subjects support the notion that the period after treatment ceases may be viewed as a crisis that brings with it anxiety and uncertainty. The results of this study reinforce the need for additional research to better understand the issue so that services and programs can be enhanced to better meet patients' needs.

On day seven, the same rater recorded the optimal discharge plan for each resource category and those impediment codes that were likely to interfere with attaining the desired resource. On discharge, the rater recorded the actual resources obtained for the patient, and if the plan did not meet the patient's needs, an impediment code was used to explain why the sub-optimal &quot;discharge fit&quot; was not secured.RESULTS: Having an impediment in any of the three resource categories (housing, daily activities, psychiatric treatment services) at day 7 was predictive of a sub-optimal discharge plan. Of all three resource categories studied, a decline in overall impediments from day 7 to discharge was significant only for psychiatric treatment services. An internal/clinical impediment in any of the three resource categories on day 7 was associated with a patient history of alcohol and drug abuse. A significant association was found between having external/environmental impediments identified at discharge for housing and psychiatric treatment services with return to the hospital within 90 days of discharge.CONCLUSION: Study of the impediments to the discharge planning effort provides an opportunity to elucidate the factors that comprise the pathway of recovery from psychiatric illness, but which are normally ill-defined, poorly understood, or not readily measured.",Impediments to the discharge planning effort for psychiatric inpatients.,1999,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Making an informed decision about whether to take hormone replacement therapy to offset short- and/or long-range effects of decreased estrogen due to menopause is particularly important because of the health-related risks and benefits associated with hormone replacements.

Therefore, social workers in oncology must be current with empirical research. In an effort to integrate current research into social work practice, we reviewed empirical studies with sound research designs to answer the following questions: (1) What portion of cancer patients are likely to need social work services? (2) What types of services do social workers provide to meet these needs? and (3) Who is likely to be (or not to be) the recipient of these services. Does intervention research include diverse (non-traditional, non-white and non-middle class) clients? The results show about one third of patients will be judged at high-risk for psychosocial problems but that only 15-25% of those who are diagnosed with cancer will eventually use psychosocial oncology services. Some have mainly instrumental, concrete needs, and others will use psychosocial counseling.

The beauty of shifting to a flattened hierarchy that is patient focused, is that it endorses change consistent with the social work mission in health. The challenge for social work is to grapple with the big issues: our belief in ourselves; defining our roles and functions and priorities; defining our vision in programmatic hospital organizations; being critical of what we do; and articulating what we have to offer.

These behaviors include frequent experimentation with alcohol and other drugs before sex, sexual activity with different partners, and inconsistent safe-sex practices. The combination of these risky behaviors causes increased concern about the spread of HIV among this age group. The study discussed in this article examined the relationship between substance use during adolescence and HIV risk behavior among young adults ages 19 to 21 with and without a college education. Results indicated that increased use of alcohol and marijuana at younger ages is related to riskier sexual activity and increased use of alcohol and marijuana as young adults. Recommendations for interventions are made.A mailed survey was conducted to assess the risky sexual behavior and substance abuse among an initial sample of 2071 young adults in Lexington, Kentucky, during the 1987-88 school year. The survey included specific items about peer relations, family attachment, self-esteem, sensation seeking, friends' drug use, impulsivity, physical health, health and mental health utilization, dieting, delinquency, violence, and risky sexual behavior. A total of 952 (400 males and 552 females) respondents were included in the final analysis. The findings indicate that earlier initiation of sexual activity is related to early involvement with drugs. Furthermore, male participants who used alcohol or marijuana at a younger age engaged in riskier sexual behavior than female participants. Female participants were more likely to use condoms regardless of their early substance use patterns; and those who had never experienced sex or who initiated sex later (ages 19 or 20) were less likely to report lifetime or current drug use. This study indicated that there is a relationship between the early occurrence of substance use and riskier sexual behavior.

A total of 128 social workers were administered a questionnaire that included three scales: an involvement scale, a job satisfaction measure, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Greater involvement was related significantly to higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Overall, results suggest that social workers are affected negatively by this type of work.

The author argues that for managed behavioral health organizations to serve disabled customers adequately, community support is required. Ten field-tested reasons to include community support services in every behavioral health plan are presented. The author concludes that social workers are uniquely qualified to adapt proven interventions from model community support programs to the mission of managed behavioral health organizations, with the potential to remedy problems of access, continuity, and accountability in providing treatment for serious and persistent mental illness.","Managed care, meet community support: ten reasons to include direct support services in every behavioral health plan.",1999,UNITED STATES,Health Soc WorkMany individuals with serious mental illnesses have co-occurring drug and alcohol problems.

However, little is known about whether drug users act on these referrals. The study discussed in this article examined the level of exposure to street outreach reported by injection drug users, the most common medical referrals acted on as a result of such contacts, and the predictors of acting on these referrals. Findings indicate that injection drug users with four or more contacts with street outreach workers during the preceding six months were more likely to report acting on referrals.

Each group is driven by different motivations to write. Academics seek a 'scientific rationality' for the field, while practitioners assume practical and intuitive reasoning, experience aligned with theory, and the 'art of practice' to guide them. It has been said that practitioners do not write and that 'faculty' are the trustees of the knowledge base of the profession, and are responsible for its promulgation via publication. Practitioners, however, do write about their practice and their programs, and analyze both, but publish much of their work in non-social work media. Their work tends not to be referenced by academic writers. One department's social workers' publications are described. We learn, from their practice writings, what concerns clinicians. Theirs is case-based learning, theoretically supported, in which the organization of services calls for their participation in multi-professional decision-making. There is the growing realization among social workers that practice wisdom and scientific technologies need to be reassessed together to find ways to enhance social work services. Clinicians' knowledge can lead to continuing refinement of practice and enhanced institutional services. If practitioners' writings can be assessed, they may lead to a written practice knowledge base, subject to timely change. Academic and practitioner separateness hampers progress in the field.

Two hundred family/children and psychiatric workers of seven social service organizations were surveyed. Instruments used were the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and the Staff Burnout Scale for Health Professionals. Reported levels of job satisfaction and burnout are within normal limits. Psychiatric and family/children workers report equal job satisfaction levels, but the latter group reports significantly higher burnout levels. Both groups are particularly satisfied with the amount of praise delivered by supervisors and are reportedly dissatisfied with salary levels and promotional opportunities. These three factors are strongly associated with job satisfaction and burnout levels of both groups. Findings have practical implications for social service administrators and practitioners.

Although no statistically significant differences were found between the three groups with respect to many indicators of financial well-being, each of the groups reported that their financial well-being had been adversely affected by managed care organization guidelines. Because the social workers in this study were found to spend a greater percentage of their time in private practice than psychologists and psychiatrists, managed care organizations' policies with respect to financial reimbursement are likely to impact them more adversely than professionals in other disciplines. Other changes in overhead costs, including office staffing, record keeping and malpractice insurance, as required by managed care organizations, were considered by many of the respondents to be among the most prominent issues affecting their financial well-being.",Managed care's impact on the financial well-being of social workers in private practice.,1998,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health CareThe noise surrounding managed care is deafening.

At the same time, due to advances in medicine, greater emphasis has been placed on an individual's genetic origins. This trend places individuals who have no access to information on their genetic origins in a vulnerable position. Because of the secrecy and anonymity that has surrounded donor inseminations, many individuals who were so conceived are irreversibly cut off from any possible contact with or even knowledge about their genetic fathers, who will also never have the opportunity to meet their offspring. In view of the accumulated evidence concerning the detrimental effect of secrecy, anonymity and deception in donor insemination, this paper argues that these practices are not only psychologically and socially harmful but also ethically unacceptable.","Secrecy, anonymity, and deception in donor insemination: a genetic, psycho-social and ethical critique.",1998,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Responding to mainstream ideals of female beauty, many women and girls view thinness as a requirement for feeling acceptable to themselves and to others. The drive to be thin can lead to problematic eating patterns, such as self-starvation, binge-eating, and purging, symptoms of the eating disorders, anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Most current literature on eating disorders and the drive for thinness focuses only on White middle-class women and girls. African American females have been largely excluded from studies, due to the assumption that the Black community's acceptance of women with fuller shapes protects its women from eating problems. However, recent studies are beginning to show that race, class, and exposure to a dominant culture which denigrates Black features and physiques impact body image among Black women and may play a role in the development of eating problems.",Eating disorders and the cultural forces behind the drive for thinness: are African American women really protected?,1998,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"This study examined the effects of stress, social support, and health status on distress in a sample of 79 persons with AIDS in New Jersey. The study used New Jersey's AIDS Registry as a geographically based list sampling frame, with data gathered through in-person interviews. The study examined the effects of health status (operationalized as symptom burden), stress (operationalized with a stressful-life-events scale), social support from friends, and social support from family on depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. We examined the differential effects of friend support and of family support at differing levels of stressful life events. Results indicate that health status and stressful life events both have substantial impact on distress. Friend support reduced distress under lower-stress conditions, while family support reduced distress under high-stress conditions. These results suggest that social support from peers is critical for emotional well-being of persons with HIV in many circumstances, but that in periods of crisis family support becomes a more important determinant of emotional well-being.","Stress, social support, and distress in a statewide population of persons with AIDS in New Jersey.",1998,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Black women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than white women but more likely to be adversely affected.

Respondents were 80 wife caregivers of frail older (age 55+) veterans at a Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in a Midwestern state. Most caregivers agreed that it is acceptable to get help with the physical care of the husband and to get help themselves for the emotional strains caused by caregiving. Acceptability of a wife's getting help with the physical care of her husband was a positive predictor of number of services ever used and frequency of in-home service use.

Such coordination is required because of the progressively debilitating nature of this chronic disease and the fragmented health care and social services delivery system. One of the major problems with the study of case management is the difficulty in actually measuring it. Another major limitation has been the focus almost exclusively on adult models of HIV/AIDS case management. This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of a time study methodology to measure differences in case management activities when case managers work with families and when they work with individuals. Ten case managers from two urban hospital pediatric and adult HIV/AIDS clinics and 10 case managers from 3 community organizations participated. Case management activity was sampled using a beeper carried by case managers which signaled randomly 8 times a day over 5 consecutive days. When the signal &quot;beeped&quot;, case managers checked off on a 1-page form the appropriate descriptor of their involvement concerning task initiation, interaction, location, type, function as well as information about client needs, HIV status, and family history.

Aside from the practical skills necessary for engaging diverse groups, it requires an understanding of the complex interplay of several theoretical constructs. Using an eight-year breast cancer prevention project, the North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program, as a case study, this article describes both the &quot;science and art&quot; of community health promotion. The article provides examples illustrating the &quot;art&quot; of generating participation by both lay and professional communities and concludes with guidelines for social workers who plan to conduct their own community health promotion programs.","Promoting breast cancer screening in rural, African American communities: the &quot;science and art&quot; of community health promotion.",1998,United States,Health Soc Work"AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors were assessed in female Mexican migrant laborers. Thirty-two women were administered a modified version of the Hispanic Condom Questionnaire. Respondents were knowledgeable about the major modes of HIV transmission, but one-third to one-half of the women believed that they could contract AIDS from unlikely casual sources. Although respondents reported few negative beliefs about condom use, actual condom use with sex partners was low and knowledge of proper condom use was problematic. Consequently, 75 percent reported never carrying condoms. Implications of these findings for future research and provision of services for female Mexican migrants are discussed.According to US Department of Health and Human Services data for 1990, there are approximately 4.1 million migrant workers in the US, mainly of Mexican background. Half of all Mexican immigrants over the past 2 decades have been women. Findings are presented from a December 1992 assessment of AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among a sample of female Mexican migrant laborers in Jalisco, Mexico, a small agricultural sending community 210 km from Guadalajara. The 32 women administered a modified version of the Hispanic Condom Questionnaire were of mean age 34.2 years and had lived and worked in the US since 1982. Women currently living in the US were visiting Jalisco for the Christmas holiday. Although the surveyed women were knowledgeable about the major modes of HIV transmission, 33-50% believed that they could contract AIDS from unlikely casual sources. Respondents reported few negative beliefs about condom use, but actual condom use with sex partners was low and knowledge of proper condom use was inadequate. 42% reported ever using a condom and 75% reported almost never carrying condoms.

These donors feel overwhelming responsibility for their siblings' survival, which can lead to psychological distress. The donors are engaged in age-appropriate medical play and are encouraged to discuss their feelings and concerns about their role. After the marrow harvest, donors receive a certificate, and either they or their parents evaluate the program. Thus far, 97.5% have rated the program very helpful. These evaluations suggest that the program has a very positive effect on the sibling donor's psychosocial health.

The study involved the completion of a series of questionnaires and client interviews over a three month period. A combination of content and statistical analysis was used to interpret the findings. Eighty-eight percent of clients contacted indicated satisfaction with the social work service received. The results indicated a positive match between clients' and social workers' perceptions of the intervention, and affirmed the role of social work in bereavement care. Seventy percent of clients made recommendations regarding potential improvements to social work services. These recommendations contained four specific suggestions: that social workers be present when the doctor breaks bad news; that additional support be provided in how to talk to doctors; that social workers be involved from the point of admission of the patient; and that a primary social worker remain with the family throughout the hospital stay.",Perceptions of social work intervention with bereaved clients: some implications for hospital social work practice.,1998,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"The Multiple Stressor Debriefing (MSD) model was used to debrief 112 American Red Cross workers individually or in groups after their participation in the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake relief effort.

The sample for this study consists of 1,685 Hispanics age 65 and older, representing four ethnic groups: Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and other Hispanics. Ethnic comparisons based on personal characteristics, poverty status and IADL found there were differences among the groups analyzed in terms of marital status, language, religion, age, education, poverty, and IADL. Logistic regression findings revealed that elderly Hispanics who were married, bilingual, and had higher educational achievement were more likely to live above the poverty level than were their counterparts. Findings from an ordinary least squares regression analysis revealed that poor elderly Hispanics had more IADL problems; that men had more IADL problems than women; that IADL problems tended to increase with age; that more educated people had fewer IADL problems; that Cubans had fewer IADL problems than other Hispanics; and that Puerto Ricans had more IADL problems than all other Hispanics.

In terms of choices at the end of life, assisted suicide has begun to come out of the closet, so to speak, and as a result, the National Association of Social Worker's adopted a policy in 1993 which addresses this end of life option. Oregon passed Ballot Measure 16 in November of 1994 which allows for a terminally ill person to request drugs to end life. As the legalities of assisted suicide are decided by judges and courts, some terminally ill people will think about and decide to take their own lives rather than wait for the disease process to come to its own ending. There are very few practice guidelines available to social workers who work with the suicidal terminally ill.

In this paper we explore these meanings as expressed in the attitudes about do-not-resuscitate orders of three groups: university students in a health-related discipline of social work, university students in a non-health related discipline, and persons over the age of sixty. Findings from analysis of the three groups suggest a strong interest in issues surrounding resuscitation. Social and nonmedical factors are important in the decision to resuscitate and therefore should be given careful consideration. Next to their spouse, respondents named their physician as the person they most wanted to talk with about withholding resuscitation. Yet, studies of physicians cited earlier indicate many physicians are hesitant to discuss end of life decisions with their patients.

Southeast Asians are the most recent of Asian groups to come to the U.S., and have done so following an immigration and refugee experience that was among the most traumatic in recent memory resulting in significant levels of psychosocial distress. The combined influences of mental health disorders, which frequently co-occur with substance abuse, and acculturation pressures suggest that a significant increase in substance abuse problems may be in progress for Southeast Asian immigrants. Preliminary evidence appears to bear out this hypothesis.

These facts have increased the pressure for planning effective short-term therapeutic methods that will assist the patient's return to family and community life. This situation led the social workers in the internal medicine units to initiate one-session group meetings for patients and families that would provide a response to the distress of primary caregivers and increase access to social work intervention of families with discharge needs. A model of single-sessions intervention, which had been experienced for the first time in the Sheba Medical Center at Tel-Hashomer, will be presented and evaluated. The presented intervention enabled to reduce anxiety and increase the capabilities of family members to organize and cope with the situation.

Most of the women had never married, with virgins and adolescent mothers the least likely to be in marital relationships. Relative to the other subgroups, virgins reported higher educational, financial, and occupational achievement.

Little research has explored this dual challenge. The authors conducted semistructured one-hour interviews with HIV-positive women that focused on the impact of the HIV diagnosis on the women's lives. Significant factors emerging from the interviews included the impact of stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, disbelief of the diagnosis, the lack of a guardian for their children, the paucity of women's support groups, and barriers associated with seeking services.

To examine this issue, a secondary analysis was conducted using an existing data set that included a sample of 109 women. Although intensity of referral was not related to entry into or relapse during treatment, high-intensity referral was associated with completion of treatment.

The purpose of this study was to examine gender and health among five age groups of African Americans. A sample of 1,174 respondents age 24 to 85 was selected from the 1986 Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) Study. Regression analysis was performed using a hierarchical model to examine age and gender on five dimensions of health: functional health, chronic conditions, satisfaction with health, self-ratings of health, and activities of daily living (ADL) limitations controlling for age, education, income, and marital status among five age groups of African Americans. Results revealed that in the 24-39 age group, men had fewer chronic conditions and less ADL limitations, yet rated their health poorer than their female counterparts. In the 75 and over age group men had better functional health yet were less satisfied with their health than women. Control variables were significantly related to objective and subjective dimensions of health especially among the younger age groups.

The majority of shelters also offered mental health services and medical care. Most mental health services were provided in-house but less than half of the shelters provided medical care in-house. Other shelters referred residents to health care sites in the community. Shelters that relied on staff from other community agencies, the most common arrangement, to provide medical care in-house allocated the least amount of overall time to health services.

We find that organizational factors and the preferences of constituents are the strongest determinants of departmental priorities, with leader attributes playing a less influential role. An interesting discovery is that each factor's influence varies depending on the nature of the priority area. We conclude that all three explanations for how performance priorities are shaped-a political model, a leader influence model and an institutional model-find support.

A total of 125 newly diagnosed NPC patients were interviewed in the diagnostic phase, the number dropping to 119 in the treatment phase, and 111 in the post-treatment phase. Data were gathered by a pre-tested structured measuring instrument via face-to-face interviews. Those patients with poor adjustment in each phase of the illness were found to have higher perceived stress; they tended to interpret their illness as more threatening and less controllable, and they employed problem-focused coping less frequently but used emotion-focused coping more frequently. The health locus of control and the overall perceived social support had differential effects on short-term adjustment in different phases of the illness. Current stress was identified to be the most important factor accounting for patients' adjustment in the treatment phase, while adjustment in the post-treatment phase was predominantly accounted for by previous adjustment.

In order to combat this problem, the Israeli government, in 1988, created the National Anti-Drug Authority, a government agency whose responsibilities include the coordination of all prevention, treatment, and research activities that are directed towards the goal of fighting the war against drugs. As part of its mandate, the National Anti-Drug Authority created local anti-drug authority coordinators to fulfill its goals. The study described in this paper presents a preliminary picture of the role profile of the anti-drug authority coordinator worker in Israel. Five major direct practice role categories were revealed in the study with the community assessment and social broker role identified as the most active practice component followed by the community coordinator role, supervision and consultation, planning and conducting anti-drug prevention services, and assisting in community intervention the least active role component. In order to understand the findings, the role categories are classified according to their frequency of practice by the anti-drug coordinators along with the goals, focal systems, and the major tasks toward which each role category is directed.

However, social workers and physicians were more likely than nurses to consider such factors as cost-benefit ratios, quality of life, relative strength of a patient's moral claim, and scarcity of resources in rationing decisions.

Acculturation problems were anticipated, due to cultural, demographic and religious differences. Participant observations and open-ended interviews supplied the raw data. Emphasis was placed on the factors and processes definable as typically American: voluntarism and pragmatism, personal sharing as a basis for relationships, spiritual rather than religious faith, the idea of a &quot;personal God&quot; guiding individuals, faith in God without religious tradition and formal ritualism. The results showed that, for the substance-dependents, the issue is generally irrelevant, and they accepted most &quot;American&quot; components of the program unquestioningly. However, two discrete features of Christian ideology required conscious incorporation by NA's Israeli members: (1) the concept of a &quot;Loving God&quot; who is non-punitive, which for many members was opposed to their traditions and upbringing, and (2) kneeling to pray, a recommendation which many members initially found problematic. The conclusion denotes a factor facilitating the transfer of therapeutic programs from one culture to another--that of personal suffering as a universal domain.

Many of these persons have no family and no obvious place to go. Community supports to assist people outside the hospitals are not provided at a level commensurate with the need. The result is inadequate housing, social isolation, non-existent care and, in too many cases, reinstitutionalization and/or preventable deaths. This paper describes the process by which vulnerable adults wind up in unsuitable community settings, as a result of ill-conceived deinstitutionalization in the province of Ontario. It places a particular focus on the difficult role played by the discharge planner as conduit from hospital to community. The planner is often caught in the middle, facing hospital (and physician) directives to empty beds precipitously, alongside an acute shortage of suitable housing in the community. Departing patients are often sent to settings that lack any form of governmental inspection, regulation, licensure, or control: they are at the mercy of often indifferent and, at times, overtly rapacious landlords who may take the welfare cheque and give little in return.

Its aims were (1) to obtain the views of hospital social workers and their managers about the effect of implementing the NHS (National Health Service) and Community Care Act of 1990 and policies for Care in the Community on the practice of social work and (2) to elicit issues of concern to form the basis of a national study. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in hospital social work departments which were providing a service to adults with health needs. Interviews with a representative sample of 85 workers and 36 managers (including Assistant Directors and Principal Training Officers) in 11 hospitals were held between June-December 1993, three months after the introduction of the policies. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed. A questionnaire provided some quantitative data, and additional information was obtained through non-participant observation at team meetings. The interviews covered four topic areas: the nature of social work in hospitals; the changes introduced by implementing the legislation; the management of that change; and the effect of the new policies on practice. Results show an increase in the volume of referrals particularly in assessment for nursing home care; and an overwhelming amount of administrative work to process the new procedures for providing community care. Most relates to filling in forms, duplication of assessments and repetitive bureaucracy. Workers struggle to meet their expectation of professional practice with organisational demands. The discussion centres on three issues raised by practitioners; the changing nature of social work due to the alternative models of service being imposed by local authorities; the lack of consultation and involvement by management of the frontline workers in the management of this change; the dissonance felt by hardworking and committed practitioners to whom the increasing paper work is yet another obstacle to user involvement. This may have clear implications for management, for the degree of stress and perceived pressure resulting from these organisational changes is counterproductive to job satisfaction.

The relevant topics under the general category of adequacy are (1) the perception and definition of the citizen/client; (2) the concept of rationality in health planning broken down into conditionality and prioritization, and (3) the concept of adequacy itself. Each will be addressed from the standpoint of recent experience and what may be done in the future to clarify and rationalize each. Clarity about clients, about rational approaches to policy making and planning, leading to a clear idea about adequacy in health care are presented as the indispensable elements in social work.

The implications of an adolescent's decision to have a baby have health, social and economic consequences for the adolescent, her offspring, partner and family and for all of society. This article will discuss the health, social and developmental consequences of adolescent childbearing and provide an overview of social work practice with childbearing adolescents.Hospital social workers who work with pregnant adolescents are in a key position to facilitate positive parenting outcomes even before delivery. The adolescent's decision to complete a pregnancy has vast health, social, and economic implications for the teen mother, her child, her partner, her family, and US society. In many cases, the tasks of pregnancy and parenting are diametrically opposed to the developmental tasks of adolescence: emergence of an autonomous identity, independence from family, and peer acceptance. Social workers must make a comprehensive assessment of the pregnant adolescent's strengths, needs, and developmental stage. Social work functions include clinical case management, family system interventions, outreach to the father, facilitation of peer group support, and individual psychotherapy. Although early childbearing may place a teenager and her child at a social disadvantage, there are an increasing number of studies attesting that adolescents can overcome these disadvantages.

We also looked for racial differences in ruling out nursing home care for reasons of patient and family preference. Discharge planning with African American patients and family members involved less pursuit of nursing home care and more pursuit of formal services in the home than planning with white patients and families. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.",Racial differences in discharge planning.,1996,United States,Health Soc Work"This study addressed two research questions: What are medical social workers' attitudes toward the management of chronic pain, and how knowledgeable are they about chronic pain? Findings indicate that social workers hold a highly positive orientation toward both nonmedical treatment of chronic pain and social work involvement in chronic pain services, but they display low levels of knowledge about chronic pain and pain management. Together these findings suggest that social workers possess the willingness and opportunity to develop a social work specialization in pain management but may be hindered by an uncertain knowledge base in the area.",Attitudes toward and knowledge of chronic pain: a survey of medical social workers.,1996,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"Client self-determination is the key element of NASW's policy statement about social work intervention in end-of-life decisions.

This article discusses the critical problem of low rates of immunization for this population and identifies ways social workers can play an active role in ensuring that more children are immunized. Immunization of preschool children is a function of the interrelationship among health-seeking behavior of parents, financial and nonfinancial barriers to health care, and provider practices that inhibit appropriate immunization. Improving access to existing public programs, facilitating community organization efforts, assisting communities through self-help and mutual-aid initiatives, and supporting national efforts can improve immunization status among poor children.",Immunization among African American children: implications for social work.,1996,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"Discharge planning is a major concern of hospitals as they seek to reduce costs associated with prolonged lengths of hospital stays, prevent subsequent readmissions, and ensure that discharge dispositions are appropriate. This process can be even more complicated when the patient is suffering from dementia and the family has primary responsibility for the discharge outcome. Data on the discharge process and caregiver satisfaction with it were collected from 179 caregivers of hospitalized dementia patients. The findings indicate that social workers are important influences in the discharge decisions but are significantly more influential when the discharge is to a nursing home.

The sample was composed largely of youths of homosexual or bisexual orientation who were substance abusers, prostitutes, or both. The data suggest that although community-based education efforts may be associated with lower-risk behavior among this population, the overall risk profiles of these socially marginalized youths remained high. Inferences are drawn about the cofactors of risk that must be addressed and the education needed to enhance the health prospects of these youths.This article opens with a review of the literature on research on HIV risk among adolescents in the US, which is organized into the following topics: adolescents and social contexts, social marginalization, sexual orientation, and developmental factors. The article then presents results of an exploratory study of HIV knowledge and risk behaviors found in 60 teenagers and young men 13-29 years old who were part of the street culture in Hollywood, California. Potential participants were included in the sample if they exhibited any combination of the following risk factors: unstable housing, involvement with illicit drugs, engagement in prostitution, or identification as gay or bisexual. Data were collected through 20-minute long structured interviews. It was found that 60% were White, 30% Black, 5% Hispanic, and 5% other; 90% were gay or bisexual; 80% were not traditionally employed; 25% were registered in school; 44% had no stable housing arrangement; and 57% used drugs. While 76% could identify a correct source of HIV infection, 75% of these also mentioned an incorrect source. Means of prevention mentioned were condom use (82%), not sharing needles (42%), and reducing the number of sexual partners (13%), but this knowledge did not translate into safe behavior (19% shared needles, 53% had intercourse without a condom, and 67% had multiple sex partners). Consistent condom use was reported by only 20%, 7% were celibate, and 63% had not undergone HIV testing. It was concluded that youth living at this level of marginalization are at very high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and are unlikely to be served by available health promotion strategies.

Results indicated that those men who participated in support groups on a long-term basis (i.e., one year or more) were less likely to have access to other social support networks. They were also most interested in receiving and exchanging emotionally-oriented forms of support, such as empathy, acceptance and camaraderie. By contrast, the men who participated in support groups for a brief period of time (i.e., six months or less) had greater access to alternative support networks and were more interested in receiving and exchanging instrumental forms of support, such as illness-related information and examples of effective coping. Those men who elected not to participate in support groups emphasized their relatively good health, the strength of their existing support systems and their reluctance to see others with life-threatening symptoms. Finally, regardless of whether and how they participated in formal support groups, the majority of men in this study benefitted from interacting regularly with peers. Through these interactions, they received helpful understanding, information and friendship. In addition to this, they often experienced a revitalizing sense of purpose, efficacy and mutuality which enabled them to cope more successfully with their illness.","Searching for information, understanding, and self-value: the utilization of peer support groups by gay men with HIV/AIDS.",1996,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"This article reports the findings and implications of a study in which the effect of the AIDS diagnosis, alone and in interaction with a client's race, gender and sexual orientation, on social workers' clinical assessments was determined.

Several hypotheses emerged from this focus group that were then formally tested with a questionnaire. The results of the questionnaire identified (a) predictors of attitudes toward advance directives and (b) predictors of the act of having established a directive. Based upon the findings from the focus group and the questionnaire, recommendations for social workers raising the issue of advance directives can be made. First, time for the client to adjust to seropositive notification should be allowed prior to raising the advance directive issue. Second, the advance directive issue should be raised in the context of empowerment rather than being embedded in other paper work. Third, people who are most likely to be disturbed by the process of establishing advance directives are those who have low health locus of control, low trait optimism, low reliance on active involvement as a coping mechanism, and low reliance on distraction as a coping mechanism.

Although African American patients were more impaired than the white patients, the original plan of the caregivers was to take the patients home while the white caregivers were originally undecided. For both groups, greater cognitive impairment increases the likelihood of institutional placement.

Results reveal that the cluster AIDS unit, where a specialized AIDS social work staff works in collaboration with the interdisciplinary AIDS team, is associated with a significant reduction in hospital length of stay for persons with HIV disease and complex discharge planning needs. These results support the hypothesis that discharge planning services, performed by specialized social workers, are a cost effective investment for hospitals treating patients with complex chronic conditions, such as AIDS. Further research should be developed to systematically evaluate the cost effectiveness of hospital-based social workers, using prospective experimental designs, in order to establish the net impact of social work discharge planning services on patient and family outcomes and institutional and social costs.",An economic analysis of two models of hospital care for AIDS patients: implications for hospital discharge planning.,1996,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Pediatric AIDS is a continuing problem because of maternal transmission. Medical management is often complicated by the loss of one or both parents and adverse home environments. This study explores the cost of inpatient and clinic care of children admitted with AIDS in 1988 or 1989 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, and also examines the social severity of the cases. Blue Shield allowances were used to price clinic visits and tests, and prices in a drug trade publication were used to determine medication costs. Inpatient costs calculated per person-month at risk amounted to $48,000 per year. Costs per person-month of the clinic care averaged $461 (38% of which was for drugs), annualized to around $5,500. These costs are higher than those shown by previous studies. A few cases requiring intensive inpatient services accounted for a large percentage of costs. The social severity analysis, based on the family environment at first admission and later, revealed that households were often stressed by chronic illnesses, drug abuse, marital problems and poor residential quality. Given the circumstances in which pediatric AIDS develops, the activities of social workers to strengthen families are essential to facilitating compliance, maintaining health and minimizing use of the hospital.",Pediatric AIDS at Mount Sinai Medical Center 1988-89: a study of costs and social severity.,1996,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Hospital social workers were asked to describe their roles and functions, with particular emphasis on the amount of time spent doing traditional advocacy on behalf of patients. The results indicated that workers spent the least amount of time on advocacy as compared with other traditional social work roles.

This paper examines clients' assessments of social work services received in the acute care hospital setting. It is based on interviews with 120 discharged hospital social work clients, and investigates their definition of their psychosocial problems, their expectations from the social work department and their appraisal of the outcomes of the social work intervention. Main findings include the dominance of instrumental needs among the psychosocial problems cited by clients, while emotional relief was the most prevalent outcome. A general lack of clarity regarding expectations was observed. The findings are discussed in light of organizational and methodological issues which might influence the examination of clients' assessments.",Clients' views of social work services in the hospital setting in Israel.,1996,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"The social work department of a large New York City teaching hospital has conducted practice research studies over the past five years to better improve the early identification of high risk elderly patients. A recent prospective study is presented of the relationship between functional capacity and discharge status/length of stay, the results of which directly led to a change in the inpatient delivery system. A sample of 250 randomly selected patients, 65 years or older, selected upon admission, were tested using the Katz ADL, the IADL and the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (PMSQ) to distinguish those patients likely to remain hospitalized beyond medical necessity. Results of a logistic regression indicate that low functional capacity patients (IADL: Wald = 5.6; P &lt; .02) were likely to remain beyond medical necessity. The model predicted group membership correctly 90.6% of the time.

Many people are not aware of available social services. Families with serious social problems are not finding the help they need. The aim of this study was to develop and refine a questionnaire as a screening tool to identify elderly outpatients in primary care settings who are at high risk for psychological, social or environmental needs. This study identified those ten factors at each site which were most indicative that further intervention was needed. There were consistencies among the coordinators across sites in terms of what factors triggered intervention.

The original problem underlying the study is the long-term decline in the percentage of total corporate contributions to health and human services. A questionnaire, mailed in May of 1993, was used to investigate the impact of strategic philanthropy on the relationship between corporations and health/human service organizations. Corporations strategically prioritizing their philanthropic support were expected to create new opportunities for partnerships between business and health/human service agencies. The survey resulted in a sample of 226 corporations. The results showed statistically significant support for the hypothesis that highly strategic philanthropy programs will be more likely to enter into a health/human service partnership than less strategic programs. The multiple regression analysis method was used to control for the effects of corporate size, industry type, the (corporate) contributions management organization, and United Way credibility.

Of the $6 billion donated by corporations to charity in 1994, approximately one-fourth came through corporate foundations. What determines the choice of giving through a foundation or directly to charity? The author examines the financial implications for each type of corporate giving by presenting specific elements of current policy on tax rates and deductions for giving. Specific factors considered are (1) differences in the treatment of corporate and foundation income, (2) deductibility of different types of gifts, (3) occurrence of donations to non-U.S. (non-tax-deductible) charities, (4) sales of assets to fund corporate foundations, (5) effects of giving on corporate image, and (6) effects of contributions over time. Analysis of regulations illustrates motivating factors for why corporate executives make certain types of gifts in certain ways.

Nonprofit agencies have been characterized as being controlled by powerful government agencies that dictate the terms and conditions of contracts, the types of services to be provided, the methods of delivery, and the price to be paid for services. One would expect to find nonprofits anxious to terminate their relationships with various units of government, and return to a more independent status. That is not happening. If anything, purchase of service contracting (POSC) with nonprofit agencies is increasing.

Results indicate that power perceptions are significantly associated with an array of perceived service outcomes.

Various reviews of the impact of these models suggest that they have not lived up to their expectations and have had little or no impact on broad system indicators of service delivery. Foremost among the findings of existing studies is that these models have not been implemented and used as intended. The risk assessment field has not taken advantage of theoretical principles suggested by the organizational change literature.

This scale has two subscales, one that assesses the extent to which a caregiver's basic human needs are being met and one that assesses the extent to which a caregiver can satisfactorily meet his or her predictable activities of daily living. Developed from a model that focuses on a person's strengths, this tool was created to help social work practitioners enable caregivers to become more in touch with their own abilities.

A sample of 76 adults ages 25 to 40 was drawn from the membership of a church. No subjects were preidentified as being ACAs. Subjects completed an 89-item questionnaire that included four standardized instruments. ACAs were found to be experiencing significantly less intimacy in their closest current relationship than ACNAs. Significant associations were found among the major variables of intimacy, loneliness, and openness to feelings, although correlations were much stronger for ACNAs, suggesting different relationships among the variables for the two groups. Models for the prediction of intimacy and loneliness were constructed in which a significant amount of the variance for both variables was predicted.","Intimacy, loneliness, and openness to feelings in adult children of alcoholics.",1995,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"The incidence of heart disease is disproportionately large among the Hawaiian population.

Data used in the analysis were taken from the Geriatric Nurse Practitioner Project in which residents were interviewed within one month of admission. Three scales were used to measure initial reaction: participation in nursing home activities, satisfaction with services, and social interaction. Covariates used to control for differences between groups were age, activities of daily living score, cognitive score, and affective status score. Bivariate relationships were found between the independent variables, deciding to move and wanting to move, and two measures, satisfaction with services and participation in nursing home activities.

A telephone follow-up study of patients discharged from an urban teaching hospital in 1990 was undertaken to determine the extent to which discharge plans for home services were carried out and to identify factors associated with unsuccessful implementation. Overall, 72 percent of the patients received all, 19 percent some, and 9 percent none of the planned home care services. Great variability was found in service delivery: Registered nurse visits were the most successfully delivered type of service; 24-hour companions were the least successfully delivered service. Further, over one-third of patients experienced termination or reduction of services between discharge and the follow-up interview 21 to 28 days after discharge.

The cases of 105 children hospitalized on selected units of an acute care, regional, pediatric hospital in the Midwest were studied. The most frequently encountered complications were financial, family unavailability and lack of cooperation, family inability/unwillingness to learn patient care, custody issues, unexpected medical developments, and transportation problems. Team differences in understanding the child's psychosocial situation and custody disputes were associated with delays in discharge. Private insurance, late referral, and lack of family availability were associated with the adequacy of the discharge plan, as rated by the discharge planner at discharge.

The findings revealed no statistically significant relationship, thus suggesting that purpose in life may not be a crucial factor in determining whether African American adolescents use prenatal care services. The need to explore the influence of other variables on service use and the importance of considering such findings for appropriate health care and social work intervention are discussed.Although prenatal care can prevent or minimize many of the risks associated with adolescent pregnancy, most young people either underutilize or avoid this service. This study investigated the hypothesis that adolescents who have a sound sense of life's meaning and purpose will have higher levels of participation in prenatal care than those without such direction. Respondents included 30 African-American adolescent females (mean age, 17 years) referred by a local health center. The mean score on Crumbaugh's Purpose-in-Life test was 97.3 out of a maximum of 140 (high purpose). Other studies utilizing this measure have yielded mean scores ranging from 108.5 for college undergraduates to 118.9 among successful businessmen and professionals. Correlation analysis failed to reveal any significant association between use of prenatal services and purpose in life scores. Overall, these findings suggest that health and social service providers should not place a major emphasis on such philosophical issues when attempting to encourage use of prenatal services among Black youth. It should be considered, however, that this particular measure may lack validity in a sample of very young African-Americans.

To develop effective strategies to meet the mental health needs of infected African Americans we need a better understanding of the pattern of Association between HIV and psychological distress. The objective of this study is to test several hypotheses that predict depression and anxiety in black adults infected with HIV. Our conceptual model is derived from learned helplessness theory (Seligman, 1975), the concept of perceived coherence (Antonovsky, 1980; Lewis &amp; Gallison, 1989), and social support theory (Cohen &amp; Willis, 1985). Instruments used in the study include: The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale (Radloff, 1977), the Anxiety Scale (Lewis, Firsich, and Parsell, 1979), and the Perceived Coherence Scale (Lewis, 1989). Data were obtained from 255 HIV infected black males and females (age &gt; or = 18) who sought support, counseling, and maintenance services from one of three HIV care and referral centers in the Mid-South.

Today, critical care extends beyond the immediate crisis. Technologic advances can prolong life and necessitate ongoing medical interventions.

With the availability of new treatment, HIV positive children are living longer, often into their school years, and most are able to live at home. The majority of children acquire HIV through maternal transmission. Frequently, multiple family members are HIV positive. Parents, or other caregivers, are overwhelmed by depression, anxiety and grief, and urgently need childcare assistance. Finding childcare is difficult since families are often reluctant to disclose the AIDS diagnosis to potential childcare workers. This article describes an innovative in-home respite care program for parents and caretakers of children who are HIV positive.

Characterized by symptoms which include mucous membrane irritation, eye irritation, headaches, feelings of lethargy and the inability to concentrate, sick building syndrome affects hundreds of thousands of office workers on a daily basis. The preponderance of victims of sick building syndrome are women. The threat to women's health posed by SBS is an under researched area, despite early research findings that women are disproportionately affected.

It was postulated that three central biographical issues--(1) the existence of an intimate environment; (2) the fulfillment of developmental tasks; and (3) engagement in a meaningful major activity--would be related to the survivor's present SOC. A structured interview was designed to cover different experiences of the survivors, focusing on these three issues at five age periods (6, 15, 24 and 45), in World War II and at present. Interviews were conducted with 20 elderly survivors born between 1920 to 1925. Quality of experience biographical scores at each age and in each of the three areas were assessed. Respondents also completed the SOC scale independently. A high correlation between the overall &quot;Biography&quot; score and the SOC was found. &quot;Meaningful major activity&quot; seems to play a more significant role in the subsequent development of a strong SOC than do the other two life issues.

A 16-item high-risk screening list is presented that was developed through an earlier analysis of discharge-delayed cases in a psychiatric hospital. The capacity of the list to accurately predict high-risk status was tested by comparing admission and discharge high-risk scores for 448 patients with a range of psychiatric disorders. Sixty-six percent of the patients rated high risk at admission were identically rated at discharge. Differences among risk groups were also found with respect to key demographic variables.

The PRACTICE model discussed in this article allows health care practitioners to think about ethical issues in a structured and systematic way.

Overall job satisfaction was found to be primarily determined by position satisfaction. The major correlate of position satisfaction was the professional respect received from other disciplines and not the specific tasks performed. These findings were interpreted as reflecting the obfuscating effect of hospital team interactions on job satisfaction. In these settings, the social workers were often so dependent on the quality of these team interactions to derive the variety, autonomy, and value in their work that it was difficult for them to keep subjectively clear the actual level of satisfaction with the work itself.

Controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, the main determinant of readmission was the discharge placement; those placed back into the community for care in the home were more likely to be rehospitalized than those discharged to institutions. Contrary to predictions in the literature and the authors' expectations, patient involvement in discharge planning had no discernible effect on placement decisions and subsequent hospitalization.

This bias defines male alcoholism as the standard by which female alcoholism is judged. Although alcoholism and treatment needs are unique in many ways, those differences are often minimized, ignored, or defined as abnormal in a male model of alcoholism.

The engagement process is particularly difficult for individuals who are referred for outpatient treatment following inpatient care. This article reports on the use of transition groups to improve the linkages between inpatient and outpatient alcoholism treatment. Findings revealed that clients who had access to a transition group had more favorable outcomes than did individuals who had no access to the group. The group was especially useful for inpatients who had encounters with the outpatient clinic before their hospitalizations.

Two hundred and twenty-five pregnant women defined as having high-risk pregnancies for psychosocial reasons were interviewed using a structured questionnaire when they presented for prenatal care at a large urban clinic. Women who admitted to problems with substance abuse were compared to those who denied a history of substance abuse. Women with an admitted history of substance abuse were significantly older, had more children, were more likely to live on their own or in an institutional setting, and more frequently reported that they currently smoked cigarettes. In addition, women with substance abuse problems delayed prenatal care an average of one month longer.

The survey was conducted from March to July 1992 among 510 citizens, educated and over 17 years old. Trained interviewers during a 20-minute interview used a structured questionnaire divided into six major sections. Respondents were asked to choose from the four possible responses, namely: 1) work together with couple to solve their problems; 2) help the wife find another place to stay; 3) help the wife obtain a court order; and 4) help the wife get a divorce. Demographic variables are included in the analysis. About 92.4% of the respondents indicated that social workers should limit their intervention to Â¿work with the coupleÂ¿ in dealing with cases of minor assault occurring for the first time. About 35.8% opted to help the wife obtain a court order, and 22.3% chose separation or divorce in minor assaults. Majority suggested that social workers should help the wife obtain a court order and separation on major assaults.

Constructions of women's bodies have changed throughout history but since the Enlightenment and, with it, the hegemony of science, they have been determined primarily by a biomedical perspective. This perspective results in a master medical narrative which reduced women's bodies, in general, to a biomedical reality; and their experience of menopause, specifically, to a biological event representing deterioration and decline.

Over half addressed issues of reproduction and sexuality including pregnancy, family planning, abortion, substance abuse in pregnancy, and fetal protection policies. Remaining articles addressed medical diagnoses; including AIDS/HIV/STDs, cancer, illnesses associated with aging, PMS, Turner's Syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome. Foci, methodologies, and recommendations are discussed and the authors critically analyze the articles' reflections of the status of women's health as a social work concern.The extent to which the social work profession is addressing women's health issues was assessed through a review of social work journals for the period 1985-92. Located were 36 articles in 11 journals, 19 of which covered reproductive health issues and 17 of which focused on medical diagnoses. The articles on reproduction fell into the following subcategories: pregnancy (6); family planning (5); abortion (4); substance abuse during pregnancy (2); and fetal protection policies (1). The articles on medical diagnoses covered the following conditions: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and other sexually transmitted diseases (6); breast cancer (4); aging (3); premenstrual syndrome (2); chronic fatigue syndrome (1); and Turner's syndrome (1). The preponderance of articles on reproduction suggests that social workers have adopted the hegemonic view of women as defined primarily by their reproductive role. Moreover, most of the articles reflected the disease perspective characteristic of the medical model. Notably absent were analyses of current health policies and structural phenomena (e.g., lack of employment opportunities or day care facilities) that impact on women's health.

The most common indicator of marketing success has been increments in the number of clients served. Health organizations are significantly more likely to measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts than social service agencies.

Data from social service agencies are used to compare administrators' assessments of the effectiveness of mandated and contracted relationships used to coordinate a group of agencies delivering services to children. When a mandated relationship has been formalized into a contract by a local administrator the perceived effectiveness of that relationship is higher than any other relationship in the community. If the mandated relationship has not been formalized by a contract this relationship is perceived to be the least effective.

These high rates of adolescent pregnancy and abortion have failed to significantly decline despite school curricula which instruct students in sex education and birth control. Adolescents often need counseling to evaluate the possible outcomes which may be associated with their behaviors. Abortion, in particular, can awaken strong emotions in those who undergo the procedure. Previewing, an interpersonal technique derived from caregiver-infant interactions, is a strategy which may be effective in counseling adolescents who are undergoing abortions. The process involves a caregiver representing through imagery a developmental skill the prospective infant is likely to achieve in the near future such as crawling. An enactment exercise is then devised during which the new skill may be practiced with the potential infant. The sequelae of previewing include an enhanced ability to predict and respond to upcoming developmental changes as well as changes in the interpersonal relationship between mother and infant. Previewing techniques may be used analogously with adolescents confronting abortion to help them represent alternatives for handling the pregnancy, predict the most beneficial alternatives, envision and work through negative emotions, and devise more adaptive behaviors to be enacted in the future so that pregnancy becomes a planned event rather than an accident.

Several other significant group differences included: up to twice as many index males as controls ever smoked; 2.5-3 times as many index groups used alcohol as controls. The statement &quot;getting a girl pregnant proves that you are a man&quot; was approved by 3% of controls, 8% of the unsure group, more than 10% of the nonterm group, and 20% of the term group (p .01). However, 86% of respondents agreed that birth control was a mutual responsibility, or 72% that it was a man's responsibility. 36% of the term group vs. 18% of controls agreed that birth control was a girl's obligation. 50% of term, 34% of nonterm, 36% of unsure compared with 14% of controls were involved in group fighting. 75%-79% of index males vs. 54% of controls reported involvement in vandalism, stealing, fighting, and truancy. High risk for injury ranged from 7% of controls to 40% of term males. 7% of controls vs. 20% of term males reported a history or treatment at a mental health clinic.",Health and risk behaviors of urban adolescent males involved in pregnancy.,1993,UNITED STATES,Fam Soc"Unmarried adolescent mothers face greater risk of less schooling, more emotional problems, higher poverty, and less income than those who relinquish their infants for adoption. Currently, around 5% of unmarried mothers give up their children for adoption (52,000 children annually, of which 24,500 are infants). Reasoned-action theory according to Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) was utilized in order to examine the potent family and personal variables that underlie this decision. In addition, a literature review of research studies applying reasoned-action theory to pregnant teenagers is provided, along with suggestions for clinical application of the theory. Family support has been found an important variable in the teenagers' decision. Family members may encourage or discourage the teenagers to keep the baby. Families may come closer together to cope with an unplanned pregnancy; however, some families experience deterioration of adaptability over time. The theory focuses 1) on the relationship of the individual and the decision or behavioral intention (BI), and 2) on immediate sociopsychological determinants of a BI. In some instances behavior (B) and BI are unrelated. The theory characterizes BIs in terms of the subjective probability concerning behavioral performance. The person's intention to perform a behavior is the result of a choice between behavioral alternatives: 1) adoption, 2) keeping the child as single mother, 3) keeping the child and raising it with the father in a formal relationship, 4) keeping the child and raising it with the help of parents. According to the Fishbein and Ajzen model, differences between minority and White relinquishment rates occur because these groups 1) differ in their beliefs and attitudes toward behavioral alternatives, 2) differ in normative beliefs, and/or 3) differ in relative weights they accord to attitudes versus cultural norms. This model with many variables is useful in measuring behavior, choice, and BI; attitudes and subjective norms; normative beliefs; and beliefs about consequences in clinical application by practitioners and agencies.",Decision making for pregnant adolescents: applying reasoned action theory to research and treatment.,1993,UNITED STATES,Fam Soc"Adolescent pregnancy increases the risk of pregnancy complications, low birth weight (LBW), and infant mortality. Complications include urinary tract infections, acute pyelonephritis, and preeclampsia. Full eclampsia is often fatal, thus preeclamptic women are delivered immediately. LBW (below 2500 g) is caused by prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation, both of which factors are associated with adolescence. In 1989, approximately 7% of all live births in the US were LBW (5.7% White and 13.5% Black). A large sample of births in 1975-78 found increased risk of neonatal mortality for the infants of adolescents, possibly owing to higher rates of LBW. In 1991, a random sample of 389 adolescent mothers who had given birth in 1983 indicated a 54% rate of depression, and even higher rates existed among those with 2 or more pregnancies. Additional risk factors include socioeconomic circumstances (poor housing, nutrition, and cultural deprivation). In a 1991 study of adolescent mothers, 80% of Blacks and 57% of Whites lived in female-headed households. Of the total, 1% of Blacks and 25% of Whites were married and living together. 45% of Whites and 58% of Blacks lived in poverty. Only 44% of these women used prenatal care in the 1st trimester, and 11% had no regular source of health care at 15-18 months after childbirth. A 1989 study of 253 pregnant women aged 19 or younger showed that 52.2% admitted drinking alcohol, 31.6% admitted using marijuana, and 13.8% admitted using cocaine during pregnancy. Nutritional problems included skipping meals and eating junk food, as well as not getting enough food, although they were entitled to government food stamps. Immaturity and lack of knowledge also contributed to poor health. Prenatal clinics, school-based clinics, and hospitals have to encourage prenatal care (e.g., the Johns Hopkins University comprehensive maternity-care program for adolescents), treat depression, assess their concrete needs regarding services and eligibility, and recognize that adolescents have cognitive and emotional limitations.",Health effects of adolescent pregnancy: implications for social workers.,1993,UNITED STATES,Fam Soc"Studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s on the impact of parent-teen communication on adolescent sexual behavior and contraceptive use generally failed to reveal any significant association. Although 30-60% of adolescents report some communication about sexuality with at least one parent, peers and printed material are identified as more valuable sources of information for decision making. No consistent relationship has been recorded between parental attitudes toward premarital sex (liberal or conservative) and their child's sexual behavior. The literature is limited, however, by serious gaps and methodological problems. Typically, researchers ask teenagers if they have engaged in discussions about sex or birth control with their parents and then correlate the finding with a measure of sexual or contraceptive behavior. Few studies have attempted to identify the content of these discussions (e.g., a mechanistic presentation of facts about reproduction versus an interactive exchange on the pros and cons of premarital intercourse) or acknowledge the complexity of the communication process. Also neglected has been the impact of the family context (e.g., the degree of cohesion or the structure of power relations) on the way in which information is presented and absorbed. Also absent has been any effort to elucidate why a given source of information is perceived, by the teenager, as useful. Finally, an emphasis on the teenager's perspective has led to a neglect of the impact of parental discomfort with discussions about sexuality and the identification of strategies to facilitate parent-child communication. Needed are multivariate research models that recognize the complex interplay among variables that shape premarital sexual behavior.",Parent-adolescent communication about premarital pregnancy.,1993,UNITED STATES,Fam Soc"A review of recent research findings suggests that social policies have a significant effect on adolescent pregnancy and its outcomes. Excluded from the analysis were studies that did not control for the influence of personal, familial, and environmental factors on adolescent sexual behavior. Policies most likely to prevent undesired outcomes are those offering tangible family planning services and improving both the access to and affordability of abortion. Most effective in improving contraceptive use among teenagers appear to be comprehensive community-based programs with links to local schools. There is no evidence that efforts to promote values such as abstinence or enhance self-esteem are successful. However, job training, guaranteed student loans, and other measures that improve the educational and earnings opportunities of adolescents may have an indirect impact on reducing teenage pregnancy and childbearing by providing an incentive for deferred parenthood. The research concerning the impact of AFDC benefits is inconclusive, but higher welfare benefits appear to discourage marriage. In addition, the deteriorating economic status of young males over the past 15 years has increased the proportion of out-of-wedlock births.",The effect of social policies on teenage pregnancy and childbearing.,1993,UNITED STATES,Fam Soc"To obtain qualitative data on perceptions of self and body during adolescent pregnancy, diaries maintained by 14 young women recruited from school-based programs for pregnant teens in Idaho were reviewed. The adolescents ranged in age from 15-19 years (mean, 16 years). Each week, for six weeks, study subjects wrote diary entries on two topics: &quot;My thoughts about myself&quot; and &quot;My thoughts about my body.&quot; The affective quality of the entries was rated on a scale of 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive). Feelings about self had an overall mean score of 2.18; the words &quot;edgy,&quot; &quot;depressed,&quot; &quot;lonely,&quot; and &quot;moody&quot; appeared frequently. Key terms used to describe body image (mean score, 2.40) were &quot;fat,&quot; &quot;huge,&quot; and &quot;ugly.&quot; Discernible was a conflict between the weight gain of pregnancy and the culture's emphasis on thinness. Self-related diary entries were more variable (grand mean change score, 1.89) than body-image entries (1.56). There was no association between affective scores and demographic factors such as age, health status, number of previous pregnancies, or living arrangements. The bodily changes and fluctuating moods associated with pregnancy appeared, in these adolescents, to exacerbate the instability that accompanies the normal developmental process of adolescence. Teachers and health professionals who work with pregnant adolescents should be alert to the need for self-esteem building and social support in this population.",Feelings about self and body during adolescent pregnancy.,1993,UNITED STATES,Fam Soc"Caring for Alzheimer's patients places tremendous burdens and strain on families. This study examined the ways cultural values and norms influence the experiences of Hispanic caregivers. The results revealed relationships between attitudes toward caregiving and a sense of burden and depression among the caregivers, with depression being related to stronger adherence to norms of filial support. Factors associated with increased burden include lack of time for oneself, dependency needs of the patient, and belief that one could be doing a better job as caregiver. Problems common to other groups of caregivers--feelings of anger, relationship and financial strain, and isolation--were not apparent. Although relatives provide affective support, the burden of instrumental assistance rests on the primary caregiver.

Assessments were done at an outpatient diabetes clinic of family coping, resources, and stress; disease-related knowledge; metabolic control (HbA1); and endogenous insulin (C peptide). Results indicated that higher levels of family stress and lower levels of family resources as reported by fathers were significantly associated with poor metabolic control. Multiple regression analyses revealed that levels of family stress and resources were more strongly related to metabolic control than were disease variables such as C peptide levels. Moreover, family stress was directly associated with metabolic control, and family resources showed indirect linkages.

To provide data on this issue, a study was conducted in four school-based health clinics in a large midwestern city. The results of this study document the use of the clinic for multiple issues and provide statistical support for the clinical impressions of the staff that students, despite their stated reason for visiting the clinic, were equally likely to have other physical and mental health problems.",School-based clinics: a response to the physical and mental health needs of adolescents.,1993,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"The process of discharge planning is often impeded by disagreements among family members and others involved. A discharge plan must be negotiated to meet the varying needs of participants within the context of regulatory and organizational mandates. Under such circumstances, disagreements in decision making can be anticipated, particularly for family members, who must readjust roles and relationships in the face of the crisis of illness. Support for this conceptual formulation is found in the literature, particularly in two studies that evaluated the incidence of disagreements in discharge planning caseloads. In both studies, disagreements occurred in at least one-third of the cases, with most disagreements involving family members. Neither study found substantial disagreement among professionals. Social workers who provide discharge planning services in hospitals clearly are dealing with substantial levels of disagreements among principals in the process; in fact, disagreement needs to be accepted as a normative phenomenon in such planning.

Despite these trade-offs, case management can be effective if it is designed so that services match client needs and the costs of services are measured accurately. Case management for chronically mentally ill people is particularly difficult to design because their level of functioning and need for intensive services are such that the cost to deliver the appropriate services is great.

The expected outcomes of reduced rates of emergency room visits and readmissions, or greater satisfaction with health services were not achieved. Rather, the study group patients had significantly higher rates of emergency room visits, and tended to be less satisfied with discharge planning and significantly less satisfied with post-hospital health services. No differences in readmission rates were observed. The study patients were more likely to be discharged to a home-care program and to have received such services or still be in the LTC institutions to which they had been referred at follow-ups.

More than a decade into the epidemic, it is clear that the cultural, psychosocial, and functional impact of AIDS stretches beyond that on our traditional concept of kin to a broader view of family. At the cultural level AIDS has challenged our notions of who is and functions as a family, while also shaping our behaviors and language. Within families, the psychosocial impact of a family member having a stigmatized illness generates a range of emotional responses. While certain of these responses are common to all families, they will also vary by the family constellation affected.

They used a high social risk identification and screening process and developed a protocol describing essential elements of the clinical social work practice. Program development was practice-based and empirical, using practice experience and drawing from relevant literature.Attention to the psychosocial needs of women undergoing induced abortion can be as important as the procedure itself, especially among those at risk of postabortion emotional problems. Described is a high-risk screening and counseling program developed by the Obstetric Social Work Department at South Australia's Queen Elizabeth Hospital for public patients seeking pregnancy termination for psychosocial reasons. Referral for social work services was automatically effected in 3 scenarios: 1) age under 18 years, 2) termination of 2nd trimester pregnancies, and 3) women uncertain or ambivalent about the decision to abort. Patients who do no fall into these high-risk categories are informed about the option of social work services; about 20% accept. A protocol for each high-risk indicator has been developed to define potential themes for counseling, set clinical standards, and form the basis for the monitoring of consistency of service delivery among social workers. In the case of women who are ambivalent about the decision to abort, for example, the protocol sets the objectives of enabling the patient to take responsibility for the decision to abort and its consequences, encouraging her to discuss any aspects related to the pregnancy and abortion, assisting her to cope with associated psychosocial problems (e.g., relationship with partner), and ensuring she has access to the appropriate pregnancy service. Within this general framework, social workers can select from a range of treatment modalities, including crisis intervention, problem solving, psychoeducation, and bereavement theory.

The multiple constituency dilemma coupled with the retrenchment of the 1970s and 1980s has led to a great gulf separating managers from clients, and managers from front-line personnel. These political factors have been reinforced by management theory and the blind adoption of &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; management technologies developed in business and the military, and the separation has gained legitimacy. The result is less than optimal service, a dissatisfied workforce, and continued attacks for being inefficient, self-serving, and ineffective. The purpose of this article is to portray an alternative form of human service management. Its vision places clients center stage in our organizations and places the manager as the director and producer. It accepts the premises that &quot;management is the principle engine of progress&quot; (Levitt, 1976) and that management is performance. It then lays a foundation for client-centered management by presenting four principles for social service administrators who desire to adopt this perspective in their daily practice. An elaboration of the skills and methods of client-centered management can be found in a recently published text (Rapp &amp; Poertner, 1991).",Management is performance: strategies for client-centered practice in social service organizations.,1992,UNITED STATES,Adm Soc Work,AIDS: social work and mandatory screening.,1992,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"This article reviews the clinical decision-making process involved in planning for continuity of care following discharge from inpatient psychiatric services.

This article examines three issues: (1) the extent to which elderly people most in need receive social work services, (2) the extent to which the discharge planning performed is a professional task, and (3) the effectiveness of discharge planning for those who return to their homes after hospitalization. The study focused on 1,100 elderly patients from five Baltimore hospitals. Data were gathered from their social workers, from the patients themselves (by phone after discharge), and from medical records. Results show that only a minority of elderly patients who return to the community after hospitalization receive social work services while in the hospital but that those who do are likely to have posthospital needs. In most cases, the discharge planning uses professional skills, but 28 percent of cases are fairly routine. Finally, social work services were effective in reducing the level of unmet needs in the areas of nursing, medication, and physical therapy.","Evaluating social work discharge planning services for elderly people: access, complexity, and outcome.",1992,United States,Health Soc Work"A problem in the provision of home health care for elderly people is the limited number of family members available for caregiving.

Four psychoeducational workshops were designed to motivate personal risk reduction, provide participants with necessary cognitive and behavioral skills, and enhance participants' perceived ability to enact positive changes in their lives. The development of the workshop modules was guided by traditional theories of health behavior change and social learning. Also included in the intervention are referral and advocacy services, personal risk reduction counseling, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing. Preliminary results indicate that the program has made a significant impact on the AIDS risk of participants--91 percent of women who completed the program reported that they had made positive changes in their lives to reduce their risk of HIV infection.Preliminary results of a psychoeducational program for the female sex partners of intravenous drug users suggest that this approach can motivate women to make behavioral changes that reduce their risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Sexual contact with an intravenous drug user was identified, in 1991, as the primary risk factor in 4484 cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the US. The program was developed and implemented, on a pilot basis, by health and mental health professionals in Long Beach, California. Program components included risk reduction counseling, HIV antibody testing, referral for social and medical services, free condoms and bleach for cleaning needles, and participation in a series of 4 interactive workshops. By the end of the 3rd workshop session, participants are expected to make a personal commitment to reducing their risk of HIV infection, set specific short-term risk reduction goals, and articulate a plan for achieving them. In the 4th session, women practice partner negotiation skills and identify positive sources of social support. To date, 84 women have attended at least 1 workshop and 69 have completed all 4 sessions. The majority of participants were Black and Hispanic women on public assistance; although recruitment was limited to women who were not intravenous drug users, 40% were regular crack cocaine users. Interviews conducted with 53 participants immediately after the last workshop revealed numerous indicators of attitudinal and behavioral change. 91% indicated that the program had induced them to make changes in their life to reduce their HIV risk. All but 1 women had spoken with her male partner about stopping or reducing his drug use and 68% of women who had not used condoms before entering the program adopted condom use. 45% reported they had asked their male partner to mover out of the household and 15% had either moved out themselves or successfully evicted their partner due to his refusal to negotiate HIV risk reduction behaviors.

Some theorists believe that high levels of expressed emotion predispose schizophrenic patients for relapse. However, recent trends in family therapy indicate that high expressed emotion may naturally result from caring for an ill family member. Families may therefore often feel unfairly blamed by practitioners for causing mental illness. The author examines the usefulness of integrating expressed emotion measures into family therapy from three theoretical perspectives: the transactional perspective, the coping and adaptation perspective, and the systems perspective. Each of these perspectives provides a framework for incorporating expressed emotion measures into the broader context of research on and treatment of schizophrenia. The author postulates that appropriate controls designed to reduce pent-up emotion in families must accompany expressed emotion interventions in family therapy.

The purpose of these mechanisms is to identify patients upon admission who are most likely to need service. Because these screening mechanisms often identify patients who do not need service, this study determined how well the patient characteristics used as screening factors actually predicted service utilization. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed using 1,659 discharges from two midwestern hospitals. The most powerful predictors of social service use were age, multi-system illness, not having a spouse, and psychiatric co-morbidity.

Family members of both types of patients were assigned randomly to an experimental group, which received systematic training in performing case management activities, or to a control group, which received only the services ordinarily provided by the hospital social work department. Post-test comparisons revealed that the experimental group family members performed significantly more case management tasks on behalf of their elderly relatives than did family members in the control group.

These long stays are often associated with long social care stays which occur when patients no longer require acute care and are awaiting post-discharge services. In this study, actual acute care LOS and social care LOS were studied specifically in hospitalized frail elderly. Our data demonstrate that frail elderly receiving only acute care do not suffer markedly prolonged total LOS (TLOS). However, in hospitalized frail elderly patients who experience acute care and social care stays, social care LOS accounts for over half of all hospital days. When patients were grouped and studied according to the type of post-discharge services being sought by the health care team, significant differences in acute LOS and social care LOS were noted. Subgroups of patients were also identified among the various groups which differed significantly in their LOS parameters. Patients who required more than one discharge plan during the course of hospitalization experienced the longest hospital stays of all groups, and spent almost 70% of these days receiving non-acute social care. In a study of the relationship between the intensity of social work intervention and social care LOS in the frail elderly, a statistically significant relationship was noted between the timing and frequency of social work intervention and the actual length of social care stays. Early and frequent social work interventions were associated with significantly shorter social care LOS. We conclude that the study of TLOS should include acute LOS and social care LOS to obtain a reliable measure of the course and cost of hospital care for the frail elderly. The study of social care subgroups may facilitate future investigations to define the social care problems which contribute most to TLOS, and the patient populations which should be most heavily targeted for early and intensive social work intervention.",Studies of hospital social stays in the frail elderly and their relationship to the intensity of social work intervention.,1992,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Two urban programs of family-centered case management services were established for families of children with both a developmental disability and a chronic health condition.

Results indicate that the moderating effects of social network size and support were different for the black people than for the white people in this sample. For white aged people, having greater social support and a larger social network reduces the association between stress and depressive symptoms, as expected. For black elderly people, however, having more network members and receiving support from them is associated with a stronger relationship between stress and depressive symptomatology.",Social support networks of white and black elderly people at risk for institutionalization.,1991,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic is significantly affecting older people.

Data were collected on the Medicaid expenditures of 54 eligible participants and their dependents for up to two years before they exited welfare; the expenditures averaged 56 percent less for adults and 45 percent less for children than the respective AFDC averages for the county. Because only 22 percent of the eligible participants took advantage of the program, telephone interviews also were conducted with 24 people who did not participate in or dropped out of the health plan. The main reasons cited for not enrolling were a misunderstanding of the program, a claim that no notification of the program was received, and a lack of interest.

The women felt they shared much in common with their male partners and generally felt understood and supported by the men. However, many of the women also saw their responses to the loss as different from those of their male partners. A variety of coping patterns were adopted by the women in the face of these differences. Implications are considered for preventive efforts to minimize distress; treatment approaches to help couples who experience greater difficulties; and future research directions.To study women's emotional and coping response after loss of pregnancy, a group of 121 women who had participated in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development collaborative Chorionic Villus Sampling and Amniocentesis Study and who had elective abortion or miscarriage were interviewed. The group was mainly white, married, university educated, and affluent. They lost their pregnancy at mean 13.7 weeks gestation. They were interviewed with a semi structured telephone interview at 1-2 and again at 6 months after the event. The quality of the marriage was judged by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, and each women also completed a Partner Support Scale and the Profile of Mood States. The women's scores on partner support were close to the norm soon after the loss, but declined slightly (p = .03) at 6 months. Qualitative results of the interviews pointed out several differences in the experience between women and their partners: women experienced the pain, inconvenience, and physical recovery; women felt grief for a longer period, and they tended to express their feelings verbally. Women noted that men often either expressed less distress or were less verbal. Men's coping styles included intellectualizing and physical acting-out, e.g., purchasing a motorcycle. Descriptions of couples' coping patterns evidenced some struggle in achieving understanding after the loss. These interviews suggest that most couples who lose a pregnancy do not need therapeutic intervention from a mental health provider, but some may benefit by supportive follow-up, education about the impact of genetic disorders on families, and assistance on decisions about future pregnancies or dealing with the decision not to have children.",Women's voices after pregnancy loss: couples' patterns of communication and support.,1991,United States,Soc Work Health Care,Recruitment and retention of MSW graduates.,1991,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"This paper describes a community-based agency's approach to reducing perinatal risk among populations at high medical, familial and environmental risk.

It is important to identify such patients who frequently need help with discharge planning from social workers during their first admission. This study utilized computerized data on 628 patients, 238 of whom were readmissions. Question was raised as to what factors (functional, psychological, social and environmental), differentiated patients who were readmitted from those who were not. Using logistic regression, three variables: marital status, presence of coping difficulty and age of patients were identified as predictors of readmission within three months. Those who were married were less likely to be readmitted. Those with coping difficulties and older individuals were more likely to be readmitted. The accuracy of prediction, using these three factors, was 61 percent. Of those patients predicted as not being readmitted, sixty-nine percent were correctly predicted, while 39 percent were readmitted. Of patients predicted as readmissions, 49 percent were correctly predicted, while 51 percent were not.

The author reviews eight of these myths by reference to eight motivational theories which refute them: need theory, expectancy theory, feedback theory, equity theory, reinforcement theory, cognitive evaluation theory, goal setting theory, and social influence theory. Although most of these theories have been developed and applied in the private sector, relevant research has also been conducted in social service agencies. The author concludes with a summary of guidelines suggested by the eight theories for motivating human service workers.",Eight myths on motivating social services workers: theory-based perspectives.,1990,UNITED STATES,Adm Soc Work"Too often, systematic recording procedures are not developed which describe and assess the delivery of social work--and, more specifically, case management--services.

This analysis is part of a research project that entailed a comprehensive study of both the fiscal patterns and policy patterns of nonprofit organizations. Through the use of interviews in an exploratory descriptive design, several major patterns were identified concerning organizational adaptation. Three categories of events effected the adaptation of these organizations: executive staff turnover, program/service structure change and financial issues. The three industrial subsectors studied demonstrated unique patterns in these events. A reactive decision making style was the overwhelming choice of these organizations. Leadership was a phenomenon shared by CEOs and Boards of Directors.

The author used a survey of 229 California hospitals to test the hypothesis that the discharge planning process is the same regardless of the discipline or department in which it is located. The only significant difference among the social work, nursing, and administrative departments was in the type of staff used. Social work departments were more likely to have both a social worker and a nurse on the discharge planning staff and on the discharge planning team. The needs of the organization, rather than professional perspectives, drove discharge planning.

A special scale was developed to evaluate specific cognitions, behaviors, and anxiety during confrontations with the physician, dietitian, nurse, and secretary. Another special scale was developed to evaluate compliance with self-care behaviors in diabetes. Cognitive and behavioral coping skills specific to patient-medical team encounters were found to be significant correlates of various compliance variables in the following order: maintenance of positive self-esteem and efficacy during criticism, positive acceptance of criticism, avoidance of conflict by offering compromise solutions, and assertive request for follow-up with a specific doctor.

As changes occur in the patient and the hospice settings, the participants join together to bring about a satisfactory fit between the person needing care and the environment. By anticipating the needs and reactions of the terminally ill patient to each transition in the care process, the social worker assists in orchestrating proactive interventions through the continuum of hospice care. Future research studies are recommended for determining what difference social work actions make toward ensuring a &quot;safe passage.&quot;",Hospice: social work's response to a new form of social caring.,1990,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care,Health policy: problems and priorities.,1990,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Involving patients in making decisions about their medical treatment and health care is a widely accepted goal. Yet there is considerable debate about what constitutes effective involvement, how much involvement is desirable, what are the benefits of involvement and how practitioners can help patients recognize and communicate their own preferences.

Families who had successful follow-up periods tended to be characterized by intact marriages, private insurance coverage, less subjective financial stress, and higher intellectual and developmental functioning in the child. Single-parent families who had no pre-evaluation involvement with liver transplant organizations and had lengthy post-operative hospital stays more frequently had complications post-transplant.

Disagreement within the team was expressed covertly and overtly. In the face of conflicting perceptions, team members attempted to influence others to agree with them, changed their own recommendations, or tried to find an area of compromise. Team members did not fully address differences across disciplines. Interactions during these cases suggest that team members see themselves primarily as representatives of their own discipline rather than as members of a team. Different values and theoretical perspectives seem to influence divergence of opinion. A need for a common value base, language, and conceptual framework was evident.",NA,1990,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"This study examined the intellectual ability, academic performance, behavior, and social perceptions of children with a seizure disorder and their nonafflicted siblings. These data suggest the children are at risk for developmental lag and related problems. Impact of the illness on the family differentiated the sibling pair on many tasks and on parents' feelings towards their children. Although parents reported providing a normal environment for their children, the children reported their perceptions of the home environment to be further from the (population norm) than their parents. These results provide evidence for the whole family being affected by the chronic illness thus supporting social work's inherent holistic view. It also underscores the need for a secondary preventive approach with all families containing a child with a handicapping condition.",Effects of childhood chronic illness on families.,1990,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"While workers' reasons for leaving jobs are myriad, little is known of what might induce workers to remain in jobs.

During the developmental stage, before processes have been formalized, attention is given to the political realities, the formation of a representative planning group, formulating goals and objectives, obtaining administrative support, information gathering, assessment of needs, resource procurement, program structure and design, selection of a case management model, participatory decision making, determining organizational fit, and beginning networking. During the phase-in or early implementation state, the formal stage of system introduction, attention is given to the establishment of interorganizational relationships, contracting for services, job descriptions, work assignments, training, problem solving, and conflict resolution. During the operational or full implementation stage, a period when the system should become more stabilized, attention needs to be given to managing movement of the client through the system, the flow of information, program updating, quality assurance, recordkeeping, resource management, evaluating, and system refurbishing. In practice, these stages will interact and overlap.

By doing so, we would be repeating the mistakes of the 1960s by instituting changes that will not result in fundamental and log term improvements to societal human services systems. Change can only flow from recognition that there are two types of management that must co-exist: institutional and trans-organizational. In public and nonprofit social work agencies, the former is almost the sole focus of administrative knowledge and skills. Slowly, all the human services (Jaeger, Kaluzny &amp; Magruder-Habib, 1987) are beginning to concentrate on trans-organizational systemic arrangements. Increasingly, social work administrators are acquiring knowledge++ and ability in trans-organizational management.

The relationships between these categories of dysfunction and the following three social environmental factors were examined: (1) acceptance and emotional support from family and friends; (2) disease-specific support from peers who have had the same surgical intervention and from professionals; and (3) socioeconomic status (SES). Data were collected from 60 total laryngectomy patients an average of 24.3 months after surgery. The type of support provided was different for each source of support, family-friend or peer-professional. Interpersonal support from family and friends was strongly associated with psychosocial and physical dysfunction but had a weaker association with speech adjustment. Diseases-specific support from speech therapists and other laryngectomees was a weaker predictor of dysfunction but a stronger predictor of communication adaptation. SES was not predictive of dysfunction or communication adaptation. Thus different sources of social support can make specific contributions to minimizing physical and psychosocial dysfunction and acquiring skills to overcome the limitations imposed by the surgery.",Social environment and adjustment after laryngectomy.,1989,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"Many political, economic, and social factors are influencing health care providers to consider case-management programs. The authors describe a computer-supported, hospital-based case management program for elderly patients and report on the benefits and drawbacks of the program. Primary benefits include access to better client data, improved discharge planning capabilities, and greater program efficiency. Drawbacks chiefly are related to the difficulties inherent in introducing computerization into a human service setting. Overall, the program is a beneficial addition to patient care efforts and is a valuable tool for tracking high-risk patients in acute-care settings.",Monitoring patient outcome following discharge: a computerized geriatric case-management system.,1989,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"Social workers collecting data in this study of the psychosocial impact of breast cancer not only gained insights into clinical efforts and program planning, but also had opportunities for clinical intervention.

Presentation of clinical data suggests that elaboration of life narratives, by means of reminiscence, may help people to regain a cohesive sense of self, carry out psychological and social tasks, and revise life structures in the context of the illness experience. The author demonstrates how narrative approaches, informed by developmental theory, shift the focus from disability and dysfunction to concern for relative health and personal growth in social intervention with this population.

A total of 243 patients referred for social services at a 440-bed teaching hospital were evaluated. Paired t-tests indicated a significant difference in the mean length of stay based on normative data. Timing of the intervention accounted for a significant amount of variance (13 percent) in length of hospital stay. The major clinical implications of the study are that social work intervention has the potential to decrease length of hospitalization, and that this methodology may be used reliably to evaluate changes in discharge planning protocol.",Timing of social work intervention and medical patient's length of hospital stay.,1989,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work,Stand up and cheer!,1989,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"The authors describe an intensive aftercare program for children in residential treatment.

Thirty-two home-care workers from six community-based, home-care programs sponsored by New York area Catholic Charities agencies were studied. The subjects predominantly were female, white, observant Christians, with a median age of 49 years. Test scores revealed little reported stress; however, interviews revealed significant stress that resulted primarily from interpersonal interactions, affective tasks, and insufficient pay. Coping strategies appeared to include denial, identification with clients, altruism. Low pay was the workers' primary dissatisfaction.

Psychological distress, marital distress, AIDS-related dating problems, and AIDS-related sexual problems were examined. Potential predictors were illness-related indicators, subjective assessments of sources and consequences of vulnerability to HIV, social sources of distress such as AIDS-related isolation and discrimination, and behaviors respondents engaged in to assess or reduce their risk of infection.

Social workers have been quick to blame the medical model for problems in health care and consequently have overlooked useful lessons from this model that could improve social work practice. To work effectively with physicians, social workers must be aware of physicians' professional values and be able to identify conflicts with social work values. Conflicting values in social work and medicine are identified in five areas: (1) saving life versus quality of life, (2) patient autonomy in setting treatment goals, (3) attitudes toward objective versus subjective data, (4) responses to patients with emotional problems, and (5) differing perspectives on interdisciplinary team roles. Case illustrations based on the author's experiences as director of behavioral science training for resident family practice physicians are included.

However, social workers require additional data to better understand the use of this innovation. Formative data on how referral agents perceive one case management program for elderly people is provided. Most of the 137 referral agents who responded to questionnaires (259 questionnaires were mailed) viewed the program as appropriate in addressing basic social support needs of elderly people and inappropriate in addressing more complex physical and mental health problems. Although the referral agents perceived staff to be generally qualified, they also perceived the program to be understaffed and not building adequate awareness of its availability.

Community-based AIDS service organizations have emerged to meet this challenge by providing critical services to people with AIDS at a time when other health and social service systems were slow to respond. Results of a nationwide survey indicate that social workers are fully enmeshed in these new community health care agencies, perform a variety of social work and administrative functions, and face challenges to professional self-awareness.

Coordinated care case management programs were developed in seven hospitals to determine whether hospitals could serve as a logical entry point of frail elderly persons into the system. Examination of the experiences of these hospitals illustrated the need for models of service integration and resulted in several approaches to comprehensive service delivery and coordination.

As their numbers continue to grow, it is likely that social workers in health care and social service agencies serving either the mentally retarded or the aged will increasingly encounter such older persons as clients.

The purpose of this paper is to describe psychosocial influences on the researcher-participant interaction during: (1) recruitment, (2) enrollment, and (3) retention and to provide guidelines for effective implementation of a study within a clinical health care setting. An interdisciplinary teamwork approach was used to identify and to resolve psychosocial issues. A study of 4781 family planning patients will be used as the case example.Between 1984 and 1986, staff from 5 family planning clinics in western Pennsylvania enrolled 4781 women in a study of genital herpes. Clinic staff conducted follow-up contacts with them biannually and examined them yearly for 3 years. A social worker served as a consultant and liaison in the context of being a trouble-shooter. A nurse-researcher headed up onsite data collection and supervised nurses who visited clinic sites often during the week. They identified psychosocial issues as they arose. The principal investigator made all final decisions on interventions. The interdisciplinary team developed guidelines for researchers in recruitment, enrollment, and retention of study subjects. Some recruitment guidelines included developing positive relationships with staff who are the referring personnel to the study, conducting interview training before recruitment begins, and providing a private place to recruit study subjects. Some enrollment guidelines were to be physically present at routine intervals at the referring site,, be willing to make acceptable changes in research protocol to accommodate referring site, and inform subjects about the disease/condition being studies. Researchers need to stay in contact with subjects by either face-to-face meetings, phone calls, or mail as well as at the clinic to promote high retention. They also need to encourage questions and concerns of subjects. Researchers should also refer them to appropriate resources when needed. Social workers should consider these guidelines when interested in research since they promote a favorable environment amid many implementation problems. Since social workers receive academic and professional training in individual and group dynamics, administration, and research design and methodology, they are suitable to foster cooperative agreements in an interdisciplinary team.","Psychosocial influences on research subject recruitment, enrollment and retention.",1989,United States,Soc Work Health Care"This paper examines empathy as a practice component that is particularly significant in its relationship to self-determination in the discharge process in acute hospital settings.

Most of those interviewed had used modern contraceptives previously, but not before their most recent pregnancy. The interruption in contraceptive use resulted from adverse side effects of the contraceptives and instability in partner relationships.At least 1/3 of Jewish women in Israel have had induced abortions. The 72 women who participated in this study had received abortion approval from a medical committee. (Abortions for social reasons are not legal in Israel; there are therefore many illegal abortions.) 82% were between 17-28; 62% were single; 62% were born in Israel of North African descent; 26% had 9 or less years of education, and 74% had 10 or more years of education. 62.5% had used medically prescribed contraceptives in the previous 2 years, buy only 11% had used them in the previous 6 months; 47% had used rhythm or withdrawal in the previous 6 months; and 26% had not used any method in the previous 6 months. Of the 13 women who had never used any kind of contraception, only 1 did not know about it; 6 thought that they did not need it. Of the 14 women who had never used any method except withdrawal, rhythm, condoms, or cream, most said that they feared cancer and weight gain from pills and bleeding and uterine damage from IUDs. Of the total sample 62% said that they had stopped using prescribed contraceptives because they feared the side effects. 32% said that they had stopped because they had an unstable relationship with their sex partner. Women of low socioeconomic status tended to use natural methods because they cost nothing. 86% of the women said that they feared the pain and adverse side effects of abortion, but evidently less than they feared those of effective contraceptives.

The complex problem of multiple pregnancies among teenagers is explored. Current knowledge regarding the incidence and correlates of repeated pregnancy is summarized and reviewed. Intervention strategies and directions for further research are suggested.Research on teen pregnancy has usually focused on causes, incidence, and strategies on reduction, but recently some work has been done on the complex problem of repeated pregnancies. Evidence shows increased health risks associated with repeated pregnancies. The number of these cases questions the validity of access to birth control information and the desire to prevent pregnancy as sufficient means to stop teen pregnancy. The rate of teen pregnancy is increasing as well as sexual activity, and the birth rate is increasing in relation to the increase in abortions. In 1981, 22% of teens who gave birth has a previous birth, and 13% of those having abortions had a previous birth. Recent studies, although not confirmed, estimate that repeated pregnancies range from 17% in the 1st year up to 38% within 2 years for teens. The earlier the 1st pregnancy, the more likely a 2nd pregnancy will occur and in 80% of the cases, an unintended one. Those with a lower educational status and especially high school dropouts tend to have multiple pregnancies. Higher rates of repeated pregnancies occur in Hispanic and black teens than in white teens, with Hispanic being the highest. Birth control use appears to decline after the 1st pregnancy due to side effects and health fears. Teens having abortions seem to receive little attention concerning prevention of future pregnancies.

She illustrates the similarity between the social planning process and the market planning process in an effort to demonstrate that social marketing is a useful addition to decision making and planning in social service agencies. Social marketing theory, diffusion theory, and exchange theory provide the theoretical frameworks for the argument developed. Drawing upon these theories, the paper draws attention to the fact that marketing is rapidly gaining acceptance as a viable strategy in macro practice designed to attract and retain consumers of services, develop resources, and inform service providers and practitioners of practice issues and innovations.",Marketing of social services gains prominence in practice.,1986,UNITED STATES,Adm Soc Work"It is argued in this paper that government allocations for human services based on inputs rather than outcomes, reduce efficiency in social and health service provision. An alternative system of budgeting or contracting on the basis of cost-per-closed case and case outcome is discussed. An interdependency between fixed budget and fixed utility models of allocation is affirmed. The locus of decision-making for operationalizing this interdependency is seen as the program and budget review panel to which operating agencies and government departments must submit financial and program accounting information from year to year. In isolation, the fixed budget approach degenerates into routine allocation or contract renewal with a focus on such input and output variables as volume of service and unit cost, and the fixed utility approach, into political stalemate. Simulated examples are given to demonstrate how allocation on the basis of inputs and outputs alone provides an incentive to inefficiency, and a fixed utility orientation to efficiency.",Funding human services: fixed utility versus fixed budget.,1986,UNITED STATES,Adm Soc Work,Main Street revisited: social work practice in rural areas.,1986,UNITED STATES,Soc Casework"Changing the focus of an adolescent day treatment program from individual-oriented to family-oriented at an institution in Green Bay, Wisconsin, reduced the number of adolescents placed out-of-home after discharge and changed problematic behavior sooner.",Benefits of a family-oriented approach in adolescent treatment.,1986,UNITED STATES,Soc Casework"The author reexamines the issue of accountability from the perspective of administrative implications for human service organizations, both voluntary and governmental.

This article describes: organizational issues significant to the integration of research into a health service system; interpersonal issues that effect the perspectives of research and service professionals in the daily operation of the research project; and social work skills for collaborative research studies. An on-going 5-year collaborative research study of approximately 7,000 participants will be used as a case example.This article presents principles of collaborative multi-organizational research for use by social workers. To illustrate the organizational and interpersonal issues related to implementation of a joint research-service project, an ongoing study of the epidemiology of genital herpes is used as a case study. This project seeks to follow approximately 7000 women, drawn from Pennsylvania family planning clinics, for a 3-year period to determine the incidence and natural history of genital herpes. In the planning phase, the social worker was central in discussing the study design, methods of patient recruitment, and overall study purposes with the family planning clinic staff and in identifying potential problem areas (e.g., professional boundaries regarding patient contact, sharing of medical records). Another component of the preimplementation phase of a collaborative research-service project is the in-service education of clinical staff.

Areas of potential conflict related to decision-making are identified along with the implications for social work practice.The results of a study of 517 US women seeking abortion at 2 outpatient abortion clinics and 1 family planning agency in South Central Kansas are presented regarding attitudes about abortion in general, feelings about the specific decision to have an abortion and the social networks utilized in the decision-making process. Questionnaires were used to collect the data before the abortion procedure. Study subjects tended to have positive attitudes about abortion as an alternative to an unwanted pregnancy. They also tended to have positive feelings about their personal decision. 72% stated that they sought help from someone regarding what to do about their pregnancy. 41% had spoken with their partners, and 29% talked with friends. 21% discussed their pregnancy with a physician, 15% talked with their mothers, and 10% spoke with other family members. Only 4% discussed the issue with their fathers and 1% spoke to a member of the clergy. An additional 6% spoke with &quot;others,&quot; which included nurses, social workers, and other professionals. 27% of the sample indicated that they had sought professional counseling. Parenting readiness was the reason most often given for having an abortion. Lack of financial resources was the next largest category, followed by no partner. The findings indicate that although women arrive at the decision to have an abortion from very divergent pathways, most of them go through the decision-making process with no apparent difficulty. However, there are some women for whom this process seems to be more problematic. Those women who are non-white, non-Protestant, younger, less educated, with less income, non-contraceptive users, or lacking a supportive social network appear to be at risk of encountering potentially severe conflicts along the path to a decision.

Most caregivers report physical and emotional problems due to caregiving ranging from hypertension and back problems to depression and mental exhaustion. The characteristics of caregivers at high risk for health problems are identified. Less than half of the caregivers have family or friends to assist them with caregiving.

The issue of genocide is limited to black women only, because the historical material on the genocide question and the findings of current studies on minorities are generally based on data collected from the black population. The 1st stage of the birth control movement failed to address any issues that were pertinent to black women. Early in the 20th century, with the advent of the 2nd stage of the birth control movement, a public controversy demonstrated the racist and anti working class attitudes that were dominant among feminists and advocates of birth control. The issue in question was &quot;race suicide.&quot; Many viewpoints were advocated by those using this slogan, but the most pertinent was the fear that individuals of Yankeee stock, who had lower birth rates than other groups, would be numerically overwhelmed as a result of the fertility of immigrants, nonwhites, and the poor. The leaders of the birth control and women's movements failed to examine the facts that might have convinced them of the irrationality of their position. Overall, the beginning of this century saw birth control, a valuable tool, become a weapon with which to attack the poor and those who were nonwhite. In the 1920s the professionalization of the birth control movement finally crystallized the conservative trend, as women lost their leadership positions in the movement to men. This began the movement's 3rd stage. It set the pattern of physician-dominated clinic programs that still constitute the model for the delivery of birth control services. The stage was set for accusations concerning black genocide when the federal government's entry into the field of subsidized family planning services was tied to the coercive features of the 1967 amendments to the Social Security Act. Little empirical data exist on which segments of the black community agree with the genocide indictment.

Data were collected by administering questionnaires to 122 adolescent participants of the Los Angeles County Supplementary Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. The adolescents were either pregnant or had given birth to a child during the previous 12 month, 2 age cohorts were analyzed. 61 teenagers werein the 13-17 year cohort, and 61 were in the 18-20 year cohort. Each cohort was further subdivided into the 3 categories of less accultured Mexican Americans more acculturated Mexican Americans, and white non-Hispanics. Respondent's predominant use of either Spanish or English was usedto categorize by acculturation level. The 6 subgroups resulting from the age and cultural classifications were compared with reference to demographic characteristics, social networks, contraceptive knowledge and usage, and fertility knowledge. Most of the adolescents in each subgroup lived inhouseholds with annual incomes of less than US $5500, but the proportion of less acculturated Mexican Americans, aged 13-17, living in low income households was higher (82.4%) than for the other subgroups. The less acculturated Mexican Americans in both age groups were more likely to follow the Mexican tradition of marrying if a pregnancy occurred. The percentage among the less acculturated group was 47.4% for those aged 13-17 and 85.0% for those aged 18-20. Respective proportions were 22.7% and 61.9% for the more acculturated group and 0.0% and 45.0% for the non-)hispanic group. Less acculturated Mexican Americans were more likely to discontinue their schooling when they became pregnant than other adolescents. Adolescents in all subgroups tended to come from families which exerted little parental control over adolescent dating behavior. Most of the adolescents in each subgroup relied most heavily on their mothers for emotional support; however, the less acculturated adolescents relied less heavily on their mothers because their mothers frequently resided in Mexico. The less acculturated teenagers relied much less on peers for support than the other subgroups and were somewhat isolated from peer contact. The more acculturated Mexican Americans exhibited a number of traits indicative of adolescents in conflict. They were more knowledgeable about reproduction than other subgroups, but they were less likely to use contraceptives than the other groups. They were also more likely to reject parental guidelines and to have a higher proportion of unplanned pregnancies than the other groups. Findings indicate that acculturation levels should be taken into account in counseling Mexican American adolescents. For less acculturated teenagers, efforts should be made to create a support network of peers and family substitutes. More acculturated teenagers need greater access to contraceptives, and social workers should encourage the members of the adolescent's social network to provide additional support and understanding.",Pregnancy and motherhood among Mexican American adolescents.,1984,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"The collaborative-consultative role of the social worker as a team member in primary-care pediatrics encourages a family-centered approach to health care.

It serves as a guide for intervention, communicates social work concerns to other caregivers, and articulates important features of the patient/family system from an interdisciplinary perspective. The psychosocial evaluation addresses the patient's problems in a historical framework by identifying important developmental features as they pertain to the tasks of dying. It identifies physical resources and needs and evaluates the patient's psychosocial functioning, with particular emphasis on the patient's roles within a family system. Hospice recognizes the uniqueness of each individual as he or she confronts life's final challenge. An adequate psychosocial evaluation brings that uniqueness into focus.",The psychosocial evaluation of the hospice patient.,1983,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"A period of psychological adjustment occurs when a patient switches from hemodialysis to CAPD. The authors have identified four major categories of obstacles that patients must overcome in adjusting to CAPD and its self-care techniques. Ongoing group treatment is a valuable tool for patients in learning coping skills and alternative behaviors during this adjustment period. Members move through stages in the group, from dependence and a feeling of isolation to a stage of struggle for individuation and a work phase. It is in this work phase that group members show increased mutual concern and understanding, personal responsibility, honesty, individuation, a willingness to share and to be open, and coping skills. The value of this progression within the group is that what members learn there can be carried over to patients' lives outside the group. Group therapy can assist CAPD patients in coping with isolation, perceived abandonment by the medical environment, the resurgence of predialysis conflicts, a possible increase in libido, and new areas of family functioning. The process of individuation that occurs in the group has set patients on a course toward increased independent living, closer self-scrutiny, mutual education, vocational and recreational productivity, and an improved ability to deal with the stresses of end-stage renal disease.",Life change: adjusting to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.,1983,UNITED STATES,Health Soc Work"Many parents find their children's entry into adolescence a particularly stressful time.

Common experiences in these agencies suggest the need for an additional orientation to planning. A negotiated-operational orientation that is more closely aligned to the environmental conditions of the social planning experiences is described.

Fifty-five patients, their parents and social workers were interviewed at admission and 60 days later to ascertain: (1) initial attitudes and expectations regarding social work services, (2) specific services desired by clients, (3) actual services provided, and (4) helpfulness of the services. Results indicated that the services most frequently desired were those most often provided. These included providing information to families about patients' progress, helping families deal with hospital procedures and helping with aftercare planning. Most services provided were viewed as helpful. Social workers were seen as more helpful to families than to patients and more so by parents than by patients.

Detailed information about vasectomies is provided and ways are suggested in which clinical social workers can integrate vasectomy counseling into their practice. Men who have had vasectomies generally report that physicians fail to give high priority to preoperative vasectomy counseling. The counseling given is usually in the form of basic information about the surgical procedure, frequently dispensed in a perfunctory manner. The most frequently asked questions about a vasectomy and its potential effects fall into 2 major categories: technical concerns such as how it is done, why, and when; and psychosocial concerns that deal with emotions, attitudes, and beliefs. These 2 categories represent a typology of knowledge about vasectomies that can be integrated into clinical social work. Some of the technical questions about vasectomy are outlined. The attempt is made in the remainder of the discussion to answer these questions as a 1st step in developing an appropriate knowledge base for vasectomy counseling. Additional information regarding vasectomies is presented to provide a holistic and comprehensive view of such counseling. The focus is on the surgical procedure, the psychosocial effects, cultural considerations, informed consent, and clinical practice. Clinical social workers should be involved in prevasectomy decision making and postoperative adjustment. They should have a fundamental knowledge about the medical dynamics of a vasectomy and a complete understanding of individual and family concerns as they relate to choosing vasectomy as a birth control method, and a thorough knowledge of the public's concerns regarding birth control.

The vast majority of states, left free to choose as to the expenditure of their own funds for abortion coverage, have also denied this type of welfare assistance to economically eligible women. The discriminatory effect of the refusal to subsume abortions as part of the Medicaid mandate has been the subject of various legal actions. The constitutionality of that denial is at issue and now awaits Supreme Court determination.Recent Supreme Court and lower court rulings related to induced abortion in the U.S. were reviewed and current issues concerning abortion availability for indigent women were discussed. As a result of the passage of the Hyde Admendment of 1977, limiting Medicaid funding for abortions, indigent women are being denied the freedom to decide whether or not to have an abortion. The Hyde Admendment permits the states to refuse to provide Medicaid funding for abortion except in cases of rape or incest. The Medicaid system was established in 1965 to provide medical care for indigent persons. Middle and upper class women who can afford abortions still have the freedom to decide to have an abortion. Furthermore, most private insurance plans provide abortion coverage. Although economic discrimination is not illegal in the U.S., racial and ethnic discrimination is illegal. Since a disproportionate number of Medicaid patients are members of racial minorities, opponents of the Admindment claim that the legislaton is illegal. Prior to 1977 the Supreme Court rulings reflected a liberal attitude toward abortion. In 1977 the Supreme Court rulings reflected a liberal attitude toward abortion. In 1977 the Supreme Court was expected to affirm the right of indigent women to receive abortion coverage under Medicaid by invoking the 14th Admendment; surprisingly, the Court did not support the rights of these women.

Mothers taking part in the program, when compared with mothers of healthy term infants, had at the time of discharge similar attachment feelings and perception of their infants, as well as similar attitudes toward pregnancy and medical care.",A parents' program in the intensive care nursery: its relationship to maternal attitudes and expectations.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care,Interdisciplinary teaming in primary care: a process of evolution and resolution.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Lung cancer patients were found to score significantly higher on a social isolation scale when compared to a group of patients with other chronic lung diseases as well as to a control group of apparently healthy adults. Social isolation in lung cancer patients did not correlate with their apparent isolation, depression or with their physicians' estimations of their attitudes. Social workers involved in the care of lung cancer patients should be aware that these patients may be actually, if not obviously, socially isolated.",Social isolation in lung cancer patients.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"This paper presents data on 50 alcoholic social workers who had successfully stopped drinking for one year or more. In spite of the fact that these social workers were in many cases visibly in trouble with 63 arrests, 120 inpatient admissions, 13 suicide attempts, and a high reported incidence of addiction to other drugs, they found that collaegues and superiors as well as professionals from whom they sought individual treatment were extremely reluctant to confront the alcoholism problem directly. The authors urge social workers to consider ways of offering help to colleagues in a more systematic manner than is currently available.",The alcoholic social worker: a survey.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health CareCystic fibrosis is a multiple-system chronic disease of genetic origin usually manifested in infancy or early childhood resulting in an abbreviated life span of its victims. Effective management on a daily basis consists of complex regimens which impose a heavy burden on parents. Failure to adhere to them can result in episodes of recurrent lung infection which can further shorten the life span of the patient. The present rate of family breakdown in the United States is a factor that needs to be recognized in the home management of the &quot;CF&quot; patient. This study of 37 families explores the impact of parental relationships on the home care of CF children. Its findings confirm that children living at home with two natural parents received more optimal care and were in better physical condition than those with only one natural parent. This paper suggests guidelines for social work intervention to promote more effective home management of the child with this disease and to counteract when indicated the effect of the loss of traditional parental relationships.,The effect of parental relationships on the management of cystic fibrosis and guidelines for social work intervention.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"This investigation is an exploratory study of parental management of progressive childhood neuromuscular disease. It focuses on parents for their significance as the primary managers of their children's diseases. The study, through its fieldwork component for the collection of data, utilizes participant observation. The researcher lived with each of six families for four days and nights to learn of the main concerns of parents with children who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, and the ways in which the parents manage these concerns. General patterns of positive parental management are defined and are followed by descriptions, in functional terms, of some of the strategies that parents employ to carry out these patterns.",Living with progressive childhood illness: parental management of neuromuscular disease.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"This paper describes a model for developing and testing a screening mechanism to identify high psychosocial risk patient situations in need of early intervention by social workers. Although the criteria developed need further refinement, it was found that multiple criteria are significantly more predictive of high risk than single factors and that three variables, (1) severity of illness: life threatening, (2) severity of illness: physically dysfunctional; and (3) chronic illness were good predictors of need for social work services. It is suggested that similar screening mechanisms be developed and utilized in hospitals throughout the country.",A social work department develops and tests a screening mechanism to identify high social risk situations.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Notwithstanding the current interest in different aspects of admission to psychiatric facilities, the actual procedures for admission have been neglected. Their therapeutic importance is here emphasized using the notion of a therapeutic contract that incorporates patients, families and professionals.

The Harvard Community Health Plan, a health maintenance organization, is examining the effectiveness of an early intervention program in reducing stress-related and inappropriate medical utilization for people after marital separation. The administrative, clinical and supervisory multifunctional role of the social worker within the project is examined. The preventive intervention program is described, as well as the supervision and training of group leaders for the program. Preliminary medical utilization data support the hypothesis that marital separation is associated with increased health care utilization by those experiencing this life stress. More complete analysis of the results of the impact of the program will be detailed in a subsequent paper.",Preventive intervention in an HMO: the social worker's role in a marital separation program.,1980,United States,Soc Work Health Care"An open-ended information/support group program for cancer patients and family members is described. The leadership role of the social work authors in developing the program, facilitating the sessions, adapting it to the limitations of an acute care teaching hospital, coordinating and training the multidisciplinary staff, and dealing with problem behaviors within the group sessions are discussed. Consumer satisfaction survey results are presented. The authors believe the program provides a helpful service to patients and families and a valuable opportunity for staff and students to become more sensitive health professionals through increased understanding of the psychosocial aspects of chronic illness.",A group program for cancer patients and their family members in an acute care teaching hospital.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"Despite the disparate historical evolution, public image, and traditional approached to problem solving characteristic of the social work profession and the field of public health, the potential for professional collaboration has never been greater. Indeed, the comprehensive management of social-health problems demands an interdisciplinary educational program designed to train upcoming professionals. The 4-year old, joint MSW-MPH program at the University of Minnesota provides a setting in which the public health social work student develops the philosophies, values, and skills of both social work and public health, and applies them to appropriate social-health settings. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Minnesota model and examine its implications for faculty and community professionals interested in developing similar training programs.",Public health social work: a training model.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health CareA multidisciplinary team affiliated with a large urban hospital is described and evaluated with respect to its effects on stroke patients. Twenty-six patients who had been referred to the team in a 7-month period were compared with a group of 32 patients who had not been referred to the team. Patients were evaluated on the basis of their scores on a functional health scale mailed to them 3 months after their discharge from the hospital.

Data, which were collected through participant observation in a hospital intensive care unit, show that the structure of the situation can lead to discrepancies in the way that patients and significant others perceive and interpret the illness and therapy. Key variables include differential exposure and access to the care setting, including the care providers, role assignment, and an attenuated communication system.

In some instances they may even fill out prescription blanks that are signed by psychiatrists who do not have the time to see the patients personally. This situation not only represents the abdication of medical responsibility, frequently leaving non-medical personnel with functions beyond their training and professional competence, but also raises important ethical and legal problems. Non-medical professionals in mental health settings should receive appropriate instruction in the essentials of psychopharmacology. Such training should not be left to chance as apparently is the case now. Non-medically trained members of the mental health team, if properly instructed, could cooperate more effectively with the psychiatrists who must in any event retain primary responsibility for pharmacotherapy.",Prescribing psychotropic drugs: whose responsibility?,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"This paper has been a report of a patient attitude survey with 100 randomly selected parents and/or adult patients. It demonstrates that most consumers of our service were pleased with the humaneness and competence of the professional staff. It identified areas of weakness which needed improvement. Constructive action to correct these weaknesses has been initiated. Therefore, this process has demonstrated the value of client feedback for agency operation. It is important to caution the reader that because of the vulnerability of the patients they learn to be accommodating even if unintentional agency practices embarrass and degrade them. The value of patient satisfaction as a measure of the humanism provided by an agency depends on the population being served--their expectations, fears, and hierarchy of concerns.",A social worker's use of a patient attitude survey in the administration of a small health clinic.,1980,United States,Soc Work Health Care,The role of grandparents in adjustment to epilepsy.,1980,United States,Soc Work Health Care,Innovative programs in a health care setting.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care,"Social work identity, competence, and autonomy: the ecological perspective.",1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care"The administration approach described focuses on what staff can do rather than what they cannot do. It is the primary task of administration to bring out whatever strength a social worker possesses and to use each staff member's strength to help other social workers to improve their performance and to grow. The text of administrative achievement is not conformance but performance. The focus of administration must be on opportunities. The organization must be inculcated from the top with the habit of achievement. Social work management must set high standards of performance for itself that are related to the accomplishment of organizational objectives and not the needs of administrators. The administrative track record will include mistakes and failures. The better social work manager will make more mistakes because more new things will be tried. It is an administrative imperative to plan for crises, to make the unanticipated anticipated. The social work director, as architect, using a systems approach, can prepare for crisis and develop long-range plans for the social work program. Dr. Bennett states it well: As scientists and as professional people we would all do well to examine our roles, our motives, our faults, our policies, our prides and our prejudices in the broad context of our evolving society. If we look searchingly, we may finally arrive at a new viewpoint which will enable us to be pragmatic without sacrificing ideals, and hopefully, more humble without sacrificing pride (Bennett, 1978).",Reflections of a social work administrator on the opportunities of crisis.,1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health Care,"Response to &quot;Concepts in the Financial Management of Hospital Social Work Departments&quot; in Social Work i Health Care, Vol. 5(3), Spring 1980.",1980,UNITED STATES,Soc Work Health CareThis paper discusses the potential for the development of a cost accounting procedure that monitors both output of service and costs while allowing for though not insuring quality of output.
