"14","AB","1","In the past decade, the Israeli Ministry of Social Affairs has been engaged in an ongoing effort to change the capacity of social service organizations and social workers across the country to use and create knowledge in order to achieve the best outcomes for the people they serve. Although there is an ever-growing mandate in Israel to demonstrate outcomes and use effective strategies, social workers have historically experienced unique challenges in accessing and assessing available evidence-based practice when they are available. The first step to addressing these challenges, the intra-organizational phase, was to design, implement, and test a model of organizational learning designed to teach social workers how to use learning to change practice. The second step, the inter-organizational phase, was the introduction of virtual communities of practice as a tool to support workers in the acquisition and dissemination of new knowledge. This paper presents a case study of this effort including a description of the development and implementation of the two phases and an agenda for future research.

"40","AB","2","Purpose: Autistic disorder (AD), Asperger’s syndrome (AS), and pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) have been removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–Fifth Edition (DSM-5). It now contains the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis. This study assessed how people with AD and AS felt about the DSM-5 ASD criteria. Method: Phenomenological analysis of discussion forum dialogue among participants (N = 76) with AD and AS was conducted. Results: Discussions demonstrated agreement that the PDD-NOS diagnosis should be removed from the DSM-5. People with AD and AS were concerned about the inclusion of medical or neurobiological research, functioning, reciprocity, and gender bias in the ASD diagnosis. Discussion: Social workers should acknowledge the feelings of people with AD and AS when they use the DSM-5. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

"78","AB","3","Objectives: The study examined social workers’ apprehensions and expectations of the impending adoption of systematically planned, empirically based, outcome-oriented practice (SEOP). Method: Employing a mixed methods longitudinal design, the study used concept mapping to identify and map workers’ apprehensions and expectations and a self-reported questionnaire to measure their levels. Results: Apprehensions were that SEOP will increase monitoring and financial considerations in decision making and undermine professional intervention and professional responsibility. Expectations were that it will (a) empower social workers to provide better service and better cope with counterpressures and (b) systemize work procedures and improve organizational efficiency, effectiveness, and governance. Findings also showed that workers, who participated in formulating the system’s guidelines and principles, reported lower apprehensions and higher expectations than those who did not. Conclusions: In introducing SEOP, it is important to take workers’ apprehensions and expectations into consideration and to include workers in the development stage.

Method: Work products associated with a multiyear demonstration project were subjected to ethnographic analysis. Results: Eligible couples did not see congruence between the program’s goals and their needs, and some were alienated from community agencies. Also, program personnel and the social systems in which they were embedded could not use feedback to change. Conclusions: Recruitment success requires shared goals, good-enough personal relationships to support work on those goals, and subsystem flexibility, throughout the intervention system.

Methods: A total of 839 undergraduate students completed the 240-item Simplified Chinese version of the VIA-IS online. Another 40 students participated in qualitative interviews to examine the meaning and function of the items in Chinese culture. Results: A total of 144 items were removed from the original version questionnaire (240-item) because of low item-loading and lack of cultural validity. A Chinese Virtues Questionnaire-96 (CVQ-96) in simplified Chinese containing 96 items (4 items per strength) was adopted. Three subscales (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) were developed after exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion: A theoretically meaningful 3-factor model of virtue, comparable to some virtue structures proposed in previous studies conducted in Western countries, was obtained. The inventories being developed can facilitate positive social work assessment and intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

Results: Reproducibility agreement is achieved and subscales of the measure are confirmed and show adequate psychometric properties. Conclusions: Findings add support to the CYRM-28 as a reliable and valid self-report instrument that measures three components of resilience processes in the lives of complex needs youth. Advanced statistical modeling yielded evidence that the scale, originally developed for use in various countries, can be used to assess resilience in youth from various ethnocultural backgrounds in Atlantic Canada.

The Association for the Advancement of Social Work with Groups developed Standards for Social Work Practice with Groups, which serve as foundation competencies for professional practice. However, there has been no empirical publication about using them in teaching. This pilot study tested a microskills teaching approach to improve competency in the Standards. Methods: The mixed-methods study used a preexperimental, pretest–posttest design involving 123 diverse baccalaureate and master’s students in introductory group work courses. Student responses about the experience were also collected. Results: There were significant, substantial increases in students’ perceived importance of and confidence in using the Standards. Confidence gain scores were significantly associated with performance in role-plays. Comments about the assignments were highly favorable and identified role-plays as contributing most to learning. Conclusions: The teaching approach advanced Standards-based group work education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

"325","AB","11","Objective: A total of 6 years after displacement by a Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere (HOPE VI) project, this research examines residents who returned to the redeveloped community and residents who decided to keep their vouchers and were living in private sector housing. Respondents were compared on the following variables: application process and decision to move back, satisfaction with housing, material hardships, and perception of economic well-being. Method: The study employed a static group comparison research design. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 56 respondents through five focus groups. Results: Residents who moved back to the revitalized public housing were highly satisfied with their housing, had significantly fewer material hardships, and perceived their economic well-being more positively compared to residents remaining in the voucher program. Conclusions: Our results both support and expand upon previous empirical findings on the complex comparisons between voucher users and revitalized public-housing residents.

"353","AB","12","Objective: A multistage, mixed-methods study using grounded theory with descriptive data was conducted to examine factors in disclosure of intimate partner violence (IPV). Method: In-depth interviews with individuals and focus groups were undertaken to collect data from 98 IPV survivors and service providers to identify influential factors. Quantitative data were also collected on adult trauma levels and child concerns from 20 women. Results: An ecological analysis revealed that IPV disclosure occurs within a complex interplay of distinct individual and environmental considerations. Specific system level factors of the ecological framework—ontogenic, micro, exo, and macro—emerged as influencing disclosure and ultimately shaped womens’ disclosure processes. Conclusion: IPV disclosure remains a ""risky business"" with perceived negative outcomes outweighing benefits. Results reinforce that social work interventions need to occur at all levels of the human ecology in order to provide effective responses.

The first program component was comprised of social–emotional skills training. It focused on improving the social information processing and emotional-regulation skills of children. The second component was a group-based parenting education. It focused on child development and discipline. Method: Participants, recruited from four preschools in high-risk neighborhoods within a large metropolitan area, were assigned to an intervention (n = 31) or a waitlist comparison (n = 36) condition. Using worker ratings and child puppet-play assessments, pretest and posttest data were collected on 14 child and caregiver/parent behaviors. Results: The gain scores of children in the intervention group differed significantly from those in the comparison group on academic competence, social competence, depression, and aggressive behavior. Caretaker gain scores differed significantly, favoring the intervention group on parental bonding, child supervision, communication, and developmental expectations. Conditioned on the limitations of the design, skills training for preschool children and their caregivers appears to promote social and academic skills.

Method: Thematic analysis of 14 focus groups with 105 older, urban African American men. Results: African American men described normative expectations that they did not go to the doctor and that they were afraid to go, with little explanation. When they did go, men reported that they were particularly uncomfortable with the tone physicians used when talking to them. Providers often made recommendations but offered the men little useful information on how to make lifestyle and behavior changes. Following receipt of care, spouses, medical test results, and men's desire to fulfill social roles were key motivating and instrumental factors in following medical advice. Conclusions: African American men's medical help seeking seemed to be negatively influenced by social norms and patient-provider interactions but positively influenced by spouses and the desire to fulfill social roles.

Method: Two focus groups were conducted between 2000 and 2001 in a Midwestern city to understand factors that strengthen and diminish bonds between nonresidential African American fathers and their sons. Results: Results indicate that nonresidential fathers deepened their expressive role commitment by reflecting on socioemotional voids in their paternal relationships and negotiating role strains produced as they weighed giving time versus giving money. Conclusions: Findings support the need to foster expressive role commitment among nonresidential African American fathers as a strategy for enhancing child involvement.

Arguably, the most widely adopted approach, the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) model, is a specialized police-based program designed to improve officers’ ability to safely and effectively respond to mental health crises. Conducting research on CIT is challenging; thus, the evidence base is limited. In this article, the author reviews the emerging literature, present a conceptual model of CIT effectiveness, and describe a study of CIT in Chicago. Findings from Chicago suggest that CIT is increasing linkage to services and reducing use of force in encounters with persons with mental illness. Lessons learned are discussed.

Method: Our iterative intervention development process was guided by a cultural exchange framework and based on findings from an ethnographic study. We piloted this multifamily group 16-session intervention with 59 Latino families in a randomized control trial. Data were collected on family- and client-level outcomes, and poststudy focus groups were conducted with intervention participants. Results: Preliminary evidence indicates that the intervention is effective by increasing illness knowledge and reducing family burden.

Method: The longitudinal pattern of coverage of thirty-three journals categorized in SWA as core journals (published in the 1989-1996 period) is examined. Results: The proportion of issues missing from SWA is significantly greater than 0, increase over time, and is significantly biased in favor of NASW journals. Conclusion: The errors in SWA reported here, combined with those previously reported, will exert a long-term negative impact on scholarship unless their existence becomes known to all SWA users and they take steps to compensate for the situation.

"627","AB","21","Objective: The dynamics of interactions between evidence-based intervention (EBI) developers and trainers and organizations and providers that deliver the EBI was examined in two case studies, a statewide randomized effectiveness trial of an EBI to reduce child neglect and a randomized trial of EBIs for depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in children and adolescents. Methods: Data were collected using ethnographic methods of participant observation and semistructured interviews and analyzed using grounded theory analytic methods. Results: Formal and informal interactions between EBI propagators and end users provide access to resources and exchange of global and local knowledge of service delivery. Productive interactions require accessibility, mutual respect, a shared language, and a willingness to engage in negotiation and compromise to resolve differences in demands imposed by organizational culture, the need for EBI fidelity, and client characteristics. Conclusion: A cultural exchange characterized by information sharing and behavioral change through a process of negotiation and compromise is central to evidence-based practice in youth serving systems of care.

Methods: The implementation model was tested in 53 sites in 8 states. In each site, one of the five EBPs was adopted for implementation and then studied for a 2-year period using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Findings: At baseline, none of the sites had programs attaining high fidelity. Four factors were identified as influencing fidelity: (a) EBP-specific factors, (b) governmental factors, (c) leadership factors, and (d) fidelity review factors. Conclusion: A multipronged implementation strategy was effective in achieving high fidelity in over half of the sites seeking to implement a new EBP.

A qualitative study, with interviews at pre and post, was conducted to evaluate the program’s impact. Data were collected with semistructured interviews from young adults with intellectual disabilities who participated in a college-based residential program and their parents or guardians. Three general themes emerged from the data: Participants reported experiences that were (a) typical of normative life transitions, (b) typical of growing pains associated with significant life transitions and learning new skills, and (c) one step forward. Results indicate that the experience of living away from home for the first time was in some ways comparable to that of a typical college student. Improvement in life skills, including increased awareness of personal goals, enhanced vocational goals, increased maturity or assertiveness, was reported. Respondents were generally satisfied with the program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

Knowledge gained from a qualitative exploration of engagement at one neighborhood-based child welfare agency informed the gathering of quantitative data from 74 different parent-worker dyads in this sequential exploratory design. Seven themes instrumental to engagement emerged: (a) clear, collaborative goal setting; (b) hopefulness; (c) parent acknowledgment of their situations; (d) motivation; (e) respect for cultural differences; (f) honest and straightforward communication; and (g) persistent and timely efforts by all. Quantitative analyses yielded little relationship between engagement and either visitation rate or case disposition by 9 months post placement. Although these data provide support for the clinical benefits of working to improve parent-worker engagement in child welfare services, they fail to provide evidence of a relationship between engagement and improved case outcomes.

The results support our hypothesis that participants who received the RCGS would show a significant increase in their counseling competences. Four primary categories related to supervisory style, supervisory alliance, self-assessment, and supervising outcomes emerge as prominent and consistent from participants' learning experiences. RCGS can be an effective supervision model for participants. Implications of the findings for group supervision and further research are discussed.

A comparison sample of 12 agency youth was used. Results: Findings from independent sample t tests demonstrate that SEI participants displayed significant improvements at 9 months in life satisfaction, family contact, peer support, and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that the SEI was feasible within the agency setting and associated with higher mental health and social outcomes.

Truancy is related to a host of preceding and subsequent risks such as delinquency and limited vocational outcomes. Using participatory research methods, this federally funded, 10-month study assessed youths' perceptions of a publicly funded, faith-based, alternative education program with 73 minority youth participants who were at risk for truancy. The study assessed whether change occurred in peer dynamics, youths' use of time, and educational aspirations. The program was found to have a positive impact on peer dynamics and the use of both school hours and free time. The program supported or did not hamper educational aspiration. Implications about the impact of alternative education programs for at-risk youth and the faith-based nature of the program are discussed.

Method: Due to Internet-related technical difficulties, the response rate could not be precisely determined; however, it was at least 33% and conceivably much higher. Results: Although the large majority (73%) of respondents expressed a favorable view toward EBP, disparities are identified among respondents in both the definition of EBP and views regarding the EBP research hierarchy. Conclusion: Efforts appear to be needed to increase agreement regarding the definition and conceptualization of EBP among educators, with special attention to divergent views regarding what constitutes sufficient evidence to guide practice decisions or to convey that an intervention is evidence-based.

Method: The study used a mixed-method, posttest-only design with two data points. Focus groups with 93 participants combined qualitative, open-ended questions with quantitative measures. Results: Four years after relocation, residents living in homes/apartments found with Section 8 housing vouchers were faring better than residents who moved to other public housing projects. A majority of voucher users believed their house, neighborhood, and overall global living situation had improved since relocation. In the year between the first and second wave of focus groups, 40% of voucher users had moved to a new house/apartment. Moving was associated with residents perceiving their situations improving in many categories. Implications: Our findings suggest HOPE VI developments are more likely to accomplish their objectives if the current administration continues full funding of the voucher program rather than implements the cutbacks it is currently proposing.

Results: The results indicated after a year in the program, foster families increased their frequency of computer use, confidence in using computers and the Internet, and frequency of e-mail with social workers. Parents and foster children perceived the program to be useful in improving children's technology skills, homework, grades, and interest in technology-related careers.

This article describes the development, psychometric analysis, and validation of the African American Respect Scale, a 20-item instrument measuring prosocial attitudes held by male adolescents. Method: The scale was administered to 200 African American male youth age 14 to 18 years; 100 were incarcerated in juvenile corrections facilities, 100 resided in the community. Results: After acceptable reliability was established, factor analysis revealed three principal components labeled societal, family, and peer subscales. The subscales correlated with racial socialization and predicted the use of violence. Nonincarcerated youth scored significantly higher on all three subscales than incarcerated youth. Conclusions: Suggestions for social work practice with African American youth include assessing their attitudes toward respect, and assisting them to handle disrespect without resorting to violence.

Results: Both the collaborative method and the infusion of technology were central to the functioning of collaboratory projects and, ultimately, the translation from research to practice and policy. The community-based participatory nature of the research projects resulted in applicable findings that were credible with people affected by the issues studied. Conclusions: The present study suggests that when there is steadfast commitment on the pan of a diverse group of partners, even simple applications of technology can make a difference.

Method: Qualitative interviews obtained in the context of a mixed-methods study were conducted with 38 adult female survivors of childhood sexual abuse. Results: Two major differences in outcomes between the two treatment approaches were observed. There were considerable distinctions between the two treatment groups in terms of the importance and effect of the client-therapist relationship, and in terms of the depth of change reportedly caused by the different therapies. Conclusions: Survivors' narratives indicate that EMDR produces greater trauma resolution, while within eclectic therapy, survivors more highly value their relationship with their therapist, through whom they learn effective coping strategies.

"1215","AB","42","The present study provides information on the reliability and validity of the Transracial Adoption Parenting Scale (TAPS), a multidimensional 36-item Likert-type scale that measures cultural competence among transracial adoptive (TRA) parents. The TAPS was theoretically developed and refined through feedback from experts in TRA adoption. A cross-sectional survey design was used with a national nonprobability sample of 1,411 TRA parents. Each parent completed the 53-item TAPS and three other instruments with which to examine criterion and construct validity. After a preliminary factor analysis of the 53-item TAPS, the authors found that 36 items were retained in six factors. The 36-item TAPS had excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.91), concurrent and discriminant validity were supported. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the TAPS holds promise of being a psychometrically sound instrument with which to measure cultural competence among TRA parents. Further investigation is warranted.

Method: A sample of 287 licensed social workers completed a mailed survey containing the STSS and other relevant survey items. Results: Evidence was found for reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and factorial validity. Conclusions: The STSS fills a need for reliable and valid instruments specifically designed to measure the negative effects of social work practice with traumatized populations. The instrument may be used to undertake empirical investigation into the prevention and amelioration of secondary traumatic stress among social work practitioners.

Results: Factor analysis revealed six subscale factors in the initial scale development composed of 43 items, accounting for 76% of the variance with excellent internal reliabilities. The six subgroup factors were moderately correlated. Conclusions: Given the reliability and validity of the scale, it may be useful in agency settings to evaluate and measure social workers' confidence in treating clients who have alcohol and other drug problems.

Method: The study employed a one-group pretest/posttest design, with 12-monthfollow-up data, to investigate changes in Domestic Violence Inventory (DVI) scores among 91 men, 57% African American, court ordered into a BIP. Results: Analysis indicated that (a) court-ordered batterers demonstrate significant changes, in the desired direction, on psychological variables related to domestic violence, as a result of participation in a court-mandated BIP and (b) there was no significant difference in changes on these psychological variables between African American and Caucasian batterers. Conclusion: Implications of the findings for enhancing intervention efforts with court-ordered batterers were discussed.

"1321","AB","46","Objective: Existing studies of lay explanations of poverty in the social work literature are plagued with methodological problems. The psychometric properties of the 13-item Chinese Perceived Causes of Poverty Scale (CPCPS), which assessed four categories of explanations of poverty, were examined. Method: Chinese parents and their adolescent children from 229 families experiencing economic hardship were asked to respond to the CPCPS. Results: Results consistently showed that four factors were abstracted from the scale: Personal Problems, Exploitation, Lack of Opportunity, and Fate. The four related subscales were also found to be internally consistent, and there was some support for their construct validity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the CPCPS possesses sound psychometric properties. The findings also point out the importance of empirically demonstrating the existence of measures assessing different constructs when social work practitioners and researchers examine lay explanations of poverty.

Research suggests that whereas many assisted living residents experience depression, few receive needed mental health services. Objective: Examine the effectiveness of a group treatment program in promoting the psychological well-being of depressed assisted living elders. Method: Seventeen elders participated in 10 group therapy sessions that combined remotivation and supportive therapy techniques. Pre- and posttest measures and a program satisfaction survey were administered by research assistants. Results: Following the conclusion of the twice weekly sessions, participants experienced a significant decrease in depressive symptoms and a significant increase in life satisfaction and perceived social support.
