"29","AB","1","Objective: This study examined the validity and reliability of a person-directed care (PDC) measure for nursing homes in Korea. Method: Managerial personnel from 223 nursing homes in 2010 and 239 in 2012 were surveyed. Results: Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis for the first sample generated a 33-item PDC measure with eight factors. Item analysis for the second sample resulted in 32 items. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the acceptability of the revised instrument with seven factors of 30 items (χ2 = 650.96, root mean square error of approximation = .059, nonnormed fit index = .88, comparative fit index = .90, and incremental fit index = .90). The overall scale had high internal consistency and reliability (α = .925). Conclusion: Findings from this study confirm the validity of the revised Korean PDC scale.

"78","AB","2","Objective: This research examines the psychometric properties of two subscales of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD) Multicultural Council’s Organizational Cultural Competence Assessment, which together have been used to assess organizational cultural competence in child welfare agencies. Method: Confirmatory factor analysis was utilized to analyze data on 478 child welfare workers. Results: Six models were generated based upon the theoretical literature. The best-fitting model was unidimensional (χ² = 13.18, df = 9, p = .15; root mean square error of approximation = 0.03; comparative fit index = 0.99; Tucker–Lewis Index = 0.99). Discussion and applications to social work: Factors that are more proximal to client interaction were stronger indicators of organizational cultural competence than those that were more distal. Those wishing to examine organizational cultural competence in voluntary child welfare settings should consider using the validated form of the AUCD instrument.

"128","AB","3","Objectives: This study is the first review to be conducted to evaluate measures of wandering behavior for identifying people with dementia at risk of getting lost. Method: Drawing upon systematic review search strategies, the relevant literature was reviewed for wandering instruments using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The psychometric properties of these were evaluated with reference to establishing the risk of getting lost. Results: The search yielded 34 instruments. Of these, one wandering-specific measure and four measures of behavioral change in dementia met inclusion criteria. The ability of these to confidently evaluate the risk of getting lost remains uncertain. Conclusion: Further research is required to more fully evaluate the psychometric properties of the retrieved instruments. This process is made complex by difficulties in defining wandering and getting lost and methodologically, by the absence of a criterion reference. Methodological developments are required to enhance assessment-focused reviews in the psychosocial intervention field. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

"203","AB","4","Objective: Little empirical attention has been paid to the validity scales of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC). The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of cases identified by the validity scales and its analytical impact. Methods: The current study compares regression models using data from two community samples (n = 3,724 and n = 2,245) and two samples of at-risk youth (n = 1,758 and n = 204). Using Chow tests to compare coefficients, we demonstrate the implications of removing cases identified by the TSCC validity scales. Results: The Underresponse (UND) scale identified 8% of the community sample and 20% of the at-risk sample. Chow tests revealed significant group differences based on the UND scale for all TSCC subscales. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the analytical impact of the TSCC validity scales and provides statistical evidence for the removal of invalid cases.

Method: Social workers employed at 22 Swedish child protections agencies participated in the data collection. Both classic test theory approaches and Rasch analysis were used. Seventy-five (46 double) protocols of the Early Childhood version and 65 (43 double) protocols of the Middle Childhood version were obtained. Results: The interobserver reliability and Rasch reliability displayed acceptable results. Targeting was satisfying for the middle and more adequate home environments. However, there were mixed results concerning model fit. Conclusion: The scores may be used to identify families with inadequate home environments where children may be at risk.

An alternative weighting method is provided. Method: Analyze data from a client satisfaction survey of 103 clients of a publicly funded elderly case management service unit located in a large U.S. Midwest region city. Results: The alternative weighted score correlated higher with all the global client satisfaction measures than the multiplicative score. Conclusion: Using multiplicative scores to represent global client satisfaction should be avoided. The proposed alternative weighting method is a reasonable way to incorporate perceived importance to represent global client satisfaction.

Methods: A confirmatory factor analysis was performed on data of 117 children in Dutch residential youth care. Reliability analysis was performed and concurrent validity was tested. Results: An adequate fit of a two-factor model indicated construct validity of the GCIC 8-15. Reliability coefficients were good, and a significant correlation between perceived group climate and treatment motivation supported concurrent validity. Discussion: The GCIC 8-15 can be used to identify positive and negative aspects of group climate in residential youth care and enables further group climate research with children.

"445","AB","8","Purpose: This article describes the development and validation of the Undergraduate Perceptions of Poverty Tracking Survey (UPPTS). Method: Data were collected from 301 undergraduates at a small university in the Northeast and analyzed using exploratory factor analysis augmented by random qualitative validation. Results: The resulting survey contains 39 questions and has six factors that meet empirical standards for validity and reliability. The UPPTS provides information regarding undergraduate students’ perceptions of those living in poverty in three areas: (1) general attitudes toward those living in poverty, including a sense of the students’ underlying explanation for why someone may be poor; (2) understanding of and empathy for those living in poverty; and (3) commitment to addressing poverty via direct action or support for programs/services that aid those in poverty. Discussion: The UPPTS builds upon the concepts of a lack of social empathy and cognitive distancing as principal reasons why people fail to do more to help the poor via either direct action or support for programs that will aid the poor. Further, social work and other educators may use the UPPTS to guide their efforts in poverty education and to track the progress of their efforts with undergraduate students.

"502","AB","9","Objective: Professional social workers and emergency workers operating in war contexts may develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following exposure to traumatic events. Impact of trauma must be accurately assessed by researchers via robust models of measurement. In this article, measurement models for the 13-item Children’s Revised Impact of Event scale (CRIES-13), Arabic version were assessed in an adult population operating in a war context. Method: A sample (N = 218) of in-service adult Palestinian helpers was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Findings supported adoption of a bidimensional model comprising two normally distributed measures labeled intrusion and avoidance as a quantitative screening tool for PTSD in contexts of military violence. Conclusion: The solid psychometric properties of CRIES in an adult population suggest its use as a short version of the Impact of Event scale–Revised (IES), Arabic version (IES-R-13).

"567","AB","10","A number of proxies have been used in child welfare workforce research to represent actual turnover; however, there have been no psychometric studies to validate a scale specifically designed for this purpose. The Intent to Leave Child Welfare Scale is a proxy for actual turnover that measures workers’ intention to leave. This scale was validated in the current study by a CFA. The resulting factors were compared to actual turnover. Nearly two in three workers who indicated that they had considered looking for a job in the past year actually left their agencies (60.0%). A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the Intent to Leave Child Welfare Scale. The best fitting model consisted of three factors with acceptable fit statistics (X 2 = 28.6, p = 0.04; RMSEA = 0.05, 90% RMSEA CI = 0.01-0.08; CFI = 0.99; TLI = 0.98). Identified latent factors included “thinking,” which included observed variables related to workers thinking about leaving their current jobs; “looking,” which included observed variables related to workers searching for a new job; and “acting,” which included observed variables related to workers actually taking physical steps to seek a new job. Once a good fitting model was identified, binary logistic regression was conducted to determine odds ratios to predict who actually left their agencies. Each of the identified latent factors was significantly predictive of actual leaving (thinking: OR = 1.24, p = 0.00; looking: OR = 1.25, p = 0.00; acting: OR = 1.28, p = 0.01).

This study aims to validate the Transgression-related Interpersonal Motivations Inventory in marital relationships within a Chinese context (C-TRIM). Method: Data were collected from 665 married individuals in Hong Kong who completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results: It is suggested that C-TRIM is a one-factor scale consisting of 12 items. It is also found that C-TRIM and benevolence are two distinct dimensions in measuring forgiveness in a marriage. C-TRIM represents negative forgiveness, whereas benevolence refers to positive forgiveness. Conclusion: C-TRIM demonstrates to be a valid and reliable scale with which to assess the forgiveness level of individuals toward their offending partner in Chinese communities.

"690","AB","12","Objectives: The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Chinese Virtues Questionnaire (CVQ). The reliability, factor structure, construct validity, and temporal stability of the inventory were examined. Method: A university student sample (n = 878) and a working adult sample (n = 153) were recruited. Participants were asked to complete the paper-and-pencil CVQ and a set of questionnaires to measure both their positive and negative psychological status. Results: The results supported the three-factor structure of the CVQ established earlier. Factorial invariants were found in different subsamples (students vs. workers; male vs. female). Each factor (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency (α = .87 to .92), test–retest reliability (r = .70 to .76), convergent validity, discriminant validity, incremental validity, temporal stability, and theoretical significance. Conclusions: The questionnaire with good psychometric characteristics and solid cultural foundations can facilitate positive social work assessment and intervention.

Methods: The CBA was administered in a sample of 275 Chinese parents experiencing economic disadvantage. Results: The CBA was found to be internally consistent. Consistent with the conceptual framework, factor analyses showed that two stables factors were abstracted from the scale. The scale and subscale scores of the CBA showed correlation with parental attributional beliefs of children’s success and failure to effort and luck, respectively, thus supporting the construct validity of the measures. Conclusions: The CBA is a reliable and valid measurement tool to measure Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity from the perspective of parents in the context of poverty.

"808","AB","14","Objective: This study examines the factor structure of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18; Derogatis, 2001) in a hard-to-reach population of mainly undocumented migrant Latino day laborers. While, the BSI-18 has been found to be a valid and reliable measure of psychological distress, cross-cultural assessments in sub-groups of Latinos are scarce with this being the first study to examine the factor structure of the Spanish version of the BSI-18 with this population. Methods: A series of principal axis exploratory factor analytic procedures examining one to three-factor models were performed with a street recruited sample of 150 Latino migrant day laborers. Results: A one-factor model emerged and four items were dropped due to low factor loadings. The internal consistency coefficients for the 14-item BSI was α = .87. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the revised BSI-18 appears to measure a single dimension of general somatic-psychological distress in this sample of Latinos.

Objectives: This study examined the psychometric properties of the Family, School, and Peer Influence on Volunteerism scale (FSPV) among Chinese adolescents. The FSPV is an instrument that assesses the perceived influence of these social systems on adolescent volunteerism. There are nine identical items for each of the three systems. Method: The FSPV was administered to 2,819 early adolescents in Hong Kong. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed four factors, namely, ""Family,"" ""School,"" ""Peer,"" and ""Extrinsic influence."" The FSPV also demonstrated good internal consistency, construct validity, and criterion-related validity. Conclusion: The psychometric properties of FSPV are adequate in the assessment of the perceived influence of social systems on volunteer service participation in Chinese adolescents.

"973","AB","17","Objectives: The concept of recovery has begun shifting mental health service delivery from a medical perspective toward a client-centered recovery orientation. This shift is also beginning in Hong Kong, but its development is hampered by a dearth of available measures in Chinese. Method: This article translates two measures of recovery (mental health recovery measure and the recovery subscale of peer outcomes protocol) and one measure of recovery-promoting environments (recovery self-assessment) into Chinese and investigates their psychometric properties among 206 Hong Kong Chinese people with severe mental illness. Result: Multifactor solutions from earlier studies were not replicated; our evidence pointed to one-factor solutions. Since all recovery measures demonstrated high internal consistency reliability (.92 to .96), we analyzed total scale scores. Conclusion: Moderately high correlations among the recovery measures (.33 to .56) provide some support for construct validity, yet further investigation of recovery measures in a Chinese population is needed.

Background: Filial piety, a term used to describe a set of family values in relation to parental care. This is the first measure of this construct for use with Arab populations in Israel. Method: A random sample of 250 informal Arab caregivers field tested a new AFPS (26 items in a 5-point Likert-type format).Validity and reliability tests were applied. Results: Principal component factor analysis extracted seven factors, which accounted for 58.8% of the variance: sacrifice; obligation; respect; face-saving; repay; intergenerational exchange; and family unity. The overall scale reliability was high (.83) with strong construct validity. Conclusions: The results support the unidimensional structure of the AFPS.

In Study 3, data based on 3,649 secondary school students were analyzed. Findings support the internal consistency, concurrent validity, and discriminant and construct validity of the scales in different samples. In contrast to the proposal that there are 7 dimensions in the scale, 3 stable factors could be extracted from the Chinese version, and the related subscales had adequate internal consistency, temporal stability, and construct and discriminant validity in different samples. It is concluded that the Chinese device possesses good psychometric properties, although its factor structure might differ from that based on the original English version.

Method: Students (n = 331) completed surveys anonymously. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted and group differences analyzed. Results: Content validity was established conceptually, and preliminary discriminant validity was established statistically. Factor analyses suggest a shortened 19-item measure (α = .92) with two subscales. Convergent validity was established by comparing the scores on the IAH and another measure of antigay bias. Groups differed on sex, age, religiosity, parenthood, race, and childhood urbanicity. Conclusion: The revised IAH demonstrates sound psychometric properties. It can be useful to evaluate antigay bias, it can prompt discussion, and it can be used as an outcome measure in intervention studies.

Developed by the Association for the Advancement of Social Work with Groups, the Standards have not been widely used. An instrument based on the Standards can help advance evidence-based teaching and practice. Methods: Items were drawn from the Standards yielding a 70-item inventory measuring two domains for each item: how important the item is for successful group work and how confident the respondent is about demonstrating the skill in practice. Psychometric testing involved 426 mostly students. Results: The alpha for both the importance and the confidence subscales was .98, with low standard errors of measurement. Developed directly from the Standards, the inventory had prima facie content validity, further supported by expert ratings. Significant correlations between the subscales and validators supported a range of validity analyses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

Method: Classical measurement theory and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were utilized with an a priori theory and factor model to validate the SPSLI. Results: A 15-item scale containing five subscales (intensity, extensity, purity, adequacy, and duration) showed good fit, statistically significant factor loadings, good reliability, and validity. Multigroup CFA indicated both measurement equivalence and structural equivalence between males and females. Discussion: The SPSLI supports Sorokin’s multidimensional theory of love and provides clinicians a method to measure love actions of divorcing individuals. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

"1370","AB","24","Objective: The purpose of this study was to validate the 10-item DSSI as a brief measure of social support for use in diverse adult populations. Methods: EFA was performed on 2010 Arizona Health Survey (AHS) data (n = 8215). Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) then confirmed the factors structure by gender, ethnicity, and age, as well as for the total population. DSSI-10 and subscales were compared with variables related to social support. Results: CFI confirms this structure exhibits a good model fit. Low self-reported health status and low self-reported quality of life were related to lower DSSI scores. Living alone was significantly negatively related to the DSSI-10. Conclusions: Researchers may confidently use DSSI-10 to measure social support for diverse adult populations. This instrument can be used in epidemiological studies to increase understanding of mental and physical health in relationship to social supports in the general population.

Method: The COSCE’s development involved the creation of a cyber-counseling performance rating scale and two simulated client scenarios, and the recruitment and training of three raters. The COSCE was tested on six masters of social work students and six seasoned cyber-counseling practitioners. Results: We examined the COSCE’s internal consistency, interrater reliability, and interclient reliability. In addition, we assessed the construct validity through exploratory factor analysis and known-groups validation method. Conclusions: With further improvement, the COSCE can be a reliable and valid tool in assessing the competence of cyber-counseling practitioners.

Method: A nationally randomized sample of 2,400 surveys was sent to self-identified trauma treatment specialists, and 711 (29.6%) were returned. Results: An exploratory factor analysis (N = 319) conducted on a randomly split sample (RSS) revealed a 19-item, six-factor structure. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for the six-factor model on the second RSS (N = 320). The hypothesized model demonstrated adequate fit (comparative fit index [CFI] = .94 and root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .07). Post hoc modifications significantly improved model fit (CFI = .95 and RMSEA = .06). Alpha reliabilities ranged from .72 to .82. Conclusions: The TPQ has evidence of validity for assessing trauma practice patterns among clinical social workers and clinical psychologists.

"1540","AB","27","Objectives: The Employment Hope scale (EHS) was designed to measure the empowerment-based self-sufficiency (SS) outcome among low-income job-seeking clients. This measure captures the psychological SS dimension as opposed to the more commonly used economic SS in workforce development and employment support practice. The study validates the EHS and reports its psychometric properties. Method: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using an agency data from the Cara Program in Chicago, United States. The principal axis factor extraction process was employed to identify the factor structure. Results: EFA resulted in a 13-item two-factor structure with Factor 1 representing ""Psychological Empowerment"" and Factor 2 representing ""Goal-Oriented Pathways."" Both factors had high internal consistency reliability and construct validity. Conclusions: While findings may be preliminary, this study found the EHS to be a reliable and valid measure, demonstrating its utility in assessing psychological SS as an empowerment outcome among low-income jobseekers.

Method: The CYRM-28 was administered to two groups of concurrent service using youth in Atlantic Canada (n₁ = 497; n₂ = 410) allowing for use of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: Reproducibility agreement is achieved and subscales of the measure are confirmed and show adequate psychometric properties. Conclusions: Findings add support to the CYRM-28 as a reliable and valid self-report instrument that measures three components of resilience processes in the lives of complex needs youth. Advanced statistical modeling yielded evidence that the scale, originally developed for use in various countries, can be used to assess resilience in youth from various ethnocultural backgrounds in Atlantic Canada.

"1650","AB","29","Empathy is a core principle essential to social work. Despite this emphasis, minimal empirical research of empathy has been undertaken by social work researchers. The purpose of this study was to develop and initially validate the Empathy Scale for Social Workers (ESSW). The ESSW is a 41-item self-report inventory designed to assess empathy in social work practitioners. The sample (N = 271) consisted of social workers who had attained the Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. Findings revealed promising psychometric properties for the ESSW, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) demonstrated content, construct, and factorial validity. Results were encouraging and they lay the ground work for the continued development of the ESSW. This scale addresses a gap in social work knowledge regarding the empirical evaluation of empathy. Results have implications for social work as the scale may be used to assess student training needs and/or as a screening tool for social work supervisors and practitioners.

The underlying factor structure of the IVRS was tested by the exploratory factor analysis (Principal Axis Factoring), which identifies the four factors: partner blame, distal blame, minimization, and violence recognition. The internal consistency of the four subscales of the 20-item IVRS had an acceptable-to-good coefficient alpha ranging from .75 to .83. Evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity was established through correlational analyses. The initial findings of this study support that the IVRS is a reliable and valid self-reporting instrument that measures attitudes related to responsibility for violent behavior toward the intimate partner. Implications for practice and future research are specified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

Thus, this article describes the development and initial validation of two scales, Human Rights Engagement in Social Work (HRESW) and Human Rights Exposure in Social Work (HRXSW). Method: The scales were validated using a purposive sample of 287 social work students. Results: Factor analysis supported a 25-item HRESW and an independent 11-item HRXSW. Reliability was assessed: HRESW (α = .894) and HRXSW (α = .734). Conclusions: The HRESW and the HRXSW have direct applicability to social work education. Through measuring exposure and engagement, we can begin assessing the quality of human rights education in social work.

"1883","AB","33","Objectives: The present study examined the factorial invariance and functional equivalence of the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths (VIA-IS) among the Chinese. Methods: A total of 839 undergraduate students completed the 240-item Simplified Chinese version of the VIA-IS online. Another 40 students participated in qualitative interviews to examine the meaning and function of the items in Chinese culture. Results: A total of 144 items were removed from the original version questionnaire (240-item) because of low item-loading and lack of cultural validity. A Chinese Virtues Questionnaire-96 (CVQ-96) in simplified Chinese containing 96 items (4 items per strength) was adopted. Three subscales (interpersonal, vitality, and cautiousness) were developed after exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Conclusion: A theoretically meaningful 3-factor model of virtue, comparable to some virtue structures proposed in previous studies conducted in Western countries, was obtained. The inventories being developed can facilitate positive social work assessment and intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the S-PSSS Family (SSfa) and Friends (SSfr) subscales. Method: Because of their common coping method of social support, a cross-sectional sample of Alzheimer’s caregivers was relevant for this evaluation. Self-reported data were collected from 229 participants at two caregiver conferences. Results: Factor analysis on each measure indicated a three-factor solution with all items loaded. Reliability was satisfactory. Correlational analyses and odds ratios indicated preliminary construct validity for SSfa and SSfr. Conclusion: The S-PSSS subscales appear to be psychometrically appropriate for potential use in appraising family and friend support among Alzheimer’s caregivers.

"2050","AB","36","Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are more common in severe mental illnesses (SMI) clients than in the general population, yet brief screens for detecting probable PTSD in SMI clients are nonexistent. In a two-part study, the authors used correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to develop and validate a 3-item PTSD scale derived from the PTSD Symptom scale (PSS) with SMI clients. Results from Study #1 (N = 220) revealed that a 3-item Brief PSS showed excellent accuracy for detecting PTSD, good internal consistency, and good concurrent validity with other relevant measures. In Study #2 (N = 327) comparable reliability and concurrent validity were found with measures similar to those used in Study #1. Practitioners are encouraged to use the Brief PSS with SMI clients, and if positive, conduct a full assessment and diagnosis. Limitations of the study include the lack of a structured interview for primary Axis I diagnosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

CIHS is an instrument that assesses Chinese cultural influence on helping other people. Method: The CIHS was administered to 5,812 high school students in Hong Kong. Results: The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed three factors, namely, ""Advantages of helping people,"" ""Disadvantages of helping people,"" and ""Self-centeredness,"" which support the hypothesized dimensions. The CIHS demonstrated good internal consistency. Construct validity and criterion-related validity were also supported. Conclusions: The psychometric properties of CIHS are adequate in the assessment of cultural influence on helping in Chinese adolescent samples.

Method: A new online evaluation tool was designed to address several of the problems associated with previous methods of evaluation, and was tested on 190 field instructor–student pairs. Results: Results demonstrated feasibility of the tool, high acceptability from students and faculty, high internal consistency, and clearly reduced ceiling effect, when compared with a traditional competency-based evaluation (CBE) tool. It did, however, continue to result in a strong skew toward positive evaluation and did not increase the identification of students at risk. Conclusions: The online PBE tool demonstrates promise in redressing some of the evaluation issues posed by the previous CBE model of evaluation.

"2214","AB","39","Objective: The objective of this study was to test the factor structure of the parent version of the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS) in a sample of mothers who brought their children for community mental health (CMH) services (n = 280). Method: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the fit of the hypothesized four-factor structure and the empirically validated one-factor structure. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify what factor structure best fit our sample of distressed mothers. Results: Neither the one- nor the four-factor model fit our sample. The EFA suggested that the CIS was best understood as a 12-item, three-factor model that identified functional impairment: (a) at school/work; (b) in socializing; and (c) at home/family. Conclusion: These findings call into question the construct validity of the parent version of the CIS in a CMH sample of mothers and provide support for multidimensional measures of functional impairment.

This article reports the development and psychometric properties of a Chinese-version of MGLQ. Methods: An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using maximum likelihood extraction with varimax rotation was conducted to identify the factor structure of the MGLQ. Results: A two-factor solution was identified with Factor 1 representing ""Attachment to Homeland"" and Factor 2 representing ""Identify Discontinuity."" Both factors had excellent internal consistency reliability and concurrent validity as demonstrated by predicted relationships with depression scores. Conclusions: This study supported the validity and the reliability of the MGLQ, demonstrating its utility in assessing the migratory grief experience among immigrants.

Method: Using the model of Boykin and Tom on Black family socialization, the items were developed and validated using two different Asian adoptee samples. Results: Two subscales, ethnic socialization and racial socialization, were identified through principal axis factor (PAF) analysis. The ERSTAS and its subscales demonstrate strong internal consistency as well as discriminant validity and correlate significantly with ethnic identity measures. Although the racial socialization subscale was significantly related to self-esteem and depression, the total scale and the Ethnic Socialization subscale scores were not. Conclusions: The ERSTA is a relatively short, easy-to-use, and theoretically developed measure. The initial psychometric properties of the scale highlight its utility within the transracial adoptee group. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

"2393","AB","42","Objectives: This article describes two studies related to the development of the Perceived School Experiences Scale (PSES). The PSES may be used by social workers to assess youths’ perceptions of three school-related protective factors, including school connectedness, academic press, and academic motivation. Method: In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory analyses were conducted on a calibration (n = 386) and cross-validation sample (n = 387) of middle and high school students. In Study 2, test–retest reliability and predictive validity were established on a sample of high school students (n = 97). Results: The resultant 14-item PSES demonstrated acceptable factorial validity and gender invariance in samples of middle and high school students. The PSES also demonstrated acceptable test–retest reliability, and correlated positively with perceived belonging and social competence. Conclusions: Overall, the PSES has important implications for social workers as they assess important protective factors and document the effectiveness of their interventions for the children and youth they serve.

Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using Mplus and weighted least squares means and variances adjusted (WLSMV) estimation took into account the ordinal and clustered nature of the data. Models were tested on four random subsamples. Results using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation are presented for comparison. Results: A five-factor, first-order model demonstrated superior fit. Scores from the five scales demonstrated acceptable reliability. Conclusions: Results suggest the ESSP for Teachers provides school practitioners with quality data to guide intervention choices in schools. Implications for future research are discussed.

"2516","AB","44","Objective: The McKinney-Vento Act (MVA) is the primary federal policy addressing homelessness in America with specific mandates designed to ameliorate the effects homelessness has on educational attainment for school-age children. The extent to which this policy is implemented may have far-reaching effects for homeless children. The MVA Implementation Scale (MVAIS) was developed for the purpose of providing a tool for assessing school-based social services personnel’s perceived knowledge and awareness of implementation of the MVA within their service areas. This study tests the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the 26-item instrument. Method: Data were collected from a purposive sample of school social workers (N = 201) attending a Mid-Western regional conference in order to examine the reliability and the validity of this measure. Results: The hypothesized factor structures were confirmed. Findings also indicated high levels of reliability among items, as well as initial evidence of instrument validity. Conclusion: Findings from this study indicate that the MVAIS adequately measures participant’s perceived implementation of the MVA. Future implications for research and practice are discussed.

"2571","AB","45","Purpose: Student-mothers from low-income families are three times as likely to drop out of college as female students without children. Yet, the economic and social benefits of postsecondary education for low-income mothers underscore the importance of examining environmental barriers to completing college for these women. Methods: The intent of this study, therefore, is to develop and validate an instrument, the school support scale, aimed at measuring the perception of emotional and tangible college support among student-mothers from low-income families. Results: Findings show excellent reliabilities for emotional (α = .944) and tangible (α = .888) subscales and indicate that student-mothers who perceive faculty and staff as supportive tend to have strong commitments to the institution (p = .01). Applications: The 22-item scale can be used as an “early-warning” tool for college counselors and administrators to support student-mothers in identifying and removing barriers that contribute to problems associated with college retention of low-income mothers.

Method: A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in order to evaluate the factor structure of the NFS. Results: A final, 8-item model, with two error covariances yielded the best fit of the NFS in the current sample. These findings suggest that, with some modification, the NFS is a very promising, short measure of perceived father nurturance that is applicable to African American youth from various family structures and who have varying amounts of interaction with their fathers while growing up.

Method: Social work practitioners, psychologists and LMFTs (N = 1001) were surveyed to assess the scale’s internal consistency reliability and criterion and factorial validity. Results: Findings support the scale’s internal consistency reliability, criterion and factorial validity. Conclusion: These findings support the use of the shorter version of the EBPPAS scale in surveys or to evaluate efforts to educate a wide range of behavioral health practitioners in EBP.

A 51-item scale was developed to assess both the component processes and outcomes of recovery. A sample of 471 participants administered the questionnaire. The factor analysis yielded a 45-item scale with six subscales, including three components of process and three outcomes. The construct validity was confirmed. Each subscale has very good internal consistency (α = .80—.95), and the 3—5 weeks test—retest reliability was .72. The scale could significantly differentiate the rehabilitation sample and the better functioning sample. The results indicated four stages of recovery. The external construct validity was also ensured. The results supported the psychometric property of the Stages of Recovery Scale (SRS). It could be utilized for both assessment and evaluation to document the evidence of a recovery-oriented program, collectively or individually.

"2811","AB","49","The authors report a validation study of the Teen Court Peer Influence Scale (TCPIS), a newly developed scale, to examine its factor structure, reliability, and evidence of validity. Methods: The scale was disseminated to 202 participants in six teen courts in the state of Florida, and the authors conducted exploratory factor analyses. Content validity was established conceptually and evidence of concurrent validity, convergent construct validity, and discriminant construct validity were established statistically. Results: Factor analyses suggest that positive peer influence is operationalized by three constructs: positive cognitions/expectations, positive identity development, and modeling/imitation. The TCPIS has good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s alpha of .90. Conclusions: The TCPIS shows preliminary evidence of sound psychometric properties and may be used to inform teen court policy and practice.

Method: Social work practitioners and second-year master of social works (MSW) students (N = 511) were surveyed in four sites to assess the scale’s internal consistency reliability and criterion and factorial validity. Additional data on the scale’s criterion validity and sensitivity were gathered in pretests and posttests of 97 social workers participating in EBP continuing education workshops. Results: Findings support the scale’s internal consistency reliability, criterion and factorial validity, and sensitivity. Conclusion: These findings support the use of the scale in surveys or to evaluate efforts to educate students and practitioners in EBP.

Methods: Exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) procedures are used to validate the APQ with 790 parents of children, ages 6-10. Results: Three subscales emerged representing parenting practices associated with child behavior management (positive reinforcement, positive discipline, and negative discipline). CFA fit indices indicated adequate fit with the model, with all items loading significantly on their respective factors. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the APQ can be used to measure parenting practices associated with child behavior management among parents of children, ages 6-10.

In the original article an incorrect item was reported in Table 4. Item # 4 (Factor 3), ""Male sex offenders should be punished more severely than female sex offenders"" should have read ""A lot of sex offenders use their victims to create pornography."" Also, items 1, 4, 9, 13, 15, and 17 should be reverse scored. If you are currently using the CATSO we request that you make the necessary changes or contact the authors for the new version of the instrument. The corrected table is give in the erratum.] Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the nature of individual attitudes toward sex offenders. Because the term ""sex offender"" tends to evoke strong emotions, and given that open-ended self reports tend to be highly subjective, particularly in the context of such pointed terminology, this study sought to develop an attitude assessment tool that addresses specific domains found in the literature. Methods: Through a number of iterations, the Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offenders Scale was developed. Results: Exploratory and subsequent confirmatory factor analyses found a four-factor, 18-item version to best represent the domains of interest. Factor and item characteristics are reported. Conclusions: Replication and extension to other populations appears warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

Principal component analyses were used to reduce the items to a one-factor model with salient structure coefficients, face validity, and a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.93. Discussion and Applications: Future research should evaluate factor invariance and the construct and criterion validity of the GRBS. However, given the limitations of scales that measure similar constructs, the GRBSs brings the social work profession closer to effectively quantifying an internally consistent and homogenous latent variable that may be related to evidence-based practice.

"3135","AB","55","Objective: This report describes the development and preliminary findings regarding the reliability, validity, and sensitivity of a scale that has been developed to assess practitioners’ perceived familiarity with, attitudes about, and implementation of the phases of the evidence-based practice (EBP) process. Method: After a panel of national experts on EBP supported the scale’s content validity, social workers were surveyed by mail in Texas and Missouri to assess the scale’s internal consistency reliability and criterion validity. Additional data on the scale’s criterion validity and sensitivity were gathered in pretests and posttests of social workers participating in EBP continuing education workshops in Austin and San Antonio, Texas. Results: Preliminary findings support the scale’s internal consistency reliability, criterion validity, and sensitivity. Conclusion: In light of the current need and requests for this scale, dissemination of the preliminary findings is warranted while awaiting data collection at additional sites. These findings support the use of the scale to evaluate current efforts to educate students and practitioners in EBP. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

Objectives: (a) To identify HIV/AIDS knowledge measures created for use with adults; (b) to determine the extent to which these measures have been psychometrically tested. Method: This article systematically reviews the use of psychometric testing of HIV/AIDS knowledge measures. Results: There has been minimal reliability and validity testing; of measures that had undergone some form of psychometric testing, 71% were created before the year 2000. Conclusion: More rigorous testing of these measures is critical to ensure they are appropriate for research, prevention, and practice.

Wakeman, Sarah L. Miller, Carl B. Clements and Fei Sun (Research on Social Work Practice, 2008[May], Vol 18[3], 251-259). In the original article an incorrect item was reported in Table 4. Item # 4 (Factor 3), ""Male sex offenders should be punished more severely than female sex offenders"" should have read ""A lot of sex offenders use their victims to create pornography."" Also, items 1, 4, 9, 13, 15, and 17 should be reverse scored. If you are currently using the CATSO we request that you make the necessary changes or contact the authors for the new version of the instrument. The corrected table is give in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2008-05059-008[/rid]). Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the nature of individual attitudes toward sex offenders. Because the term ""sex offender"" tends to evoke strong emotions, and given that open-ended self reports tend to be highly subjective, particularly in the context of such pointed terminology, this study sought to develop an attitude assessment tool that addresses specific domains found in the literature. Methods: Through a number of iterations, the Community Attitudes Toward Sex Offenders Scale was developed. Results: Exploratory and subsequent confirmatory factor analyses found a four-factor, 18-item version to best represent the domains of interest. Factor and item characteristics are reported. Conclusions: Replication and extension to other populations appears warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

Method: The study details the development of the community-informed instrument and subsequent evaluation of its psychometric properties relative to one specific community sample (N = 139). Results: The initial validity and reliability testing of the community-informed instrument reveal a higher internal consistency than the standardized instrument alone (alpha = .87 vs. .80). Subsequent factor analysis and inter-item correlation suggest consistency between most of the community-informed and CES-D items. Conclusions: While limited in scope to the community sample, the study reflects the perceived benefit of integrating community voice to enhance culturally relevant and empirically rigorous practice.

"3403","AB","60","Objectives: The Trauma Resilience Scale (TRS), assessing protective factors associated with positive adaptation following violence, was tested in three waves of data collection. Empirical and theoretical literature shaped subscale and item formation emphasizing resilience following physical abuse, sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, and/or a serious threat or injury to life. Methods: Content validation experts helped refine items. The three-factor model, including problem solving, relationships, and optimism, was tested (n = 270). A four-factor model adding spirituality was also tested (n = 307). Results: Both models demonstrated strong reliability, validity, and factor analyses results. However, the four-factor model was best supported by the data. Conclusions: Both global scales and individual factor subscales are supported for clinical and research administrations.

Methods: Using NCFAS data collected by child mental health intake workers with 158 families, factor analysis was conducted to assess factor structure, and thematic analysis of intake notes was used to test content validity. Results: This study found only three NCFAS subscales. The case notes included themes specific to youth with mental health needs that were not captured by current NCFAS items. Conclusions: This study suggests variation in the fit for the NCFAS in child mental health services compared to the measurement properties established in child welfare samples.

Method: A large sample of consumers of mental health services (n = 469) were administered the TMQ-R. Results: The factor structure specified in previous research did not fit the data well. However, a five-factor model with the two subtypes of introjected (i.e., feeling guilty about not attending treatment) and external motivation (i.e., pressure to attend treatment) fit the data well. Conclusions: The current analyses partially confirm the TMQ-R structure and reflect the need for future work to evaluate the complexities of motivational measurement within people with SMI.

The sample is 293 batterers either referred by the courts, by prosecution, or who participated voluntarily. Results: The original four-factor model and the two three-factor models are demonstrated as possessing poor model fit index and fail to be accepted as apt models for a Korean context.

Method: This scale, based on social cognitive theory, was pretested, revised, and then used with a final sample of 85 master's-level students in the original study. Using a single-group, pretest-posttest retrospective design, the current study (N = 111) is a direct replication of the original ESE study. Results: In this replication, Cronbach's alphas for the ESE were .95 (pretest), .95 (posttest), and .96 (retrospective pretest). Evidence for the construct validity of the ESE is obtained. Conclusion: The results provide additional evidence supporting the psychometric properties of data obtained using the ESE, suggesting that it may be appropriate for use in educational outcomes assessment in general and accreditation-related research in particular.

The Evaluation Self-Efficacy Scale (ESE) was created to assess student progress in advanced concentration courses focused on evaluation and thereby provide data regarding attainment of EPAS-related objectives. Method: This social cognitive theory-derived scale was pretested, revised, and then used with a final sample of 85 master's-level students in a single-group, pretest-posttest-retrospective pretest study. Results: Cronbach alphas for the ESE were .94 or greater. Evidence of both content and construct validity was obtained. Conclusion: The results provide evidence that supports the psychometric properties of data obtained using the ESE. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

Method: The convenience sampling frame used for these analyses consisted of 26,781 Communities That Care Youth Surveys. The three item selection methods were used to assess known instrument, convergent construct, and concurrent criterion validities. Results: Method 3, multiple regression on 30-day use, performed the best on the correlations with outcome scales and was indistinguishable from the others on the correlations with the original. Conclusions: This study suggests that the dominant method of short form item selection, factor analysis loading, might not be only method a researcher can employ and may not be best for all purposes.

Concurrent criterion validity correlations range from r = .85 to r = .95. Correlation for known instrument validity is r = .56 and convergent construct validity is r = .49. Cut points produced positive predictive values ranging from .46 to .53. The ADSI demonstrated a general applicability across gender and race. The ADSI is an instrument demonstrating acceptable psychometric properties. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

"4065","AB","72","Objective: Confirm the factor structure of the original 18-item Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) as well as two abbreviated versions in a sample of mothers with a child in mental health treatment. Method: The factor structure, internal consistency, and concurrent validity of the MOS-SSS were assessed using a convenience sample of 330 mothers. Results: A 12-item version that included subscales and a 4-item version maintained a good fit. Conclusion: 12- and 4-item versions of the MOS-SSS are psychometrically sound social support instruments and are appropriate for clinical and research uses. Given the diverse populations that social work serves, confirming instruments in various samples is important to legitimize an instrument's use and advance the evidence base for support interventions.

Method: Surveys are completed by an older adult and a nominated adult family caregiver (N = 132). Results: Adequate internal consistency and validity are found for Chinese and Spanish with the exception of the Social Functioning (Spanish) and Vitality (Chinese) Scales. The Korean version has reliability and validity issues. Comparisons are made with English language norms and studies that use translations in Spanish and Chinese. No comparative data for Korean Americans are found. Recommendations are made for reading reports of and using SF-36 translations. Conclusion: Paying attention to options in use of translations of the SF-36 in Chinese and Spanish improves the relevance of findings to research and practice.

Method: Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on a calibration and a cross-validation sample of youth. Predictive validity was also established. Results: A four-item measure, labeled the Perceived Social Competence Scale (PSCS), demonstrated acceptable internal consistency and factorial validity in samples of children and youth participating in youth development programs. Additionally, tests for gender invariance indicated that the PSCS worked equally well for males and females. The PSCS also demonstrated predictive validity, correlating positively with perceived belonging. Conclusion: Support was found for the PSCS as an empirically sound tool to assess children and youth's perceptions of social competence.

Method: In this review 11 observational scales for assessment of pain in older adults with dementia or cognitive impairments are evaluated in four areas: pain indicators, reliability, validity, and clinical utility of the measure. Results: Results indicate that various scales are available for assessing pain in cognitively impaired or demented older adults who are unable to report their pain, but future research should focus on further psychometric evaluations. Conclusions: Implications include that social workers should be trained as raters of pain assessment methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

"4282","AB","76","Examined the measurement characteristics of the Multi-Problem Screening Inventory (MPSI) depression subscale. A sample of 542 responses to the MPSI was obtained from persons (aged 11-76 yrs) seeking assistance in any of several child and family service agencies. The responses on the depression subscale were analyzed using item response theory and generalizability theory methods. It was found that the MPSI depression subscale produced scores with verv desirable measurement properties for use in (1) monitoring a client's change in depression across time and (2) making tentative decisions concerning the clinical significance of a client's depression level. The measurement error characteristics of the MPSI depression subscale scores reach a minimum just below the clinical cutting point and then remain constant across the clinical cutting point and across the range of clinically significant depression levels. The results of this study suggest that the MPSI depression subscale can be used by social work practitioners to both assess and monitor their clients' problems with depression.

"4335","AB","77","Objective: This study tests the validity of the Rap-music Attitude and Perception (RAP) Scale, a 1-page, 24-item measure of a person's thoughts and feelings surrounding the effects and content of rap music. The RAP was designed as a rapid assessment instrument for youth programs and practitioners using rap music and hip hop culture in their work with young people, their families, and their communities. Method: The factor structure validity, criterion-related validity, and internal consistency reliability of the RAP was assessed using a convenience sample of 605 young (M=20.22 years, SD=2.8) college students. Results: Multiple groups method and structural equation modeling analyses confirmed the three-factor model (empowerment, violent-misogynistic, and artistic-esthetic) of the RAP. Reliability and criterion-related validity results were also good. Conclusions: The RAP has sound psychometric properties, and its utility as a research and assessment tool for scholars and practitioners is promising.

Yoshioka, and R. D. Ager (1994) originally developed this measure for clinical use with spouses of problem drinkers. The present report examined its utility with a sample of healthy, nonclinical adults. An assessment of the reliability and construct validity of the LDI was conducted based on a racially diverse sample of 176 men and women (aged 18-81 yrs) drawn from a medical study of body composition. A factor analysis resulted in the development of 4 sub-scales, each with adequate internal reliability. Subscale scores correlated with convergent factors in hypothesized directions and were unrelated to discriminant factors. Finally, LDI scores for these healthy adults were compared with those from a sample of HIV positive and obese patients also participating in the research. Recommendations for clinical use and future research are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

This article describes the development, psychometric analysis, and validation of the African American Respect Scale, a 20-item instrument measuring prosocial attitudes held by male adolescents. Method: The scale was administered to 200 African American male youth age 14 to 18 years; 100 were incarcerated in juvenile corrections facilities, 100 resided in the community. Results: After acceptable reliability was established, factor analysis revealed three principal components labeled societal, family, and peer subscales. The subscales correlated with racial socialization and predicted the use of violence. Nonincarcerated youth scored significantly higher on all three subscales than incarcerated youth. Conclusions: Suggestions for social work practice with African American youth include assessing their attitudes toward respect, and assisting them to handle disrespect without resorting to violence.

Method: The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was translated to Chinese, and an expert panel reviewed its content validity and cultural relevance. The translated instrument (C-IRI) was administered to 189 junior high school students and 391 university students. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed a stable hierarchical three-factor structure that was consistent with structure of the English IRI, but the cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy were combined to form a new factor. The subscales of the CIRI demonstrated acceptable to good internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Some evidence for the construct validity of the measure was also found. Conclusions: The C-IRI possessed acceptable psychometric properties in Chinese adolescent samples. The present findings suggest that the cognitive and emotional aspects of empathy are not differentiated in Chinese adolescents.

Myths are rigid, stereotypical beliefs that invalidate the experiences and minimize the profound effects of sexual abuse on boys and men. This study establishes the initial psychometric properties for the SAMPS, based on a sample of 333 students enrolled in diverse courses (i.e., business, psychology, social work, urban and regional planning, and education) at a large, southern university. Results/Conclusions: The SAMPS was developed as a three-factor instrument. Preliminary findings confirm this structure and indicate the SAMPS shows promise for future uses relating to training, research, and clinical practice.

"4639","AB","83","Objective: This article reports findings of three studies addressing convergent validity and test-retest reliability of the Youth Rating Scale of the Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scale-Second Edition (BERS-2). Method: Pearson product-moment correlations were used in all three studies, the first two addressing convergent validity and the third addressing test-retest reliability. Results: Analysis indicated that (a) the six BERS-2 subscales and overall strength index were generally highly positively correlated with the social skills composite score from the Social Skills Rating System-Student Form (Secondary Level, Grades 7 to 12), (b) the BERS-2 subscales and strength index were generally moderately negatively correlated with the Problem scales of Achenbach's Youth Self-Report, and (c) test-retest reliability coefficients over a 1-week period were all above. 80. Conclusions: Results provide evidence that the BERS-2 Youth Rating Scale has acceptable psychometric properties and may be considered for use by social work practitioners in assessment and intervention activities.

This article presents a new scale for measuring this concept, the Scales of Perceived Social Support (SPSS), and evaluates some of its important psychometric properties. A total of 363 16–84 yr olds participated. The scales were found to have good internal consistency and good test-retest reliability. In terms of validity, the scales correlated well with an established support measure. Factor analyses provided corroborating evidence for the scales' two, main dimensions, namely support from family and from friends. Further study is required to assess the potential utility of the scales for single case research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

"4741","AB","85","Objective: Bibliometrics is a method of examining scholarly communications. Concerns regarding the use of bibliometrics in general, and the impact factor score (IFS) in particular, have been discussed across disciplines including social work. Although there are frequent mentions in the literature of the IFS as an indicator of the impact or quality of scholars' work, little empirical work has been published regarding the validity of such use. Method: A proportionate, stratified, random sample, of n = 323 articles was selected from 17 Web of Science listed social work journals published during the 1992 to 1994 period. Results: The relationship between journals' IFSs and the actual impact of articles published in those journals (predictive validity) was r = .41 (short term) and r = .42 (long term). Conclusion: The practice of using the IFS as a proxy indicator of article impact merits significant concern as well as further empirical investigation.

A practical way to accomplish this is to use rapid assessment instruments (RAIs) to measure a client's level of functioning so that any subsequent change in functioning can be accurately detected over time. This first article in this 2-part series (see record [rid]2002-13005-005[/rid]) outlined how to conceptualize and create an RAI, and how to plan and subsequently implement a design testing the newly created scale's psychometric properties, laying the ground work for Part 2 of this series. The purpose of this article is to further develop the foundations that were introduced in Part 1 by using the authors' own works to illustrate how to develop a new scale and test its psychometric properties. Decision-making strategies and standards for how to interpret scale psychometrics are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

Data from the present clinical sample suggests that the CABS has strong internal consistency as well as strong concurrent validity. The mean scores of participants in the clinical sample were significantly higher than two subgroups of the norming sample. The results suggest that the CABS can be validly and reliably used in a clinical setting with adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse.

"4926","AB","89","Cultural competence has become a central social work tenet enshrined in the profession’s ethical and educational standards. Few measures of cultural competence exist, however, in spite of an increasing array of religious, ethnic, and racial groups in U.S. society. This article develops a new measure to assess cultural competence among one family of cultural groups—spiritual and religious cultures. More specifically, this scale measures respondents’ perceptions of spiritual competence at the programmatic level. To develop the eight-item scale, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with a random sample of graduate students affiliated with the National Association of Social Workers (N=303). The results suggest that the scale is a valid and reliable measure of the values dimension of spiritual competence. Although the instrument is designed to assess levels of competence in educational programs, with modification it may also be possible to use the scale in agency settings and perhaps for individual self-assessment as well.

"4980","AB","90","In this age of accountability, social work practitioners face greater demands to demonstrate the effectiveness of their interventions. A practical way to accomplish this is to use rapid assessment instruments (RAIs) to measure a client's level of functioning so that any subsequent change in functioning can be accurately detected over time. Although great strides have been made during the past three decades in the development of RAIs, there remains a paucity of reliable and valid scales when compared to the increasingly complex range of problems that practitioners confront in their day-to-day work with clients. This article, the first in a two-part series, outlines how to conceptualize and create a scale and how to plan and subsequently implement a design testing the newly created scale's reliability and validity. The second article in this series provides illustrations of these steps from the authors' own works, detailing decision making and strategies for analyzing psychometric data.

This study reports the psychometric properties of the CCC. The measure's dimensionality, reliability (internal consistency and test-retest), standard error of measurement, and validity (convergent, concurrent, treatment sensitivity) were evaluated in a project involving 171 sixth-grade students (mean age 11.8 yrs). Factor analysis indicated 4 dimensions called Learning Orientation (behaviors and attributes related to classroom success), Relational Aggression, Social Involvement, and Physical Aggression. The measure has high internal consistency with low measurement error. Test-retest findings suggest a stable measure. The CCC has good convergent and concurrent validity and appears sensitive to treatment effects. The CCC is a promising measure for social workers assessing risk and protective factors related to childhood aggression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

Reliability and validity were examined using results from 244 clients in 6 agencies. Further tests of the short form were completed on 62 clients from 3 agencies. Findings indicate that the same items comprising the short-form English-language version can be used as a short-form of the Spanish version, that both versions have factor structures comparable to their English-language counterparts, and both have high internal consistency. Evidence of good content and criterion validity for each version was also obtained, though total scores on both versions correlated moderately with measures of depression and anxiety. Both forms appear to have acceptable measurement characteristics and perform similarly to English-language versions, except for the question of whether they measure satisfaction independently of mood states. This and possible effects of cultural differences on assessing service satisfaction are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

A number of concerns, however, have been raised about the validity and reliability of the previous FACES measures and their ability to assess the Circumplex Model. Limitations of previous FACES measures have resulted in the development of the FACES IV measure. J. W. Tiesel and D. H. Olson recently completed the first reliability and validity study of the FACES IV measure. This article uses data from an adolescent population (105 females aged 11-21 yrs) to further examine the psychometric properties of the new FACES IV measure. Reliability and validity analyses offer both corroborating and contradictory results when compared with the validity study conducted by Tiesel and Olson. Future directions for the development of FACES IV are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

"5257","AB","96","This article summarizes critical evaluation needs, challenges, and lessons learned in translational research. Evaluation can play a key role in enhancing successful application of research-based programs and tools as well as informing program refinement and future research. Discussion centers on what is unique about evaluating programs and policies for implementation impact (or potential for dissemination). Central issues reviewed include the importance of context and local issues, robustness and external validity issues, multiple levels of evaluation, implementation fidelity versus customization, choosing evaluation designs to fit questions, and who participates and characteristics of success at each stage of program recruitment, delivery, and outcome. The use of mixed quantitative and qualitative methods is especially important, and the primary redirection that is needed is to focus on questions of decision makers and potential adoptees rather than the research colleagues.

"5306","AB","97","A statewide data collection effort was implemented to assess the validity and reliability of a 52-item consumer assessment instrument of the cultural competency mental health providers. Following a 2-year, community-driven instrument development process, a consumer assessment tool was administered to 238 African American, Latino, and Vietnamese American mental health consumers across the state of Maryland. A subsequent principal components analysis indicated that 44 of the 52 items loaded on one of four factors, which accounted for 52 % of the variance in the principal components analysis. It was also found that the overall instrument had a Cronbach's alpha of.92. The authors conclude that although these findings suggest this scale has good psychometric properties and can be used as a clinical tool in the assessment of the cultural competency of mental health providers, more work is needed to fine-tune the scale.

This study was designed to adapt and validate a Spanish translation of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) for the assessment of positive life changes following the stressful experiences of immigration. Method. A cross-cultural equivalence model was used to pursue semantic, content, conceptual, and technical equivalence. Translation teams and back translations were employed for semantic and content equivalence. Conceptual and technical equivalence were assessed through field-testing the reliability and factor structure of the translated PTGI in a sample of 100 Latina immigrants. Results. The translated version was highly reliable. Factor analysis failed to replicate the original five factors but the three factors identified were consistent with the conceptual underpinnings of the PTGI and another translated version. Conclusions. Semantic, content, conceptual, and technical equivalence of the Spanish version of the PTGI were supported and thus its valid use for research and practice with the study population.

The FS was validated using a convenience sample of 311 males. The assessment packet contained a demographic form, the Conflict Tactics Scale (2), Self-Esteem Scale, and the Fatherhood Scale. A series of factor analysis resulted in 13 factors accounting for 75% of the variance. Factors with high correlations that were theoretically related to other factors were combined resulting in nine subscales measuring positive and negative paternal engagement, fatherhood roles, and paternal emotional responsiveness. The subscales attained high levels of internal consistency reliability, with alpha levels ranging from 0.80 to 0.96. The scale has an overall reliability of 0.98, and showed preliminary evidence of differentiating between groups of men on self-esteem and intimate partner violence. The FS is a new assessment tool designed for use by social work practitioners and researchers to assess an individual's relationship with his father.

"5451","AB","100","Reviews the book, Secondary Data Analysis by T. Vartanian (see record [rid]2010-21231-000[/rid]). The book is one-part primer for the novice and one-part reference guide for the advanced researcher. The author ably negotiates the often conflicting needs of the two styles. Two concepts are implicit in the book’s topic, one is the thrill of exploring knowledge through data discovery and the other is the critical need for good guidance in finding the right data set for the research question. The second implicit idea in the book, that good guidance is critical to finding and using secondary data, might remove the book from the use of the beginner. The book expends effective efforts encouraging the beginner to approach online secondary data sets foremost, and the author offers several current online locations to seek data. The book is useful to professional and preprofessional researchers. The book is brief and the writing is direct, clear, and efficient. The purpose of introducing some of the technical application of secondary data sets in the book is well met as the reader is sure to value the introductory chapters and may look again for specific data sets when next beginning a research project.

This article describes the BAAS; provides information about its administration, scoring, and interpretation; and reports findings with regard to the psychometric characteristics of the scale. Data from 291 adult participants were collected and used to assess the scale's psychometric properties. Findings suggest that the BAAS has strong internal consistency, good factorial and content validities, and preliminary construct validity. Although further research must examine the scale's known-groups concurrent validity and clinical cutting scores, the BAAS appears to be appropriate for use by social workers as an aid to diagnosis, treatment planning, and evaluation.

The one-page 48-item instrument was developed with the support of the National Institute of Mental Health to describe internalizing (withdrawn, anxious, depressed) and externalizing (aggressive, antisocial, violent) profiles of children in both home/residential and school/classroom settings. Psychometric data supporting the reliability and validity of the SAC are presented for a sample of 3,790 children served by one state's child welfare and juvenile justice system.

The main form of analysis is factor analysis, reliability and validity analyses, and t tests. The analysis resulted in a valid and reliable multidimensional scale that is conceptually based. Hypotheses that survivors of CSA would score significantly higher than nonsurvivors and that female and male survivors of CSA would not have significant differences in subscale and total scale scores were supported. It is concluded that the scale reported here should be tested with known groups to further establish its validity and usefulness in the clinical assessment and intervention process of adult survivors of CSA.

This study describes the use of a client-centered approach to developing a client satisfaction measure for a case management setting, Client Satisfaction: Case Management (CSAT-CM). The CSAT-CM overcomes major limitations associated with prior client satisfaction studies and can be used to collect client satisfaction data that will provide concrete feedback for the service providers to improve their case management services. Preliminary results indicate that CSAT-CM has desirable psychometric properties. The proposed practical method of measuring client satisfaction has the potential to be adapted by other types of social service agencies.

"5742","AB","106","Objective: There is no validated self-report measure of parental psychological control in the Chinese culture. The reliability and validity of the Chinese Paternal Psychological Control Scale (CPPCS) and Chinese Maternal Psychological Control Scale (CMPCS) were examined. Method: A total of 3,017 Chinese secondary school students responded to the CPPCS and CMPCS and measures of psychological well-being, parent-child relational qualities, parental knowledge, parental monitoring, and perceived parental endorsement of traditional Chinese parenting beliefs. Results: The CPPCS and CMPCS were internally consistent in different samples. Evidence supporting the convergent validity (negative relationships between the CPPCS and CMPCS with psychological well-being, parent-child relational qualities, and parental knowledge but positive relationship with perceived parental endorsement of traditional Chinese parental beliefs) and discriminant validity (weak relationship between psychological control measures and parental monitoring) of these two measures was found. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the CPPCS and CMPCS possess sound psychometric properties that can objectively assess perceived parental psychological control in Chinese adolescents.

Implementing a nationwide survey using convenience sampling, an assessment packet containing the LE-PAS, two established scales (the Index of Self-Esteem and the General Contentment Scale), and demographic information was completed by 45 abused (mean age 37 yrs) and 33 nonabused lesbians. A series of factor analyses resulted in 6 factors (communication and social skills, substance abuse, intergenerational transmission of violence, fakes illness, internalized homophobia, and status differentials) accounting for 77.3% of all item variance. The 25-item LE-PAS-R shows evidence of strong reliability, credible concurrent validity, and the ability to differentiate between abused and nonabused lesbians. Further validation of the LE-PAS-R will provide evidence of its ability to assist clinicians in identifying lesbian relationships in which power imbalance may result in partner abuse.

The framework focuses on basic conceptualizations of SCS, the psychometric characteristics of the measures, and their clinical utility. Suggestions are made for both using and improving existing measures of SCS in social work practices. The review indicates that many measures that have acceptable reliability and validity exist to assess several different types and sources of SCS. Several of these measures have potential for clinical practice: the Family Relationships Index and the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire—Family and Friends show the most promise as rapid assessment tools for clinical practice.

"5929","AB","110","Objective: Existing studies of lay explanations of poverty in the social work literature are plagued with methodological problems. The psychometric properties of the 13-item Chinese Perceived Causes of Poverty Scale (CPCPS), which assessed four categories of explanations of poverty, were examined. Method: Chinese parents and their adolescent children from 229 families experiencing economic hardship were asked to respond to the CPCPS. Results: Results consistently showed that four factors were abstracted from the scale: Personal Problems, Exploitation, Lack of Opportunity, and Fate. The four related subscales were also found to be internally consistent, and there was some support for their construct validity. Conclusions: The present study suggests that the CPCPS possesses sound psychometric properties. The findings also point out the importance of empirically demonstrating the existence of measures assessing different constructs when social work practitioners and researchers examine lay explanations of poverty.

The SS-B is represented by subscales describing 5 central categories of supportive behaviors (Emotional, Socializing, Practical, Financial, and Advice/Guidance), assessed for both friends and family. The SS-B was administered to a low SES, mixed-race (19% Anglo, 37% African American, and 40% Hispanic) sample of 105 adolescents who were attending pregnancy prevention programs. A trend toward high scores, low variance, and few differences between pregnant/parenting and nonpregnant/parenting teens were found on subscale scores. Factor analyses on separate subscales showed loadings more consistently for ""family"" than ""friends."" Overall results of psychometric analysis indicate that the scale needs further work to more accurately assess the salient behavioral dimensions of social support for samples from varying racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.

The measure's properties were tested at two different points of group development, early and late group. The closed-ended groups were led by 13 graduate social work students and consisted of 86 student peers. The measure had excellent reliability at both administrations, with coefficient alphas of .97 and low Standard Error of Measurements. The construct- and criterion-related validity analyses were generally favorable. Conclusions: The GEM is a promising tool for social group workers interested in monitoring and improving their service. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"

The HC scale is a 20-item scale that evolved from a 30-item Homesickness, Loneliness, and Depression scale. The HC scale is intended to be culturally sensitive to an Asian population in measuring emotional and psychological adjustment to a new culture. Unlike other measures of adjustment developed for and tested on Western samples, the HC scale takes into account the private nature of Asians when examining symptoms of homesickness and contentment. Data collected from 201 Chinese and Korean graduate students and spouses in an American university were used for various psychometric tests. Overall, the HC scale showed excellent subscale reliability, high global reliability, high face and factorial validities, and preliminary construct validity. Discussions on validity, reliability, and utility are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)"

A brief history of PTSD in children is presented, and current research concerning prevalence rates is briefly summarized. Diagnostic classifications used in assessing PTSD in children are further reviewed including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood. Five standardized measures and one global assessment measure that have been used in screening and diagnosing children at risk for PTSD are examined in relationship to their psychometric properties and clinical utility. Finally, the authors provide guidelines for which measures to use in social work practice and make suggestions for additional strategies and further developing assessment protocols in this area.

"6287","AB","118","The Hospital Social Work Self-Efficacy Scale (HSWSE), based on A. Bandura's social cognitive theory, is intended to measure social workers' confidence regarding their ability to perform specific aspects of hospital social work. The scale was developed for a hospital-based fieldwork evaluation (L. Cuzzi et al, 1996). Results from that study provide support for the reliability and validity of the HSWSE Scale. The study reported here was an attempt to replicate those findings regarding the psychometric properties of the scale. 22 1st- and 2nd-yr social work students indicated how confident they are today in their ability to successfully perform each task. The measurement package also included a modified version of the Self Efficacy Scale (M. Sherer et al, 1983, 1982) along with the Work Environment Scale (R. Moos, 1985, 1986). The scales were used on 4 measurement occasions. Support was again found for the reliability and validity of the HSWSE Scale. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)"
